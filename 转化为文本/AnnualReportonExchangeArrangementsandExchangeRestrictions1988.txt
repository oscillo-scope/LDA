Not for Redistribution Preface The Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions has been published annually by the Fund since 1950. It draws on information available to the Fund from a number of sources, including that provided in the course of official visits to member countries, and it has been prepared in close consultation with national authorities. The project is coordinated in the Exchange Restrictions Division of the Exchange and Trade Relations Department. It draws on the specialized contributions of staff of that Department (for specific countries), with assistance from staff members of the Fund's five Area Departments, together with staff of other Departments.

Introduction The period covered by this Report is 1987 and, for major developments, the first quarter of 1988. The International Monetary Fund's Articles of Agreement call for member countries to provide the Fund with a comprehensive description of their exchange rate arrangements and exchange controls and changes in these as they occur. The Report focuses on exchange arrangements and exchange restrictions. However, measures modifying members' restrictions on trade are also monitored by the Fund in the context of its function of surveillance over exchange rate policies of members. The Report also includes other external economic policy measures and intergovernmental arrangements that have direct balance of payments implications. As in previous Reports, in the descriptions of members' systems, questions of definition and jurisdiction have not been raised; the description in the Report of a restrictive practice by a member does not mean that it is or is not being maintained consistently with the Fund's Articles, or that, if subject to Article VIII, it has or has not been approved by the Fund. Global Environment In 1987 the global economy continued to expand for the fifth consecutive year since the recession in 1980-82. World economic output rose by an esti- mated 3 percent in 1987, only marginally less than in 1986, and the growth in the volume of world trade accelerated somewhat to almost 5 percent. During the five years of economic expansion since 1982, the rate of growth of world trade volume has been generally higher than the rate of world output growth, despite continuing protectionist pressures, reflecting a further increase of economic interde- pendence in real as well as financial sectors of Fund members (Chart 1). The slightly lower rate of world output growth in 1987 was entirely on account of a slowdown in developing countries and in Eastern European coun- tries, whereas output growth in industrial countries actually accelerated to 3.1 percent from 2.7 percent in 1986. Output growth in non-fuel exporting de- veloping countries slowed to 4.5 percent from nearly 6 percent in 1986, a development which is largely explained by a drought-related temporary slowing of economic activity in India and a marked decel- eration in Brazil. Excluding developments in these two countries, output in the group of non-fuel exporting developing countries grew by about 5.5 percent, slightly less than in the preceding year. Inflation, measured on the basis of consumer prices, rose modestly in industrial countries in 1987 under the impact of a tightening of world markets for most primary commodities in the second half of the year and the partial recovery of oil prices. However, in developing countries inflation accel- erated by more than 10 percentage points, reflecting more accommodating monetary policies in some countries. Against this background of continuing economic growth and divergent inflation developments, fur- 3 ©International Monetary Fund.

Prior to 1978, the People's Republic of China is excluded. ther important changes in the global trade pattern occurred in 1987. On the one hand, the rate of import volume growth of industrial countries slowed down significantly to 5.7 percent from 9 percent in 1986, largely on account of a marked deceleration in import volume growth in the United States. On the other hand, the volume of imports of developing countries grew by nearly 3 percent in 1987 after a decline of 4.5 percent in 1986. However, the volume of imports of fuel exporting developing countries continued to contract markedly by 12 percent, implying a near-halving of the level of imports since 1981, while the import volume growth of non-fuel exporting developing countries expanded by slightly more than 7 percent following a small increase by 1 percent in 1986. On the export side, the change in trade patterns was similarly striking. Responding in large measure to the sharp depreciation of the U.S. dollar over the past three years, U.S. exports increased by over 20 percent in volume during 1986-87, whereas the growth of Japan's export volume decelerated to remain virtually unchanged during the same period, and the export volume growth of European indus- trial countries also decelerated markedly. Market shares of non-fuel exporting developing countries rose significantly in 1987 as a result of a 10 percent increase in their export volume, partly reflecting 4 fur ther improvements in the export performance of newly industrialized Asian economies, but also reflecting higher export growth of other developing countries in Asia, Europe, and the Western Hemi- sphere. In contrast, there was a decline in the volume of exports from developing countries in the Middle East and Africa. The combined terms of trade of fuel and non-fuel exporting developing countries improved in 1987 by nearly 3.5 percen t, largely on account of an im- provement of nearly 12 percent in the terms of trade of fuel exporting developing countries. However, this improvement only slightly reversed the dramatic deterioration that developing countries experienced in 1986, when their combined terms of trade dete- riorated by almost 20 percent as a result of the sharp decline in oil prices and weakening world market prices of other major primary commodities. As the improvement in 1987 reflected in the first instance the partial recovery of oil prices, fuel exporting developing countries experienced an im- provement of some 11.5 percent in their terms of trade in 1987, following a deterioration of nearly 50 percent in 1986. Non-oil commodity prices began to recover in the second half of 1987, after prices, weighted according to the trade pattern of deve- loping countries, hit the bottom of a three-year decline in mid-1987. Nevertheless, for the year as a whole, the terms of trade of non-fuel exporting developing countries improved by less than 1 per- cent in 1987 after a deterioration of about 3 percent in 1986. The process of reducing external imbalances in developing countries, which had begun in 1983 and which was reversed in 1986 as a result of the deterioration of the external current account posi- tion of fuel exporting developing countries, was resumed in 1987. The continuing decline in imports resulting from strong adjustments in fuel exporting developing countries brought about a significant reduction in their combined current account deficit. The aggregate current account position of non-fuel exporting developing countries also strengthened; as a group, these countries recorded a surplus for the first time in at least 20 years. However, this surplus was largely a result of further improvements in the export performance of developing countries in the Asian region. The combined current account deficit of developing countries that have experienced debt-servicing problems in recent years —that is, countries having incurred external payments arrears during 1986 or rescheduled debt service obligations during 1984-86 (all outside of the Asian region)— declined to US$15 billion in 1987. This compares ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION to a peak of US$73 billion in 1981, from which the deficit had declined gradually to US$7 billion in 1985 before rising again to US$22 billion in 1986. The aggregated current account deficits of deve- loping countries in Africa and the Western Hemi- sphere were also reduced in 1987, but their levels remained high compared with 1985. Within the group of industrial countries, the adjustments that have occurred in the pattern of trade flows have not been sufficient to correct the large current account imbalances that emerged dur- ing the 1980s. The deficit of the United States widened by a fur ther US$20 billion in 1987, to US$161 billion, whereas the surplus of the Federal Republic of Germany increased by US$6 billion to US$44 billion, and Japan 's su rp lus remained ap- proximately stable at around US$87 billion. How- ever, these developments in nominal balances in part reflected the so-called J-curve effects of the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of other industrial countries. The declining trend of interest rates observed since 1984 came to a halt in 1987. Fears of a resurgence of inflationary pressures, as well as efforts to support the dollar, led to a gradual firming of interest rates in the United States during much of 1987. As a result, interest differentials widened significantly in favor of dollar-denominated assets. The sharp decline in stock market prices in October 1987, which, it was initially feared, might induce a significant decline in consumer demand, appears to have affected consumers only moderately in the short run. However, in the aftermath of the stock market decline, interest rates declined following an injection of liquidity by central banks; the decline probably also reflected expectations of weaker eco- nomic growth and a moderation of inflation fears. The total debt of developing countries is estimated to have risen in 1987 by some 8.5 percent in terms of the U.S. dollar; about 5 percentage points of th is increase is estimated to have reflected the depre- ciation of the U.S. dollar during the year. Never- theless, the ratio of developing countries' external outstanding debt to receipts from exports of goods and services is estimated to have fallen significantly in 1987, for the first time since 1980, as the value of receipts from exports of goods and services rose by about 20 percent in U.S. dollar terms. Debt service payments effected in 1987, as a percentage of exports of goods and services, declined to 19 percent from a peak of 22 percent in 1986 for the group of developing countries as a whole, partly reflecting a significant increase in debt deferment granted under restructuring arrangements. Developments in Exchange Restrictions and Trade Policies As in preceding years, the continuation of large trade imbalances and persistently high levels of unemployment in some European countries was at the root of strong protectionist pressures for new trade restrictions in the industrial countries. The vulnerability of governments to these pressures is reflected in a fur ther tightening of quantitative re- strictions in industrial countries, often in the form of vo lun ta ry export res tra int or similar arrange- men ts. Industrial countries also introduced fur ther countervailing and antidumping duties. Following the launching, in September 1986, of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), contracting parties entered into the "initial phase" of the negotiations. The partic- ipants devoted the initial phase, which was com- pleted by end-1987, primarily to the reaching of agreements on negotiating techniques and modali- ties as well as the clarification of initial positions. Considerable concern was expressed at the final meeting of the Group of Negotiations on Goods in December 1987 that the standstill and rollback commitment is not being fu l ly observed. In 1987 no country informed the Surveillance Body that it intended to roll back measures that were inconsis- tent with GATT regulations. In fact, numerous allegations were made to the Body of measures being taken, mainly by industrial countries, that breached the standstill comm i tmen t. In 1987 the number of significant measures taken by industrial countries to increase reliance on quan- titative trade restrictions greatly outweighed the number of liberalizing measures. Despite the com- mencement of the new multilateral initiatives within the GATT, these measures —both restrictive and liberalizing —were increasingly bilateral or regional in character. The number of bilateral vo lun tary export restraint arrangements increased sharply, mainly protecting the European Communities (EC) market or the market of one of its members, the U.S. market, and the Canadian market. The largest number of arrangements outside the Mu l t if iber Ar- rangement (MFA) pertained to steel products. In the automobile and transport equipment sector, Japan extended by one more year the vo lun tary restraint system applied since 1981 for car exports to the United States and agreed to limit the increase of car sales to the EC in 1987 at 10 percent of the 1986 level; the voluntary export restraint on car 5 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS sales to Canada lapsed in March 1987 and was not extended. Following the decision by the GATT Textiles Committee in August 1986 to extend the MFA for five years to July 31,1991, a large number of bilateral arrangements were signed by industrial countries with other participating countries in 1987. In addi- tion, a number of voluntary export restraint arrange- ments were signed by major industrial countries with countries not participating in the MFA to limit competition in their markets for textile products. With respect to tariff measures, Australia contin- ued the process of adjusting its tariff structure with the announcement of a seven-year plan to restruc- ture the textile, clothing, and footwear industries, and to eliminate tariff quotas by 1996. Regarding bilateral trade policies within the group of industrial countries, the most important devel- opment was the announcement, in October 1987, of successful negotiations for a free trade area between Canada and the United States. The United States also agreed to a bilateral framework for trade and investment consultations with Mexico. Several trade conflicts involving agricultural prod- ucts were avoided or temporarily adjourned. In November 1987 the EC delayed for 18 months a ban on beef treated with growth hormones, thus averting a conflict with the United States. In Feb- ruary 1988 a GATT Panel Report that recommended that Japan eliminate import curbs on ten categories of food products was adopted. In developing countries the trend toward import liberalization observed in 1986 continued in 1987. In the group of fuel exporting developing countries, Indonesia, Iraq, and Tunisia undertook measures to remove quantitative import restrictions, and no country in this group tightened its system of quan- titative import controls. In the group of non-fuel exporting developing countries, most changes in quantitative import controls were also in the direc- tion of liberalization, and in some cases encom- passed far-reaching reforms. Among countries float- ing their exchange rates, Maldives removed the foreign exchange financing requirement through the banking system for the issuance of import licenses, and Ghana eliminated the restrictions on import financing through the foreign exchange auction mar- ket, with a few specified exceptions. The range of imports subject to administrative licensing was nar- rowed in several developing countries (Guinea- Bissau, Haiti, Honduras, Korea, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Uganda), and a number of other countries admitted imports of certain items previously pro- hibited or restricted (Argentina, Bangladesh, Ec- 6 uador, India, Niger, the People's Republic of China, Thailand). Only a few developing countries were reported to have intensified quantitative import restrictions on a broad range of products, although a number of countries imposed quantitative restrictions on a product-by-product basis. Moreover, the number of instances in which the system of quantitative import restrictions was liberalized in the developing countries by far exceeded, as in 1986, the number of restrictive changes in this group of countries. The process of reducing import tariffs under the Tokyo round agreements continued in some indus- trial countries during 1987, and some important changes were introduced by industrial countries in the functioning of the Generalized System of Pref- erences (GSP). Significant reductions in import duties occurred in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and Switzerland. Switzerland implemented the last stage of the reduction of import duty rates pledged under the Tokyo round of negotiations, and in parallel, reduced the preferential rates for deve- loping countries on items that do not receive duty- free treatment. The United States restored Poland's most-favored-nation status in February 1987, thus terminating sanctions imposed earlier. A major re- vision in its GSP was undertaken by the EC with respect to industrial products, in which the number of sensitive products was reduced, 24 individual quotas were eliminated, and some preferential limits were increased. At the same time, preferences were removed through the implementation of a differen- tiating strategy in 29 cases on the basis of findings that the suppliers had become sufficiently compet- itive. Japan also increased the selectivity of pref- erences by reducing individual country ceilings, and extended the system of preferences to allow for more imports. The United States modified its system of preferences to improve benefits for less advanced developing countries and announced the graduation of some of the most advanced developing countries from the program (Bahrain, Bermuda, Nauru, and Brunei, with effect from July 1988; and Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan Province of China,t with effect from January 1989). The sharp upward trend in the utilization of antidumping measures that had been,observed in industrial countries in previous years did not con- tinue in 1987. Nevertheless, further antidumping duties were introduced by the EC on imports of outboard motors, by Canada on various products, and by the United States on several steel products tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 61. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION from a number of countries and on certain other products. A long-standing dispute between the United States and the EC on pasta export subsidies was finally settled in August 1987. An important devel- opment in the field of antidumping measures was the extension, under specified conditions, of EC antidumping regulations to manufacturers within the EC that are closely tied to companies outside the EC and are already subject to antidumping levies. In the area of quantitative export restrictions, four industrial countries (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden) extended existing or introduced new restrictions in 1987, whereas no liberalizing changes were reported for industrial countries. In the group of developing countries, four countries (Ethiopia, India, Israel, and Korea) introduced new quan t i ta t ive export res tr ic t ions, whereas only two countries (Argentina and Sri Lanka) eliminated certain quantitative restrictions on exports. Fiscal incentives for exports were removed in 1987 in one industrial country (New Zealand) and two developing countries (Greece and Uruguay), whereas three developing countries (Argentina, Bo- livia, and Jamaica) introduced new incentives, and three other developing countries (Chile, Cote d'lvoire, and Turkey) increased the scope of existing export subsidies. Taxes on exports were completely eliminated in Haiti, and for all but one product in Guinea-Bissau; significant reductions in export du- ties occurred in Argentina, Colombia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Zaire. New levies on certain exports were introduced in Dominica and export levies were raised in Sierra Leone. A number of developing countries abolished or significantly reduced surren- der requirements for export receipts in 1987, mostly in the framework of continuing reforms of the exchange system. Surrender requirements for ex- port receipts were intensified in three developing countries. The trend toward liberalization of current invisible payments and unrequited transfers that had emerged in 1986 continued in 1987, as a number of developing countries increased foreign exchange allowances for travel abroad, and several developing countries eased regulations on other invisible transactions. Only a few developing countries tightened restric- tions on current invisibles, primarily with the inten- tion of controlling capital flight. In the group of industrial countries, where relatively few restric- tions on current invisibles and unrequ i ted transfers are being maintained, Italy raised the limit on sales of foreign exchange to residents for travel abroad and relaxed regulations governing the import and export of foreign and domestic currency notes and holdings of foreign currency. During 1987 there was a considerable reduction in the total amount of outstanding external payments arrears of Fund members. A f ter a significant in- crease by some SDR 8 billion in 1986, external payments arrears are estimated to have declined by about SDR 7 million in 1987. The number of Fund members having external payments arrears declined in 1987, as five members (Afghanistan, Cape Verde, Gabon, Jamaica, and Western Samoa) eliminated existing arrears. Two members (Burma and Panama) that did not have arrears previously incurred them during 1987, and arrears re-emerged in one other member country (Ecuador). Reschedulings of pay- ments arrears were an important cause for the decline of the total amount of arrears in 1987, and the rescheduling of arrears due by three countries (Brazil, Egypt, and Poland) accounted for over 90 percent of total arrears rescheduled in 1987. Overall, 19 Fund members with external payments arrears concluded multilateral debt renegotiations with official and commercial creditors in 1987. External debt obligations covered by restructuring agreements signed by Fund members in 1987 are estimated at US$117 billion, compared with US$76 billion covered by arrangements signed in 1986. The trend toward reduced reliance on multiple currency practices observed since 1985 continued in 1987, as 16 members (Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Greece, Guinea, Guyana, the Lao People's Democratic Re- public, Nigeria, Peru, Somalia, Sudan, Trinidad and Tobago, Zaire, and Zambia) either eliminated or simplified existing multiple currency practices, in- cluding cases where the coverage of transactions by market-determined or market-related exchange rates was extended. Two members (Ecuador and Grenada) reintroduced multiple currency practices eliminated in 1986, and five members (Bolivia, Ecuador, Guinea, Nicaragua, and Romania) intro- duced measures that rendered existing multiple currency practices more complex. During 1987 the number of bilateral payments a r r a n g em e n ts of F u nd m em b e rs r em a i n ed un- changed, as no member concluded or terminated such arrangements during the year. Total bilateral payments arrangements between Fund members amounted to 69, and arrangements between Fund members and non-Fund members amounted to 72. The liberalization of exchange controls on capital transactions noted in recent Annual Reports contin- ued in 1987, primarily in indus tr ial coun t r ies, re- 7 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS fleeting not only a greater reliance on exchange rate and interest rate policies as a means of influencing international capital flows, but also reduced confi- dence in the effectiveness of exchange controls. Liberalizing changes affected, inter alia, regulations governing foreign currency working balances, long- term financial investments, personal transfers, and foreign borrowing. In the group of developing coun- tries, a number of countries continued their liber- alization efforts, whereas regulations were tightened in several other countries. However, measured on the basis of the reported number of changes affecting capital transactions, liberalizing measures by far outweighed further restrictions, both in industrial and developing countries. In the group of industrial countries, Finland, Japan, Spain, and Sweden liberalized international capital transactions of commercial banks; France and Sweden opened possibilities for nonbanks to maintain accounts abroad; and France, Sweden, and Iceland allowed easier access to foreign bor- rowing by residents. In addition, Norway permitted foreigners to purchase domestic bonds; and Italy, Ireland, and Spain relaxed restrictions on outward portfolio investments. In developing countries, var- ious members undertook measures to encourage foreign direct investment, and six members (Argen- tina, Brazil, Chile, Jamaica, the Philippines, and Venezuela) introduced or extended debt-equity con- version programs; Zambia introduced a similar pro- gram aimed specifically at the reduction of external payments arrears. Other important changes in de- veloping countries include Korea's program of lib- eralization, involving the opening up of the manu- facturing sector to foreign investment, the raising of the limits on overseas investments exempted from government approval and monitoring, the re- duction of tax privileges for foreign companies, and the liberalization of restrictions on the purchase of foreign real estate by Korean companies. The general pattern of the main changes in re- strictions in 1987 is indicated in Table 1, which shows the number of liberalizing and restrictive measures of different types reported in 1987 for industrial and developing countries. The table in- dicates a preponderance of liberalizing measures, both overall and in each of the main categories of measures, with the exception of those relating to imports, where the number of restrictive changes of industrial countries exceeded significantly the number of liberalizing changes. The table also sug- gests a continuation of the broad movement toward the liberalization of exchange and trade controls in the developing countries observed in the 1987 An- nual Report, albeit from a considerably more re- strictive base than in industrial countries. It also indicates a further dismantling of exchange controls on capital movements, both in industrial and de- veloping countries. During 1987 there were no changes in the status of Article VIII or Article XIV members. Indonesia adopted Article VIII status in May 1988. Total Fund membership remained at 151. Sixty-three Fund members have accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Articles of Agreement, and 88 members avail themselves of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2. All members have notified the Fund of their decision regarding Article VIII or XIV status. Twenty-one members availing themselves of the Table 1.

Thirteen of these countries are mem- bers of the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) or the Central African Monetary Area. Developments in Exchange Rates and Exchange Arrangements The nominal effective value of the U.S. dollar,1 which had declined by 28 percent from its peak in March 1985 through December 1986, fell further by 15 percent in the course of 1987. Among the various factors that have played a role in the depreciation of the U.S. dollar since early 1985, the effects of the large and persistent U.S. current account deficit on market expectations undoubtedly has been very important. During 1987 several measures were undertaken that aimed at arresting the slide of the U.S. dollar: in particular, the Louvre accord in February 1987 expressed the commitment among the six major industrial countries to coordinate economic policy and so increase the emphasis on domestic policy adjustment in order to correct external imbalances. Following the accord, the dollar experienced rela- tive stability, appreciating at times in the middle of the year. This reflected in part large-scale interven- tion by the monetary authorities of major industrial countries and a tightening of U.S. monetary policy in May 1987. Downward pressure on the dollar re-emerged late in the year, however, reflecting the release of unfavorable monthly U.S. trade data and increasing uncertainties concerning economic prospects in the wake of the October stock market decline. On December 22 the Group of Seven issued a joint statement reaffirming the Louvre accord, and in the beginning of 1988 the dollar rose in response to continuing central bank intervention, higher interest rates in the United States, and favorable U.S. trade data. Downward pressure on the dollar re-emerged in March 1988. Largely as a counterpart to the continuing slide of the U.S. dollar, the nominal effective exchange rates of the currencies of other industrial countries, except Australia, Italy, and Canada, appreciated considerably in 1987; i.e., Japan (15.8 percent), the United Kingdom (10.7 percent), and other major 1 Nominal effective exchange rates referred to in this report are based on trade weights and derived from the Fund's multi- lateral exchange rate model (MERM). European countries (between 3-6 percent). Against the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen rose in 1987 by 29 percent in nominal terms, and Japan's current account surplus, in terms of U.S. dollars, stabilized. The pound sterling also appreciated strongly against the U.S. dollar by 27 percent, and to some extent against other major European currencies, despite the periodic interventions by the Bank of England to support the U.S. dollar. As for the currencies in the European Monetary System (EMS), their value vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar increased by 20-23 percent, except the lira. In January 1987 a realignment of the central rates within the EMS took place whereby the deutsche mark, Netherlands guilder, Belgian franc, and Luxembourg franc were appreciated against the basket of currencies determining the value of the European Currency Unit (ECU). The depreciation of the U.S. dollar and corresponding appreciation of most of the other principal curren- cies through 1985 and 1986 contributed to a greater variability in the principal exchange rates, as con- ventionally measured, than in the immediately pre- ceding years. However, while the measure of ex- change rate variability shows a significant decline for 1987, reflecting relative stability of exchange rates during large parts of the year, official inter- vention in exchange markets rose even more sharply, as indicated by international reserves movements in the industrial countries (Chart 2).

Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS In the developing countries, the trend toward greater flexibility in exchange rate arrangements observed in previous years was reversed in 1987. A number of developing countries used the exchange rate instrument to strengthen their external position, although to a smaller extent than in 1986. The unweighted composite index of developing coun- tries' real effective exchange rates declined by 11 percent in 1987, compared to a decline of 17 percent in 1986. During 1987 the average unwe igh ted ex- change rate of currencies with pegged arrangements that were adjusted against the respective foreign currencies depreciated by 24 percent in nominal terms. For members with flexible arrangements, the average (unweighted) nominal depreciation against the U.S. dollar amounted to 14.7 percent, ranging from 0.4 percent for the Jamaican dollar to 80.9 percent for the Lebanese pound. There were 14 ^classifications with respect to exchange arrangements of Fund members in 1987. Eight countries were reclassified in the direction of reduced flexibility, and three countries (Maldives, Mauritania, and Singapore) were reclassified from pegged exchange rates to floating arrangements.2 2 In Egypt, managed floating was introduced for the commercial bank foreign exchange market only. II. Developments in Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Rates Fund members are required to notify the Fund of changes in their arrangements for determining their exchange rates, in accordance with members' obligations under Article IV, Section 2(0), of the Articles of Agreement. Surveillance of exchange arrangements of members by the Fund, as required under Article IV, Section 3, is conducted in the context of regular consultations with members and during the intervening period between consulta- tions, as changes in such arrangements are assessed by the staff and communicated to the Executive Board. Under the provisions of Article IV, Fund members have the right to maintain exchange ar- rangements of their choice (other than using gold as denominator). Developments Affecting the Classification of Exchange Arrangements To facilitate implementation of the Fund's sur- veillance over exchange rate policies, members' exchange arrangements may be classified under three broad groupings, as follows: (1) pegged ar- rangements, comprising currencies that are pegged either to another currency or to a currency com- posite, including the SDR, and currencies that display limited flexibility against another currency (quasi-pegs); (2) a middle group of managed flexi- bility, comprising currencies whose values are ad- justed according to a set of indicators other than partner country exchange rates alone, or are main- tained under a system of managed floating; and (3) ''independently" floating (essentially market-deter- mined) arrangements, including cooperative ar- 10 rangements in the EMS, and independently floating regimes. The basic rationale for the classification of members' exchange arrangements is the extent and form of the flexibility that these arrangements permit, and this criterion is also applied to subcat- egorize each of these broad groupings in Table 2. In 1987, 59 changes in exchange arrangements occurred and were communicated by members to the Fund, including measures that resulted in ad- justments to exchange rates and a number of changes in the form of composite pegs. In addition, devel- opments-in members' effective (trade-weighted) ex- change rates are also monitored continually on the basis of available data to facilitate the symmetry of treatment of pegged and flexible exchange rates; the Executive Board is notified of changes in excess of 10 percent on a "real" inflation-adjusted basis when they occur. Thirty-three such notifications of changes in real effective rates since the preceding consultation with the member (or previous notifi- cation) were made in 1987,3 compared with 53 notifications in 1986. At the end of 1987,* 96 (96) members had pegged or quasi-pegged exchange arrangements, 28 (27) members had managed flexibility, and the remaining 26 (27) members had arrangements under which most or all of their currency relationships were wholly or partly independently floating (including 3 Burma, Burundi, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Iceland, India, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Paraguay, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Tanzania, Tonga, Uganda, United Kingdom, Viet Nam, Yugoslavia, Zaire. More than one notification was made in a number of these countries. * Positions as of end-1986 are shown in parentheses. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Table 2.

Commercial banks must use the Central Bank's selling rate, but are free to set their own buying rate. The exchange rate is maintained within margins of ± 1.5 percent.10 1 No current information is available relating to Democratic Kampuchea. 2 In all cases listed in this column, the U.S. dollar was the currency against which exchange rates showed limited flexibility. 3 This category consists of countries participating in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. In each case, the exchange rate is maintained within a margin of 2.25 percent around the bilateral central rates against other participating currencies, with the exception of Italy, in which case the exchange rate is maintained within a margin of 6 percent. 4 Member maintains dual exchange markets involving multiple exchange arrangements. The arrange- ment shown is that maintained in the major market. The dual exchange market in the Yemen Arab Republic was unified on January 1, 1988. 5 Exchange rates are determined on the basis of a fixed relationship to the SDR, within margins of up to ± 7.25 percent. However, because of the maintenance of a relatively stable relationship with the U.S. dollar, these margins are not always observed.

Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS the EMS currencies).4 From the inception of the present classification system in December 1981 to December 1987, the proportion of Fund members with "More Flexible" arrangements and those mem- bers maintaining a cooperative arrangement under the EMS rose from 28 percent to 36 percent; those with single currency pegs and "Flexibility Limited vis-a-vis a Single Currency" arrangements declined from 47 percent to 41 percent, and those with both currency composite arrangements decreased from 25 percent to 23 percent. The proportion of Fund members with independently floating arrangements rose from 7 percent to 13 percent, while the pro- portion maintaining a peg to the SDR declined from 11 percent to 5 percent. Although there was nearly the same number of reclassifications of arrangements in 1987 as in 1986 (i.e., 14 against 13), most changes in 1987 were in the direction of reduced flexibility (eight countries) against more flexibility in 1986 (nine countries). Among the eight, six countries ceased their more flexible exchange rate arrangements and pegged their currencies to the U.S. dollar, which was depreciating in the course of the year: Guyana, the People's Republic of Mozambique, and Sudan (from pegging to a currency composite); Sierra Leone and Zambia (from independently floating), and Somalia (from managed flexibility). The number of countries pegging their currencies to the U.S. dollar therefore increased sharply, from 32 to 38. Moreover, Israel's exchange arrangement was reclassified from a man- aged floating arrangement to pegged to a currency composite, following respective changes in August 1986. In the opposite direction, three countries abandoned pegging their currencies to a currency composite and introduced floating arrangements: Maldives (independently floating); Mauritania and Singapore (managed floating). Egypt also moved to increased flexibility, introducing a market with a system of managed floating in addition to the already existing markets. In addition, Kenya and Sao Tome and Principe modified their currency peg by moving from an SDR to another currency composite peg. In addition, two members revised their exchange arrangements, yielding no net change in classifica- tion in the course of the year: Peru moved from pegging to the U.S. dollar to managed floating, but a few months later moved back to pegging to the U.S. dollar; and the Dominican Republic moved from independently floating to managed floating, and later moved back to independently floating. Among developments affecting the classification of members' exchange arrangements in the first quarter of 1988, Spain ceased to manage the float of the peso and adopted independent floating. Ec- uador abandoned the arrangement of managed float- ing and opted for pegging to the U.S. dollar. The Dominican Republic moved from independently floating to managed floating. Vanuatu substituted a peg to another currency composite for an SDR peg, and Western Somoa was reclassified from a system of m an ag ed floating to p egg ing to a c u r r e n cy composite. Developments in the Exchange Rates of Industrial Countries A realignment of the central rates within the EMS was implemented on January 12, resulting in an appreciation of the deutsche mark, Netherlands guilder, Belgian franc, and Luxembourg franc. The Danish krone, French franc, Irish pound, and Italian lira all remained unchanged, and the notional ECU central rates5 for the pound sterling and Greek drachma were devalued. On February 22, 1987 the ministers of finance and the central bank governors of the six major industrial countries met in Paris to discuss coordination of economic policy; they issued a communique, under the Louvre accord, calling for closer cooperation in maintaining exchange rate stability around current levels —considered to be within the appropriate ranges in light of underlying economic fundamen- tals. Japan and the United States issued a joint statement on May 1, 1987, reaffirming their previous commitment made at the 1986 Tokyo summit to coordination of economic policy, as well as to the understandings in the Louvre accord and the state- ment of the Group of Seven in Washington. Down- ward pressures on the U.S. dollar re-emerged in mid-August and prevailed throughout the last quarter of 1987, and the central banks of the major industrial countries intervened, both on an individual and coordinated basis; the seven industrial countries issued another statement on December 22, 1987, reiterating their commitment to the coordination of economic policy in order to keep exchange rates stable. There were no changes in the classification of exchange arrangements of the industrial countries 4 Excluding the arrangements of Democratic Kampuchea, for which information is not available. 5 Notional rates for these currencies are established for pur- poses of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the calcu- lation of the divergence indicator. 12 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DEVELOPMENTS IN EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RATES during 1987. Eight countries in the EC maintained their cooperative arrangements under the EMS (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands). Austria and three Nordic countries (Finland, Norway, and Sweden) pegged their currency to a currency com- posite other than the SDR. The other Nordic country (Iceland) maintained a more flexible arrangement under managed floating. The currencies of the other six industrial countries (Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom) floated independently. The U.S. dollar depreciated sharply in the first quarter of 1987 in effective MERM terms.6 After appreciating s l igh t ly in the second qua r te r, it re- sumed its depreciation in the third quarter, declining sharply again in the four th quarter to a level 15 percent below that of December 1986. Over the same period, the Japanese yen underwent the largest appreciation against the U.S. dollar (28.8 percent on an end-year basis), and the Canadian dollar recorded the smallest appreciation (6.2 percent) (Table 3). As in 1986, there were sizable movements in the nominal effective exchange rates of the currencies of most industrial countries in 1987. In effective (MERM) end-of-year terms, the largest appreciation was that of the Japanese yen (15.8 percent). Other appreciations ranged from 10.7 percent (the United Kingdom) to 2.6 percent (France), whereas the currencies of the following four coun tr ies depre- ciated in effective terms: Australia (2.6 percent), Canada (1.2 percent), Italy (1.4 percent), and the United States (15.1 percent). 6 Based on the Fund's MERM, in which the implicit weighting structure takes account of the relative importance of the coun t ry 's trading partners in its direct bilateral relationships with them, of competitive relationships w i th "third" countries in particular markets, and of estimated elasticities affecting trade flows. Developments in Exchange Rate Arrangements in Other Countries Other developments not affecting the classifica- tion of exchange arrangements among the countries with exchange rates pegged to a single currency or currency composite included devaluations effected by 13 countries, ranging from 1.2 percent (Burundi) to 92 percent (Viet Nam) (Table 4). Romania re- valued its noncommercial exchange rate by 12 percent. Seven countries implemented other changes in their exchange arrangements, such as adjusting surrender requirements or changing the number of multiple exchange rates.7 Other changes that did not directly affect exchange rates were the ban on some exchange operations in Venezuela and the change of basket composition in Malta. Among the currencies subject to "more flexible" arrangements other than those of the industrial countries, most changes in exchange rates in 1987 involved depreciations in terms of the U.S. dollar, the more sizable of which were recorded by Argen- tina (67 percent), Brazil (80 percent), Lebanon (81 percent), Mexico (58 percent), and Yugoslavia (63 percent) (Table 5). During 1987 the rate of depreciation of the real effective value of currencies of developing coun- tries, on a weighted average basis, moderated to around 11 percent, compared to an average of 17 percent in 1986. A few member countries' currencies (e.g., Korea) appreciated against the U.S. dollar, while those of some others (e.g., India, South Africa, and Greece) moved with the U.S. dollar, and many others depreciated strongly against the U.S. dollar (e.g., Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Nigeria). The latter group comprised mainly countries facing the most difficult adjustment problems. 7 The Yemen Arab Republic, which unified its dual exchange market on January 1, 1988, is not counted in this number. 13 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution— MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE EXCHANGE AND TRADE PRACTICES III. Main Developments in Restrictive Exchange and Trade Practices This chapter surveys major developments in members' restrictive practices affecting international trade and financial transactions. These practices take the form of either quantitative restrictions or of price- related measures that involve implicit or explicit taxes and subsidies affecting international transactions. Most of the practices are described in detail in the chronological sections of the individual country pages in Part Two of this Report. References to the detailed descriptions in Part Two may be obtained from the tables annexed to Part One, which provide summary descriptions and evaluations and are organized on a subject basis —i.e., by the type of practice involved. Quantitative Restrictions on Trade In 1987 the use of quantitative trade restrictions by industrial countries, particularly of voluntary export restraint agreements, remained extensive, whereas cases of removals of such restrictions were few. A limited number of conflicts involving agricul- tural p roduc ts were avoided or tempo ra r i ly re- solved. In November 1987 the EC averted a trade conflict with the United States by delaying until January 1, 1989 a total ban on beef treated with growth hormones. In December 1987, following a GATT panel recommendation that Japan eliminate import curbs on ten categories of food products, Japan proposed to abolish eight of them and to relax curbs on the remaining two categories. The United States rejected this proposal, arguing that a GATT Panel Report can be accepted only in its entirety. In February 1988 the Panel Report was adopted by the GATT Council of Representatives. The number of restrictions resulting from conflicts that were not resolved and new restrictions, how- ever, exceeded the number of restrictions that were removed by industrial countries. Quotas were im- posed on some agricultural products: in March 1987 Austria introduced quotas on imports of broken rice under the provisions of Article XIX of the GATT, and the United States decided to reduce its sugar import quota. The year was also characterized by a sharp increase in the number of reported voluntary export restraint arrangements from 99 arrangements at end- 1986 to 124 arrangements at end-September 1987. Of the latter, 69 protect the EC market or the market of one of its members, 48 protect the U.S. market, and 7 protect the Canadian market. The arrange- ments mainly limit exports of Japan (25), Korea (24), the EC (7), and Taiwan Province of China (6).t t See Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 61. In sectoral terms, excluding arrangements under the MFA, the largest number of arrangements (38) pertained to steel products. The EC renewed 11 of its existing 14 arrangements with major steel sup- pliers and signed an agreement with Venezuela for the first time. New arrangements with South Africa were not possible following the introduction of sanctions by the EC against th is coun t ry; the ar- rangement with Australia was not renewed, owing to the low level of steel imports originating from that country; and the arrangement with Japan was considered unnecessary because of an agreement in the form of exchange of letters that took place at the end of 1986. Spain, in March 1987, decided to limit temporarily imports of certain steel products as a safeguard measure. The United States main- tained agreements limiting steel imports from 18 countries under a five-year program introduced in 1984, which was designed to reduce the share of impor ts, from about 26 percent of domestic con- sumption, to a target of 18.5 percent. In addition, Taiwan Province of Chinat agreed to restrain steel exports to the United States, and steel exports from Sweden to the United States declined following consultations between these two countries. Finally, the United States announced plans to introduce new rules of origin for steel in order to monitor tran- shipments of steel through third countries not sub- ject to voluntary restraint arrangements. The United States increased quotas on steel imports from Mexico. Trade in the automobile and transport equipment sector was also widely regulated by means of export restraint agreements (14). Japan extended by one more year the voluntary restraint system in use since 1981 for car exports to the United States, which were to be kept at their current level of 2.3 million cars a year until March 1988.8 Also, the increase in car sales to the EC in 1987 was to be t See Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 61. 8 The United States has not requested that this restraint be renewed since March 1985. Japan has extended it by one more year, to March 1989, with exports of cars to the United States to be maintained at 2.3 million units a year during this period. 17 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS held at 10 percent of the 1986 level. By contrast, the voluntary export restraint on automobile exports to Canada lapsed in March 1987 and was not extended. Following the decision by the GATT Textiles Committee in August 1986 to extend the Multifiber Arrangement (MFA) by a five-year period to July 31, 1991, a large number of bilateral arrangements were signed by industrial countries with other par- ticipating countries in 1987. Trade in textiles was fur ther restricted by the negotiation of voluntary export restraint agreements with countries not par- ticipating in the MFA. The EC signed two agree- ments with associations of Turkish textile exporters, and the United States concluded arrangements with Bulgaria, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago, and the U.S.S.R. Moreover, agreements were reached between the United States and Bang- ladesh, Brazil, the People's Republic of China, Egypt, India, Mauritius, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Yugoslavia concerning limitations on certain textile and apparel imports from those ten countries not covered under existing control arrangements within the MFA. Textile companies in Korea and Taiwan Province of Chinat agreed to curb certain textile exports to Japan at that country's request, and France was authorized by the EC to introduce a temporary import suspension for some textile prod- ucts from the People's Republic of China, India, and Korea. These measures were objected to by the exporting countries. Taiwan Province of Chinat agreed to a voluntary export restraint arrangement on machine tools to the United States. Japan agreed to reduce or not to exceed a given share of the U.S. market for certain machine tools and Taiwan Province of Chinat de- cided unilaterally to restrain certain exports of footwear to Canada. Australia agreed to a request by the United States for a voluntary export restraint on beef to 327,500 tons for calendar year 1987, and New Zealand accepted the in troduc t ion of a vol- untary export restraint on meat exports to the United States. The United Kingdom introduced emergency measures to restrict urea imports from Hungary to 12,000 tons for 1987 and from Poland to 5,000 tons over the same period. Norway passed a bill prohib- iting trade and exchanges with South Africa and Namibia. The United States announced in October 1987 a complete embargo on imports from the Islamic Republic of Iran as part of expanded sanc- tions against that country. In developing countries the import liberalization t See Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 61. 18 trend that had been observed in 1986 continued in 1987. Among the fuel exporting developing coun- tries, Indonesia granted import permits for certain products in the textile and manufactured steel cat- egories. Tunisia liberalized its quantitative import controls by allowing unrestricted imports for enter- prises exporting more than 15 percent of their output, permitting unrestricted imports up to the value of their exports to those enterprises exporting less than 15 percent of their ou tpu t, and raising the limit on imports permitted without a license when payments are effected with funds from external sources. Moreover, most of the remaining raw materials and spare parts were transferred to an import certificate system. In Iraq private sector importers were allowed to import raw materials and capital equipment directly from suppliers abroad, provided payments were made from their own foreign exchange holdings abroad. In Ecuador the number of prohibited items and items previously requiring authorization was reduced, and certain quan t i ta t ive res tr ic t ions on imports, mainly agri- cultural products, were abolished. No fuel exporting developing countries reported a tightening in their quantitative import control systems during 1987. Most changes in quantitative import controls in non-fuel exporting developing countries were also in the direction of liberalization, and in some cases they encompassed far-reaching reforms. In Mal- dives the foreign exchange financing requirement through the banking system for the issuance of import licenses was abolished. In the Central Afri- can Republic import licenses and quotas were also abolished. In Madagascar a bidding system for some import licenses was introduced, and the amount of foreign exchange allocated for this bidding system was almost doubled in the course of the year. In Ghana the category of imports eligible for funding from the official foreign exchange auction market was expanded starting May 1987, with all imports becoming eligible for fund ing in that market by February 1988, except for five items specified in a negative list. A number of non-fuel exporting developing coun- tries substantially narrowed the range of imports subject to administrative licensing or prior author- ization. Korea, in the framework of its five-year import liberalization plan, removed 167 items from the restricted list during 1987 and added 3 items to it; 50 items were removed from the import surveil- lance list and 2 items were added to it. In Guinea- Bissau import licenses are to be automatically issued for a list of goods, excluding petroleum, covering about 50 percent of commercial imports. Haiti, after ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE EXCHANGE AND TRADE PRACTICES having reduced the number of items subject to import licenses by two thirds in 1986, reduced them further in 1987 from 35 items to 7. In Argentina a number of items, including inputs for petroleum industry paper, paper products, chemicals, and petrochemical products, were excluded from prior authorization requirements. Also, a wide range of intermediate products was added to the list of goods eligible for the temporary admission regime. Peru granted automatic approval for capital goods im- ports of a value of up to US$3,000 a transaction and US$30,000 a year to export industries. Colombia transferred, on several occasions, goods from the prior license requirement list to a free list. Uganda introduced a form of open general license (OGL) for imports by key industries, and Nepal placed 26 items under OGL. The Philippines ceased requiring prior approval for the import of a number of raw materials, such as iron and steel, plastic, paper, tobacco products, polyester fibers, textile yarns, threads, glass, and food produc ts. Honduras in- creased limits on imports not requiring import per- mits and prior authorization. Sri Lanka eliminated import licensing for yarns, textiles, and clothing. Some developing countries removed items from prohibited lists. In Bangladesh certain items on negative and restrictive import lists were deleted, and the l im i ts on indus tr ial firms' imports of re- stricted goods were doubled. India allowed the importation of raw cotton yarn for exporters, and Thailand permitted a number of tractors, and for a certain period soybean meal, to be imported. Niger abolished quantitative restrictions on cement and rice. In Western Samoa certain prohibited items were reclassified as restricted. In the Philippines, schedules for liberalization of certain goods in 1987 and by end-April 1988 were announced. Pakistan allowed duty-free imports of cotton yarn. Only a few developing countries intensified their quantitative import restrictions significantly in 1987. Zambia required applications for foreign exchange or import licenses to be submitted to the foreign exchange management committee through the com- mercial banks. In addition, all applications for ex- port re ten t ion schemes and the "No Funds In- volved" import licenses were required to be approved by the Bank of Zambia, and "No Funds Involved" import licenses were restricted to imports of essen- tial consumer goods, inputs, and machinery. The Netherlands Antilles established import quotas for 1987 and expanded the list of items subject to quotas later. In the Dominican Republic, for a period of five months, prior central bank approvals were required for import payments. In addition, a number of developing countries imposed quan t i ta t ive re- strictions on a product-by-product basis. Brazil transferred a number of items to the prohibited import list. Import licensing requirements were imposed on several items in two countries —the People's Republic of China (civil aircraft, plywood, cyanide sodium, wood pulp, and soft drinks), and Thailand (potatoes, motorcycle engines, high fruc- tose sy rup, and weaving machines; licensing re- quirements on the latter were extended for another two years). Colombia transferred certain goods from the free to the prior license list, before reversing these actions several months later. Western Samoa reclassified three items as restricted. Israel prohib- ited imports of iron and steel products and gold coins from South Africa. Liberia disallowed mining, logging, and rubber companies to import petroleum for their own uses. Grenada put candles on the negative list. Import Taxation and Import Surcharges As in recent years, some industrial countries made further reductions in the level of most-favored- nation (MFN) import tariffs in 1987. By contrast, increases in tariffs by industrial countries were rare, but there were instances of retaliatory tariffs, and strains remained apparent in the trade relations between various countries, as evidenced by the number of investigations under existing legislation of alleged unfair trading practices and demands for compensation (and implementation of countervail- ing and antidumping duties) by domestic producers claiming to be injured by imports. Moreover, im- portant changes were introduced by industrial coun- tries in the functioning of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Australia decided at end-1986 to implement an overhaul of its tariffs for the chemical and plastic industries. In place of duties, some of which were above 30 percent, a new maximum rate of 15 percent will be phased in over three to four years, beginning in February 1988. A seven-year plan for a gradual restructuring of the textiles, clothing, and footwear industries will become effective on March 1, 1989; it will entail changes in tariff protection, including increases in tariffs of up to 60 percent, and the phasing out of all tariff quotas. The effective rate of assistance to these industries, which appears to have been contingent on the continued existence of strong antidumping safeguards, increased in 1986/87. Japan implemented tariff cuts on some 90 industrial imports; progressively reduced import 19 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS tariff rates on unwrought aluminum and on alumi- num sheet, plat, and strip to 1 percent and 3 percent, respectively; and removed tariffs on 33 industrial products and on cigarettes. Japan also adopted standards for imports of 47 electrical appliances. On July 1, 1987 New Zealand reduced tariffs that were above 25 percent and not covered by industry plans by 10 percent. On January 1, 1987 Switzerland implemented the last stage of the reduction of import duty rates pledged under the Tokyo round negoti- ations, and in parallel, reduced the preferential rates for developing countries on items that do not receive duty-free treatment. The United States restored Poland's MFN status in February 1987, and thus terminated the sanctions imposed in 1981 and 1982 and at end-1986 and beginning-1987. Increases in tariffs were rare. On April 17, 1987 the United States imposed retaliatory tariffs of 100 percent on US$300 million worth of Japanese im- ports. The U.S. authorities claimed that Japan had violated the September 1986 bilateral semiconductor arrangement by failing both to increase foreign access to its markets and by dumping Japanese semiconductors in third country markets. In June and November 1987 the retaliatory tariffs were lifted on US$136 million worth of Japanese goods which corresponded to the amount of third country dump- ing, but at end-1987 retaliatory tariffs on goods worth US$164 million remained in place. Also, a GATT panel was set up to investigate the EC complaint that Japan's implementation of the United States-Japan agreement on semiconductors violated GATT rules. The EC adopted identical pro visionary tariffs on the same products as the United States did to pre-empt diversion of Japanese exports to Europe. In March 1988 the GATT panel made a preliminary finding that upheld the EC complaint. In September 1987 the United States eliminated tariff-quota surcharges on motorcycles. Switzerland levied taxes on sugar imports. Important changes were introduced in the func- tioning of the GSP by most major industrial countries in 1987. The EC revised its GSP system with respect to industrial products, reducing the number of sen- sitive products, eliminating 24 individual quotas, and increasing some preferential limits. Simulta- neously, it implemented a differentiation strategy leading to the exclusion of 29 products/countries in cases where the supplier countries in question had demonstrated their competitiveness by accounting for over 20 percent of the EC's total third countries' imports of the product concerned. A similar system may be introduced for textiles in 1988. In December 1987 the EC decided to suspend Korea's GSP 20 benefits in retaliation for that country's refusal to give EC exporters the same protection against counterfeiting as was given to the United States. Japan overhauled its GSP scheme to allow for more imports; ceiling limitations were removed on a broad range of industrial products for which preferential imports may be suspended only when they threaten to injure domestic industries. On other products, ceilings were increased by 30 percent on average. Like the EC, Japan increased the selectivity of its GSP scheme by reducing the individual country ceilings from one third to one fourth of the global product ceilings. The United States modified its GSP scheme substantially to give the most advanced developing coun tr ies a smaller share of the pro- gram's benefits and to encourage third world nations to institute intellectual property rights protection and to grant their workers internationally recognized workers' rights. Consequently, at end-1987 Chile was removed from the U.S. GSP scheme on labor rights grounds. In January 1988 Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan Province of China,! and Singapore were also removed from the scheme, effective January 1, 1989, with reference to their level of development. The same number of antidumping measures were in force in industrial countries by early 1987 as at the beginning of 1986, thus halting the sharply upward trend of previous years. Among other mea- sures,9 the EC imposed definitive antidumping du- ties on imports of outboard motors. Canada issued provisional antidumping duties on certain products (from several developed and developing countries), and definitive duties on others (from several coun- tries). The United States implemented 100 percent antidumping duties on several steel products from Brazil, the Federal Republic of Germany, Korea, and the United Kingdom; on roller bearings from Italy, Japan, and Yugoslavia; on color picture tubes from Canada, Japan, Korea, and Singapore; and on aspirin from Turkey. In August 1987 the United States settled a dispute with the EC on subsidized pasta exports. Under the terms of the agreement, 50 percent of pasta exports from the EC will not benefit from subsidies, and on the remaining 50 percent, the subsidies were to be reduced by 27.5 percentage points. The main development in antidumping duties stemmed from a change in EC regulations. In a move against foreign firms circumventing EC anti- dumping duties by setting up plants inside the Commun i ty, the Council of Ministers on June 22, t See Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 61. 9 The following listing of antidumping duties is not exhaustive. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE EXCHANGE AND TRADE PRACTICES 1987 extended its power to apply antidumping duties to manufacturers in the EC with close ties with companies outside the EC that are already subject to dumping duties, under the condition that the products are composed of more than 60 percent of parts imported from the country against which the antidumping du ty had been imposed. Japan com- plained about this decision, arguing that it could damage direct investment by Japan in the EC. Only a few antidumping or countervailing duties were eliminated. Australia terminated antidumping duties on imports of c.i. pigment blue and tires for passenger cars from Korea. Canada ended counter- vailing duties on imports of dry pasta from EC countries, and on imports of carbon steel pipes from Brazil. Among other actions related to tariffs, Japan announced in early 1987, in response to long-stand- ing complaints, that steps would be taken to reform its system of liquor taxes. Custom duties were to be cut by 30 percent in principle as from April 1987. But a number of countries supported the EC's contention that these proposals did not go far enough and that the system would still be discriminatory, as smaller taxes were being imposed on lower-grade (mostly local) than on high-quality (mostly imported) liquor. It was decided on February 4, 1987 that the issue will be resolved under the GATT's dispute settlement procedure. In 1987 changes relating to import taxation in the group of developing countries were mixed. In fuel exporting developing countries, import taxation changes were on balance in the direction of greater restrictiveness. Although a tariff reform was under- taken in Tunisia and some duty-free imports were extended in Ecuador, tariffs on certain products were reinstated in Kuwait and, for certain items, raised in Indonesia and Oman. Ecuador extended duty-free imports of inputs used in export produc- tion to additional items. Trinidad and Tobago abol- ished the 12 percent stamp du ty on books and newsprint. Kuwait, in the other direction, reinstated tariffs on certain iron and steel building materials. In Indonesia, although tariffs on 65 items were reduced, tariffs on 91 other items were raised and specific import duties were imposed on certain food products. In the People's Republic of the Congo, an additional tax rate on imports of certain specified products was increased. Oman increased the cus- toms tariff on cement. Many non-fuel exporting developing countries reduced their tariffs on imported goods. Those doing so for a broad range of goods included Papua New Guinea, where the tariff structure was simplified and the general import levy was abolished. Korea reduced a number of basic tariff rates under the five-year tariff reform program and effected addi- tional tariff cuts on a wide range of imports. Sri Lanka restructured its import tariffs, with the max- imum rate reduced from 100 percent to 60 percent and the minimum raised from zero to 5 percent, with certain exceptions; also, import tariffs on certain motor vehicles were reduced. Colombia reduced import tar iffs on capital goods and ex- empted military imports from import duties and taxes. Haiti replaced all specific tariffs by ad valorem tariffs. Mauritius reduced the maximum tariff rate to 127 percent, inclusive of stamp duties. Dominica abolished stamp du ty on imports and unified cus- toms service charges. Several other developing countries reduced duties on a narrower range of goods. In Brazil tariffs on certain products were reduced on several occasions, with several items reduced to zero, and producers of manufactured goods were entitled to exemptions from import tax on intermediate and capital goods valued at more than 10 percent of the growth of the company's exports over 1986. In South Africa import surcharges on a wide range of foodstuffs, raw material inputs, and components were elimi- nated. In Bangladesh, Benin, Sudan, and Thailand, tariffs on selected imports were reduced, and Korea lowered the tariff rate on crude oil imports. In Uruguay the official reference prices used to cal- culate import taxes on textile products were lowered by 10 percent. In addition, combined effective tariff rates were reduced. Tariff reductions in the context of international or bilateral agreements were also carried out in a few developing countries. Greece reduced the reg- ulatory tax on imports from other EC countries by 20 percent; this tax is to be phased out by January 1989. Israel lowered customs duties on imports from the EC and the United States. Chad announced a reduction on 80 percent of tariffs by 1990 and an increase on the other 20 percent, in the context of its re-entry into the Central African Customs and Economic Union. In certain other countries changes in the taxation system or in tariff rates were, on balance, mixed. Costa Rica introduced surcharges on raw materials and capital goods, but eliminated those on consumer goods. The People's Republic of China raised duties on certain brands of varnishes and lacquers, color film, and certain brands of watches, but reduced duties on a few mineral products to 6-15 percent. Bolivia replaced the preferential tariff rate of 2 percent for imports of the State Petroleum Company 21 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS (YPFB) by the uniform 20 percent rate applying to most imports, but granted interest-free deferment over three years on customs duties for capital goods. Several non-fuel exporting developing countries increased tariffs on a broad range of products. Argentina introduced an additional import surcharge of 5 percent through December 1988. Bangladesh raised the development surcharge on dutiable im- ports. Guatemala introduced a tax on imports, with exceptions. Malawi raised import du ty rates on luxury and nonessential goods, increased the max- imum import du ty rate from 45 percent to 75 percent, and the import levy from 5 percent to 10 percent. Sierra Leone revised a wide range of import taxes upward. Turkey raised the rate of import levies. Burkina Faso increased the statistical tax from 3 percent to 4 percent. In Benin a new tax on import licenses was introduced. Pakistan raised the import license fee from 2 percent to 4 percent. The Do- minican Republic introduced and raised the ex- change commission on sales of foreign exchange for imports to 5 percent, and later to 20 percent. In Hungary the customs clearance fee was increased from 2 percent to 4 percent, and the statistical fee from 3 percent to 5 percent. Nicaragua applied an exchange tax to imports of nonessential consumer and capital goods in the nonagricultural sector, as well as spare parts and capital goods used in the agricultural sector. Some of the non-fuel exporting developing coun- tries increased tariffs on a narrower scope. India increased customs duties on metal products and inputs used by manufacturers of capital equipment and electronics. Korea levied an import surcharge on coffee and raw sugar. Niger increased taxes on rice and cement imports. Cote d'lvoire increased import duties on specified products as a temporary measure. Antigua and Barbuda levied a customs tariff of 30 percent on meat. Advance Import Deposits In 1987 virtually all of the modifications of ad- vance import deposit requirements by developing countries were in the direction of liberalization. The most significant change was in Greece, where ad- vance import deposit rates were halved in February 1987, and the scheme was eliminated in May 1987. Israel reduced advance import deposit rates from 15 percent to 3 percent. The Philippines reduced the margin deposit requirement on import letters of credit from 100 percent to 50 percent. Bangladesh 22 reduced the foreign exchange deposit requirement for industrial raw material imports. The Syrian Arab Republic allowed owners of industrial plants and agricultural importers to import equipment, spare parts, and raw materials, as well as all types of animal feed not produced domestically, without prior import deposits. Egypt modified the existing advance deposit scheme that required prior import deposits of 15-50 percent on private sector imports to be constituted in foreign exchange, by introducing another scheme that requires a prior deposit of at least 35 percent in foreign exchange or local cur- rency at the time when the opening of a letter of credit is requested. This deposit cannot be financed domestically or by foreign borrowing. When the letter of credit is opened, an additional deposit of 65 percent has to be constituted in local or foreign currency; this deposit can be financed. Western Samoa eliminated advance deposit requirements for imports of motor vehicles. In the opposite direction, Guinea introduced advance deposits for certain imports in January 1987; however, they were elim- inated in May. Finally, Ecuador introduced a prior import deposit requirement. Other Measures Affecting Import Payments Some developing countries made modifications in 1987 to regulations governing the terms or pro- cedures for import payments. As in other recent years, most of these changes were in the direction of liberalization, although in fewer countries than in 1986. In the group of fuel exporting developing coun- tries, Venezuela accommodated importers in several ways. The central bank was authorized to give advances to importers upon presentation of import permits. In addition, the cost of letters of credit was allowed to be added to the amounts eligible for obtaining foreign exchange at the officially deter- mined, more appreciated exchange rates applicable to the respective imports. Exporters in Venezuela also received preferential treatment for their basic import needs, and a separate foreign exchange budget was created for private exporters. At the same time, a new import control system was intro- duced, based on an annual budget that allocates foreign exchange among importers at the beginning of each year. In the opposite direction, Indonesia imposed a requirement for importers of cotton to purchase domestically produced cotton at a speci- fied ratio relative to imported cotton. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE EXCHANGE AND TRADE PRACTICES A few non-fuel exporting developing countries liberalized exchange regulations for import financ- ing. Egypt, on several occasions, liberalized the use of foreign exchange obtained from the new bank market and export retention accounts to finance imports and services by the private sector. Guinea- Bissau permitted private sector importers with valid import licenses to use foreign exchange freely to finance imports. In Guinea, although all imports were made eligible to be effected through the auction market, a phased settlement was required for those imports effected through that market. Portugal sus- pended the requirement on foreign financing for imports of petroleum and cereals. In Zaire require- ments for prior approval from the Bank of Zaire were lifted for various categories of imports, and limits on imports beyond which importers are re- quired to submit verification certificates to their banks were raised. Regulations for imports of certain goods were also relaxed in a few non-fuel exporting developing countries. In Thailand the required per- centages of domestic purchases of silk yarn and soybean meal were reduced. Niger abolished re- strictions on the number of traders authorized to import rice and cement. Some non-fuel exporting developing countries tightened their regulations affecting imports and import payments. Sierra Leone abolished unnum- bered import licensing, which effectively disallowed private imports of goods financed by foreign ex- change from parallel markets. Peru imposed a 180- day minimum financing requirement for capital goods imports, and Fiji required authorized banks to report all sales of foreign exchange for import payments. State Trading There were few changes in the state trading practices of Fund members in 1987, with two non- fuel exporting developing coun tr ies in t roduc ing changes in the direction of liberalization, and one introducing new restrictions. Hungary expanded general trading rights of enterprises with exports of more than US$1 million in the previous year. In the People's Republic of Mozambique, enterprises were allowed to import and export directly, as well as through state trading companies. Moreover, the number of items to be traded through state trading companies was first reduced from 11 to 8 and then to 5 for import items, and from 3 to 1 for export items. All private exports of gold and diamonds were prohibited in Sierra Leone; only the govern- ment office of gold and diamonds and the Bank of Sierra Leone were authorized to export gold and diamonds, respectively. Exports and Export Proceeds Reflecting the difficult international environment, measures taken during 1987 governing exports and export proceeds followed a trend in the direction of restraint among industrial countries. Seven in- dustrial countries introduced new or modified ex- isting measures, mostly in the area of voluntary export restrictions; some extended access to special credit facilities, whereas others relaxed licensing procedures. Developing countries continued to pro- mote exports through fiscal and other incentives, by extending special credit facilities and by relaxing export licensing requirements. More than 30 deve- loping countries combined several types of measures in an effort to support exporters. During 1987 quantitative export control measures taken by industrial countries were largely of a restrictive nature. Responding to pressures from other industrial countries, Japan extended voluntary res tra in ts on exports of cars and introduced re- straints on exports of machine tools to the United States and forklift trucks to the EC. Taiwan Province of Chinat also agreed to restrain machine tool exports to the United States. Norway and Sweden imposed prohibitions on exports to South Africa and Namibia. A number of developing countries also adopted restrictive measures; Israel banned new defense contracts as well as exports of oil to South Africa. Responding to threats of protectionist measures from industrial countries, Korea subjected a list of items to voluntary restraints. India banned exports of frogs' legs; and the Lao People's Dem- ocratic Republic prohibited exports of unprocessed gnarled wood; Ethiopia restricted the export of hides and skins, and Pakistan imposed quotas on exports of cotton yarn. Four developing countries liberalized their export regulations. Sri Lanka al- lowed rough gueda conumdum to be exported to Thailand and increased the value of gifts of domestic produce and commercial samples that can be sent abroad. The re-export of imported goods and ex- ports of cotton by registered private sector export- ers, subject to certain conditions, was liberalized in Pakistan. The export ban on sorghum was lifted in Sudan, and Uruguay allowed live sheep to be exported. t See Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 61. 23 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS In the area of export licensing, only one industrial country modified its regulations. The United States expanded controls on exports to the Syrian Arab Republic and the Islamic Republic of Iran but relaxed licensing procedures and lifted restrictions on exports of oil and gas equipment to the U .S .S .R. Among developing countries, Honduras reduced licensing requirements, and licensing fees for ex- porters residing in border provinces were reduced in Thailand, except for exports of live black tiger shrimp. Licenses for exports of nontraditional prod- ucts were terminated in Sri Lanka. All private export licensing for gold and diamonds was suspended in Sierra Leone, with the Government and the Central B a nk b e c om i ng the so le e x p o r t e rs of t h e se commodities. Several countries introduced or modified fiscal incentives for exports. Among industrial countries, New Zealand eliminated the export performance tax incentive. Argentina extended the range of products qualifying for indirect tax rebates, and fiscal incen t ives were in t roduced for ind irect ex- porters in Sri Lanka. Pakistan extended the draw- backs of import du ty and sales tax that exporters pay on raw materials to include the 5 percent Iqra surcharge, the 5 percent import surcharge, and the 4 percent import license fee. Jamaica introduced a rebate for manufactured goods exported to non- Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) countries. A foreign exchange rebate equivalent to 5 percent and 10 percent for traditional and nontraditional exports, respectively, was introduced in Bolivia; and the scope of the export premium payment scheme was expanded in Chile, Cote d'lvoire, and Turkey (with the exception of cotton for which p rem ium paymen ts were d iscon t inued ). Tax ex- emptions were revised downward in Uruguay and subsidies on exports to the EC were reduced in Greece. Among fuel exporters, Venezuela stream- lined administrative procedures for subsidy payments. Relatively few developing countries revised reg- ulations on export taxation. Dominica introduced a levy on the export of bananas. Taxes on exports of coffee and cocoa were increased by Sierra Leone; Haiti eliminated export duties altogether; and Hon- duras reduced taxes on exports of coffee and ba- nanas. Argentina eliminated export taxes on several products and reduced taxes on others. The tax rate on exports of cashew nuts was reduced by Guinea- Bissau, and taxes on all other products were abol- ished; Zaire also eliminated taxes on exports of most agricultural products, and nontraditional and marine exports were freed from duties in Sri Lanka. Pakistan imposed an export duty on cotton yarn 24 equivalent to PRs 5 per kilogram. Among fuel exporters, Indonesia abolished surcharges on coffee exports. Increased access to credit facilities was extended to exporters by a small group of developing countries (Argentina, Thailand, and Turkey). There was only one major change relating to the provision of export or exchange guarantees. Venezuela eliminated the requirement to provide export guarantees by the central bank to exports to the Netherlands Antilles. Two industrial countries, Belgium and Luxem- bourg, simplified reporting procedures in 1987, and Italy raised the foreign currency requirement for export credit granted to foreign firms to 75 percent. Regulations on requirements for surrender of pro- ceeds from export activities were modified in several developing countries, mostly in the direction of increasing the percentage of proceeds permitted to be retained by exporters. Afghanistan and Colombia reduced the m in imum surrender required of exports proceeds. Egypt abolished surrender requirements for several private sector exports, and certain spe- cific private and public sector exports were trans- ferred from the commercial bank pool to the more depreciated new bank market rate. However, the transfer of balances in retention accounts to free accounts was prohibited; the use of 25 percent of the balances in the retention accounts was permitted for payments on some specified invisibles without prior authorization. In Mauritania exporters were authorized to retain 15 percent of proceeds to be applied to payments related to the same activity; in Tanzania the retention rate for all nontraditional exports was set at a maximum of 50 percent and at 30 percent in Sao Tome and Principe, to finance imports of specified capital goods and inputs. By contrast, early in the year the Dominican Republic introduced a requirement for the surrender of pro- ceeds from exports of sugar and mineral products and established a mandatory deposit requirement, and Sudan and Zambia required all exporters to surrender export proceeds to the central bank. Developing countries that took other measures related to exports in 1987 included Liberia, which required that exports of wood have at least 25 percent local processing content; Thailand, which adjusted the maximum value of each export trans- action allowed without approval to B 50,000; Ma- lays ia, wh ich pe rm i t ted export receipts to be ef- fected in any other currency except those of Israel and South Africa; and Honduras, which introduced a transferable certificate of foreign exchange (CENTRA). Among the fuel exporters, two countries took ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE EXCHANGE AND TRADE PRACTICES measures to liberalize surrender requirements; in Syria the 50 percent of export proceeds that ex- porters were authorized to retain was raised to 75 percent, and the extensive list of exporter categories was expanded; Venezuela relaxed the requirement to surrender export receipts, but eliminated the ability to effect exports in local currency. On the restrictive side, Ecuador and Syria both shortened the period for repatriation of export proceeds. Current Invisibles and Transfers Changes in regulations governing current invisi- bles resulted in a reduction of restrictions during 1987, continuing the trend that emerged in 1986. Most of the measures took the form of increased foreign exchange allocations for overseas travel, although several countries eased regulations on other invisible transactions allowing repatriation of profits and transfer of dividends and royalties. Only a few developing countries tightened current invis- ible transactions, mainly aiming to control capital flight. Limits on foreign currency acquired by residents traveling abroad were raised in three industrial countries (Iceland, Ireland, and Italy) and eliminated in France and Spain. Ireland also increased the maximum allowance that may be authorized by commercial banks without reference to the central bank. Ten developing countries relaxed regulations on foreign exchange allocations for travel (Cyprus, Greece, Guinea, Hungary, Israel, Korea, Lesotho, Morocco, Sri Lanka, and Turkey). In Korea the use of credit cards abroad was liberalized, and both Korea and Pakistan increased monthly allowances for students abroad and other miscellaneous trans- fers. Commercial banks were given extended au- thority to deal in foreign exchange in Turkey. India liberalized the scheme that permits exporters to use their foreign exchange holdings. By contrast, annual limits on gift remittances were tightened by Fiji, the per trip travel allowance was reduced by Fiji, Peru, and Suriname, and holiday travel allowances ceased to be granted in Zambia. Israel increased its foreign travel tax, but eliminated surcharges on purchases of t icke ts for t rave l ing abroad and increased ex- change allowances for family support, higher edu- cation, and gifts. Egypt introduced a limit of 25 percent on the proportion of retained export pro- ceeds that can be used freely to finance specified invisibles. Regulations governing the import and export of foreign and domestic currency notes and holdings of foreign currency were relaxed in two industrial countries. Italy raised the limits on exportation and liberalized the importation of bank notes by resi- dents and nonresidents; and Spain lifted restrictions on exports of foreign currency notes and traveler's checks. Among the group of developing countries, deposits to foreign currency accounts were eased in Colombia, and Egypt abolished the requirement that nonresidents must convert U.S. dollars at the commercial bank pool rate when entering the coun- t ry. Sri Lanka required foreigners, upon entering the country, to declare foreign exchange only in amounts greater than US$100 in currency notes or US$1,000 in monetary instruments. The amount of domestic currency notes travelers can take out or bring into Yugoslavia was increased. Regulations were tightened in Sierra Leone as holding of foreign exchange beyond the three-day limit was made illegal. Peru introduced a prior approval requirement by the central reserve bank on making payments for nonfinancial services abroad. Several measures were taken by developing coun- tries with regard to outward transfers or payments for services rendered by nonresidents, mostly in the direction of liberalizing existing regulations. Transfers of remittances abroad by expatriate work- ers were relaxed in Guinea, Jamaica, and Burundi; however, annual limits on remittances were set for expatriates on contract employment in Zambia. Foreign banks were allowed to repatriate their profits from Greece, but limits on remittances of dividends and profits to nonresidents were reduced in Zimbabwe, and remittances from Fiji of retained p ro f i ts a c cumu l a t ed in p r ev ious years were re- stricted. Dividends and royalties were permitted to be transferred in full in Guinea. Egypt transferred from the commercial bank pool to the new bank market specified public and private sector invisible payments and allowed Law 43 companies (joint ventures) to transfer profits abroad through the new bank market, provided that funds in their capital and working accounts had been fully utilized. The same provision applies to funds in export retention accounts for payments of public and private sector invisibles. The surrender requirement for proceeds from invisibles transactions introduced earlier in the year in the Dominican Republic was abolished. Other related measures included the gradual re- duction of a preferential exchange rate for payments of eligible debt in Chile; and in Guinea private individuals, upon the sale of gold to the central bank, are to be paid up to 50 percent in foreign exchange and in cash. A debt conversion scheme under which remit- 25 ©International Monetary Fund.

Interest pay- ments on official loans and debt accrued to nonres- ident commercial banks are subject to deposit at the central bank of Brazil. External Payments Arrears The Fund's data on members' external payments arrears include arrears that have been caused by exchange restrictions on current payments or trans- fers, as well as arrears on financial obligations of which the obligor is the government.10 The existence of arrears adversely affects the country's credit- worthiness, with the result that access to normal means of international financing is frequently cur- tailed. A further consequence is that the cost of international credit, as well as of imported goods and services, becomes higher than would otherwise be the case for most borrowers. In view of the particularly adverse consequences for the country maintaining arrears and for the international pay- ments system, the elimination or substantial reduc- tion of payments arrears in an orderly and nondis- criminatory manner constitutes an important element of members' economic programs supported by the use of the Fund 's resources.11 Moreover, the in- currence of arrears and policies of members giving rise to them have been subject to careful scrutiny in the context of Article IV consultations with the Fund. The Fund has also consistently followed the 10 Payments arrears evidence an exchange restriction under the Fund's Article VIII, Section 2(a), or Article X IV, Section 2, when the authorities of a country are responsible for undue delays in approving applications or in meeting bona fide requests for foreign exchange for current international transactions as defined in Article XXX (d). Accordingly, when a government, or a government entity whose financial operations form part of the budgetary process, fails to meet an external payments obligation, the resulting arrears are considered as evidence of defaults by the government rather than exchange restrictions. Similarly, arrears incurred by governments participating in a common central bank are treated as defaults. Although these distinctions are relevant for the purposes of Articles VIII and XIV, in the context of the Fund's policies on the uses of its resources, defaults and other forms of arrears involving current and capital payments are viewed as having the same broad macroeconomic character and consequences, and are therefore treated in the same manner. All references to payments arrears in this section relate to arrears as defined in the broadest sense. 11 A review of the implementation of Fund policies on mem- bers' external payments arrears was undertaken by the Executive Board in November 1986, the major conclusions of which were summarized in the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, 1987. The conclusions of earlier reviews of Fund policies were summarized in Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, 1983 and 1985. 26 practice of not approving under Article VIII, Section 2(a) of the Fund's Articles of Agreement exchange restrictions evidenced by arrears on current inter- national payments, except when a satisfactory pro- gram for the reduction or the elimination of arrears is in place. From a peak of SDR 44 billion recorded at the end of 1984, external payments arrears of Fund members are estimated to have declined by over SDR 7 billion in 1985 and increased again by about SDR 8 billion in 1986. Provisional data indicates that the amount of arrears decreased significantly in 1987, possibly by SDR 7 billion. The number of countries experiencing arrears fell to 56 at end-1987 from 58 the year before; this number had been rising continuously from 1976 to 1986 (lending emphasis to the difficulty of eliminating arrears once they have been incurred). Of the countries for which data are available, 25 experienced increases in existing arrears and 21 were able to reduce arrears. Arrears were eliminated in five countries (Afghan- istan, Cape Verde, Gabon, Jamaica, and Western Samoa); two countries (Bu rma and Panama) in- curred external arrears for the first time in 1987, and arrears re-emerged in one other country (Ecuador).12 The large reduction in the amount of arrears outstanding was mainly due to debt re- schedulings. Three countries (Brazil, Egypt, and Poland), which had one quarter of all outstanding arrears at the end of 1986, accounted for 90 percent of total reschedulings of arrears in 1987. Overall, 19 Fund member countries that had external pay- ment arrears concluded multilateral debt renegotia- tions with official and commercial creditors in 1987. At the end of 1987, 24 countries had adjustment programs suppor ted by s tand-by or extended ar- rangements in effect. Of these, 15 had external payments arrears at the time of program approval. Ten of the programs provided for an elimination of payments arrears in the first year, and the remaining five for a reduction during the program period, through a combination of rescheduling and cash payments. In two cases, a counterpart deposit 12 As of end-1987, the following Fund members maintained external payments arrears: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, Cote d'lvoire, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, The Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, St. Lucia, Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Suriname, Syrian Arab Republic, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Zaire, Zambia. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE EXCHANGE AND TRADE PRACTICES requirement in local currency was introduced as a means of providing more comprehensive informa- tion on arrears and of sterilizing the expansionary liquidity impact associated with the incurrence of external arrears. Multiple Currency Practices Article VIII, Section 3, of the Fund's Articles of Agreement prohibits a member from engaging in, or permitting its fiscal agencies to engage in, any discriminatory currency arrangements or multiple currency practice, except as authorized or approved by the Fund. Such practices may involve the exist- ence of separate exchange rates, the application of exchange rate taxes or subsidies, inadequate pay- ment of interest on advance import deposits and counterpart deposits against payments arrears, sig- nificant exchange rate spreads between buying and selling rates for spot transactions, and broken cross rates. The Fund approves multiple currency prac- tices only when a well-conceived plan is in place to bring about their elimination or substantial simpli- fication during a relatively short period of time. In many instances, the staff assists the authorities in formulating such a plan, usually in the context of adjustment programs supported by the use of Fund resources. The Executive Board most recently con- ducted a review of the Fund's experience and policies with respect to multiple exchange rate regimes in April 1984 and February 1985. The trend that emerged in 1985 toward reduced reliance on multiple currency practices continued through 1987. During 1987, 16 member countries either eliminated or simplified multiple currency practices, including cases where the coverage of transactions for market-determined/market-related exchange rates was expanded. Measures increasing the complexity of existing multiple currency prac- tices were introduced by five members, and two members reintroduced a multiple currency practice in 1987 after having eliminated it in 1986. Multiple currency practices were eliminated by four Fund members in the course of 1987. In Greece the non-interest-bearing advance deposit scheme for import payments introduced in November 1985 was abolished in May, following a substantial re- duction in deposit requirements under the scheme in February. In Sudan the official and the commer- cial bank exchange rates were unified in October, virtually unifying the exchange rate system as a whole with the exception of an accounting currency maintained for transactions under a bilateral pay- ments agreement. In Trinidad and Tobago the ex- change system was unified in January, as the pref- erential exchange rate applied since December 1985 to essential imports ceased to be applicable. In Zaire the official exchange rate was reunified, as of mid- April, with the exchange rate applied by the com- mercial banks, after a spread in excess of 2 percent be tween the official exchange rate and the com- mercial bank rate had arisen in October 1986. During 1987, 12 members made progress in either simplifying multiple currency practices or reducing the distortions associated with them, including the transfer of transactions to more market-related ex- change rates. In Argentina a more market-related exchange rate was introduced in November in ad- dition to the existing official rates to cover trans- actions previously effected in parallel markets. In Bangladesh the authorities reduced the spread be- tween the official and the secondary rates to within 5 percent by the end of 1987. In Brazil the financial transaction tax of 25 percent applying to purchase of foreign exchange for imports of goods and ser- vices was reduced to zero for specified import goods for the remainder of the year. In the Dominican Republic an exchange commission of 2 percent on the f .o .b. value was imposed in Janua ry on pur- chases and sales of foreign exchange for merchan- dise trade transactions, and the rate applied to merchandise imports was subsequently raised to 5 percent in June. In November the exchange com- mission applied to merchandise exports was elimi- nated, but the rate applied to merchandise imports was further increased to 20 percent. However, in February, the preferential exchange rate introduced in October 1986 and applied to public sector imports and debt service payments was abolished. Following a suspension of the free market float in June, a dual exchange market emerged temporarily, until, in November, a market-determined exchange rate was re-established, unifying the official and unofficial parallel exchange markets with the official rate set at the prevailing rate in the parallel markets. In Ghana the official exchange rates were unified in February, and after the unification, the scope of the auction market was broadened significantly, reducing the amount of foreign exchange being channeled into retention and other accounts held outside the official banking system. In Guinea the scope of the auction market was broadened in January, when all import and invisibles payments were made eligible to purchases of foreign exchange at the auction market, with the exception of certain limits applied to purchases for tourist travel and the transfer abroad of salaries by expatriate workers. 27 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS However, certain imports, including imports settled with foreign exchange obtained from sources outside the official market, continued to be effected outside the official market. An advance import deposit scheme for certain import payments introduced in January was discontinued in May. In Guyana a secondary foreign exchange w indow was estab- lished in February to operate with market-related exchange rates at commercial banks aimed at bring- ing parallel market transactions into the organized foreign exchange market, while special exchange rates applied previously to exports of rice and to exports of gold and diamonds were eliminated in January and September, respectively. In the Lao People's Democratic Republic the number of different exchange rates was reduced, in September, from seven to four. In Nigeria the official exchange rate was unified with the rate determined in the auction market, but a difference continued to exist between the exchange rate in the auction market for the sale of official receipts to authorized dealers and the exchange in the autonomous market for resale of these auctioned amounts and all other foreign exchange receipts and payments. In Peru a number of modifications were made to the exchange arrangements, involving a devaluation of the official exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, changes in the specified percentages of the official exchange rate that apply to various categories of exports, imports, service, and capital transactions, and changes in the coverage of the various categories of trans- actions that qualify to the different exchange rates. With these measures, the number of exchange rates applying to merchandise imports (including interest and commissions on financing) increased to six, and the number of rates for service payments and capital transactions was reduced from five to four. In Somalia the official market, the free market, and the auction market were unified in June through the extension of the auction market; a special exchange rate was maintained for petroleum im- ports. The foreign exchange auctions were discon- tinued in September and the exchange rate was pegged to the U.S. dollar in October. In Zambia a dual exchange system emerged with the reintro- duction of the auction market in March following its suspension in January, as the official exchange rate continued to apply to government procurement of medical and educational supplies and to the Bank of Zambia for external debt service and the proceeds from external loans and grants. The dual market was unified in May, when the exchange rate of the kwacha was pegged to the U.S. dollar. A modification in multiple currency practices 28 occurred in Egypt, where a phased process of unification of the commercial bank pool with a new bank market was underway in 1987. The new bank market rate was introduced in May, and by end- 1987 most transactions had been transferred from the commercial bank pool to the new bank market; all private sector imports and specified invisibles payments by the private sector were also permitted in this market. Five members increased the complexity of exist- ing multiple currency practices. In Bolivia an export subsidy scheme was introduced in Ju ly, under which exporters receive rebate certificates equivalent to 5 percent of the f.o.b. value of traditional exports and equivalent to 10 percent of the f.o.b. value of nontraditional exports. In Ecuador an advance im- port deposit scheme eliminated in August 1986 was reintroduced in October. In Nicaragua the propor- tion of foreign exchange proceeds from nontradi- tional agricultural exports eligible for surrender at the "free" exchange rate was raised from 25 percent to 50 percent. However, in June an exchange tax was imposed on imports of many nonessential con- sumer goods and nonagricultural capital goods as well as on certain spare parts and capital goods for agriculture. In Romania the spread between the exchange rates for commercial and noncommercial transactions widened as a result of an appreciation of the rate for noncommercial transactions. Two members that did not maintain a multiple currency practice at end-1986 introduced such a practice in 1987. In Ecuador the spread between the central bank intervention rate and the free market rate, which had been kept within a margin of less than 2 percent since August 1986, widened considerably since February 1987. In Grenada the tax on sales of foreign exchange applying to all sales of foreign exchange by commercial banks with the exception of sales for certain specified imports and remittances was raised to 5 percent in October; the rate had been reduced from 5 percent to 2 percent in February 1986, thus eliminating the feature characterizing it as a multiple currency practice. Bilateral Payments Arrangements and Countertrade Practices The 1987 Annual Report on Exchange Arrange- ments and Exchange Restrictions reported that, at the end of 1986, the total number of bilateral payments arrangements maintained between Fund members was 69, compared with 50 at the end of 1985, and that a total of 72 bilateral payments ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE EXCHANGE AND TRADE PRACTICES arrangements were maintained between Fund and non-Fund members, compared with 89 at the end of 1985.13 The Report pointed out that these changes in the number of bilateral payments arrangements during 1986 were primarily attributable to the acces- sion of Poland to membership in the Fund; excluding those involving Poland, the number of bilateral payments arrangements increased by three in 1986. Dur ing 1987 no Fund members concluded or ter- minated bilateral payments with other Fund mem- bers or non-Fund members, so that the total number of bilateral paymen ts agreements ma in ta ined be- tween Fund members and between Fund members and non-Fund members remained unchanged at 69 and 72, respectively. Detailed information on the value of trade con- ducted under bilateral payments arrangements is not available for most Fund members maintaining such arrangements. Since the value of trade between Fund membe rs m a in t a in ing b i la te ral p a ym e n ts agreements represents the maximum value of trade that could have been conducted under bilateral payments arrangements, the total value of such trade was much less than 1 percent of the total value of world trade of Fund members in 1987. In recent years, an increasing number of countries have resorted to trading practices known as coun- tertrade arrangements.14 These arrangements have taken a variety of forms, but basically they involve barter or quasi-barter arrangements between private firms and/or government entities, such as foreign trade organizations, under which the seller is obli- gated to accept specified goods or services from the buyer. Even though countertrade arrangements are for the most part carried out by private firms without official sanc t ion, a numb er of coun t r ies have re- cently announced guidelines to be followed by individual entities while engaging in countertrade or issued regulations making countertrade manda- tory for certain international transactions. The more common countertrade arrangements are known to have involved exchanges of crude oil for manufac- tured goods, including military equipment. 13 Bilateral payments arrangements maintained between Fund members give rise to restrictive exchange practices subject to Article VIII or Article XIV of the Fund's Articles of Agreement when they involve exchange restrictions or mu l t ip le currency practices. The jurisdictional implications of bilateral payments arrangements are summarized in Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, 1985, page 40. 14 In September 1982 the Executive Board reviewed the Fund's policy with respect to bilateral paymen ts and countertrade arrangements. The conclusion of that review were summarized in Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, 1983, pages 44-45. Available information on countertrade business in member countries is incomplete, especially in instances where official guidelines or regulations do not exist and thus a restriction as such is not involved. Among the industrial countries, Australia and Canada have passed legislation under which countertrade arrangements are mandatory for cer- tain defense-related procurements by the public sector. Developing countries that have engaged in countertrade arrangements involving mandatory off- set requirements for enterprises in the public sector include Indonesia, Israel, and Uruguay. A number of other developing countries, such as Argentina, Colombia, Egypt, Greece, Guyana, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jamaica, Malaysia, and Peru, have passed official legislation permitting public sector enterprises and/or private sector firms to engage in c o u n t e r t r a de a r r a n g em e n ts but not m a k i ng it mandatory. In many developing countries, private firms and/ or public sector entities have entered into counter- trade arrangements, although these types of arrange- ments have not been regulated. For instance, Al- ger ia, Bang lade sh, B raz i l, Ch i le, the People's Republic of China, Costa Rica, Ghana, Guinea, India, Iraq, Israel, Korea, Kuwait, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mexico, Nigeria, Pak is tan, Singapore, South Afr ica, Sudan, Suri- name, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, Ven- ezuela, Viet Nam, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have concluded countertrade arrangements with private firms in some of the countries within this group, as well as with those in the industrial countries and centrally planned Eastern European countries; the aim is to promote trade in p r ima ry products (in- cluding crude oil) and manufactured goods, and in some instances, to service external debt. Formal official requirements for private sector participation in countertrade giving rise to exchange or trade restrictions are known to exist in only one or two developing countries. However, informal require- ments, including administrative guidance and ad hoc conditions for issuance of import licenses, are reportedly widespread. Where countertrade prac- tices involve a direct governmental limitation on the use or availability of exchange as such, they entail exchange restrictions subject to the Fund's jurisdiction under Article VIII or Article XIV of the Fund's Articles of Agreement.15 15 Further discussion of the types and consequences of coun- tertrade practices which may entail exchange restrictions/mul- tiple currency practices may be found in Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, 1986, pages 33-34. 29 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS The emergence and growth of countertrade since the late 1970s may be attributed to several factors. Balance of payments difficulties and the scarcity of foreign exchange have led a number of developing countries to seek new financing techniques for trade and servicing of ex ternal debt. For example, ar- rangements have been made by Peru to service its foreign debt by using specified commodities. The pressures to find markets for surplus goods and the difficulties experienced in gaining access to the markets of the industrial countries for certain pri- mary and manufactured products have also prompted these countries to enter into countertrade arrange- ments that commit industrial country exporters to purchasing a given quantity of products over a specified period. In certain cases, countertrade in the form of buy-back arrangements is seen —by both industrial and the more advanced developing coun- tries —as a means of securing reliable sources of essential raw materials while exporting equipment and technology that have become outdated at home. Capital Controls A further liberalization of capital controls has been observed among industrial and developing countries during 1987. In industrial countries the modifications affected, inter alia, regulations gov- erning foreign currency working balances, long- term financial investments, personal transfers, and foreign borrowing. Some major restrictions still remain, however, in a number of industrialized countries. These include prohibitions of short-term investments in foreign currency or abroad, restric- tions on the transfer of funds across borders, limi- tations on the holding and exchange of foreign currencies, limitations of forward exchange trading, and requirements to repatriate foreign currency earnings from abroad. The liberalization of capital markets of European Economic Community (EEC) member countries envisaged by 1992 is expected to advance the process of eliminating remaining im- pediments to a free functioning of international capital markets as far as industrialized countries are concerned. In developing countries the experience with cap- ital controls was also, on balance, in favor of greater freedom. Liberalization occurred particularly in the areas of foreign currency accounts and investment capital flows. Measures affecting investment capital flows were in some instances related to the incor- poration of debt-equity conversion schemes in debt restructurings. Tightening affected mainly the trad- 30 ing and holding of foreign exchange by residents and capital outflows. Regulations concerning international transactions of commercial banks were changed in four industrial countries and Brazil. In Sweden all foreign exchange transac t ions were perm i t ted through authorized banks. In Spain limitations on banks' foreign cur- rency working balances were relaxed. Finland eased restrictions on foreign loans with maturities of five years or more. Japan granted limited access to financial fu tures trading abroad. And in Brazil the central bank established a short-term line of credit in foreign currency for domestic commercial banks. Regulations relating to domestic foreign currency accounts were eased in France and Poland, and in Brazil, El Salvador, the Philippines, and Zaire. In France and Sweden permission was also granted to nonbanks to maintain accounts abroad under certain conditions. Individual transfers and the use of blocked funds were liberalized in Ireland and Zimbabwe. Spain, on the other hand, prohibited payments of interest on some convertible peseta accounts; Peru prohibited the holding of foreign currency-denomi- nated bank balances; Bangladesh ordered conver- sion into local currency of interest accrued on some foreign currency accounts; and Egypt tightened restrictions on transfers between foreign currency accounts and took steps to close the previously illegal but officially tolerated nonbank foreign ex- change market by arresting a large number of street dealers. In Italy maximum holding periods for funds credited to foreign exchange accounts were reduced. In the area of portfolio inv e s tm en t, several in- dustrialized countries eased restrictions pertaining to the inflow and outflow of capital. France, Spain, and Sweden allowed easier access to foreign bor- rowing by residents. Norway permitted foreigners to purchase domestic bonds, and Italy and Ireland relaxed restrictions on portfolio investments abroad by residents. Spain permitted some international organizations to borrow in the domestic capital market, but tightened rules regarding investments in domestic short-term titles by nonresidents. Among the developing countries, Greece expanded the right for residential companies to borrow abroad, and Malaysia expanded the rights of residents to borrow in foreign currencies and relaxed restrictions on domestic borrowing by foreigners, whereas Fiji suspended overseas investments and other forms of capital exports by residents. Foreign direct investment by nonresidents was encouraged in a number of developing countries that relaxed corresponding regulations or offered special incentives. Six countries (Argentina, Brazil, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN REGIONAL ARRANGEMENTS Chile, Jamaica, the Philippines, and Venezuela) introduced or extended debt-equity conversion pro- grams, and Zambia introduced a similar program aimed specifically at the reduction of external payment arrears. From a regulatory point of view, these programs do not always constitute a liberalization of capital controls. Countries tend to give incentives for direct investments under debt-equity swap schemes; they may also waive some specific regulations other- wise applied to such investment. On the other hand, most of these schemes are burdened with a host of restrictions that are more stringent than those applying to other foreign direct investment in the same country. They limit particularly the nature of investments permitted, profit remittances, and capital repatriation. Korea engaged in a substantial program of liberali- zation by opening manufacturing sectors to foreign investment, raising limits on overseas investment exemp ted from prior gove rnmen tal approval and screening, reducing tax privileges for foreign com- panies and relaxing after-investment controls, and easing restrictions on the purchase of foreign real estate by Korean companies. Other actions affecting direct investment by non- residents or investment abroad by residents include Spain's liberalization of investments abroad by res- idents and direct investments in the domestic market by nonresidents. Sweden liberalized residents' pur- chases of property abroad. By contrast, Australia subjected real estate investment by nonresidents to approval, and Norway prohibited the granting of loans, credits, or guarantees to and investments in South Africa and Namibia. Ecuador simplified the regulations governing foreign direct investment and, in August, suspended temporarily the debt-equity conversion scheme that had been introduced at the end of 1986. Fiji tightened controls on outward capital flows, whereas Korea liberalized such trans- actions. Peru introduced an exchange premium for the conversion of private foreign capital into local currency for direct investment in specified sectors. Gold Continuing the trend of recent years, very few countries introduced changes in regulations affect- ing transactions in gold. Colombia modified the formula applied to calculate the price paid for gold purchases to include a 3 percent premium to com- pensate miners for costs incurred by taxes instituted in 1986. Suriname reduced the purchase price for locally produced gold by one third, and Costa Rica authorized the sale of unrefined gold by the Central Bank. IV. Main Developments in Regional Arrangements Foreign Ministers from the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)16 and the European Communities (EC)17 held their annual meeting in Singapore on June 18-20. The meeting discussed the regional view of negotiations w i th in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the Un i ted Na t ions Conference on Trade and Devel- opment (UNCTAD). Issues included a proposed EC oils and fats tax and intellectual property rights. Other topics discussed were inves tment promotion between EC and ASEAN enterprises, progress made in the establishment of joint investment com- mittees in ASEAN capitals, and projects in human resources development, science and technology, and indus try. Heads of government from the six countries forming ASEAN met in December for the first time in ten years. Economic cooperation with a view to increasing the quantity and quality of intra-ASEAN trade was the central theme of discussion. During a special press conference given in Mos- cow on May 18, the Secretary of the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA)18 called for the establishment of official relations between the EC and CMEA. Establishment of an EC delegation in Oslo was approved by the European Commission, and prog- ress in various areas of cooperation between the EC and the Eu ropean Free Trade Assoc ia t ion (EFTA)19 since the two parties signed their Free Trade Agreement was reviewed at the annual high- level meeting in Oslo on June 1-2. An update on 16 Members of ASEAN are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. 17 EC membership comprises Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxem- bourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. 18 CMEA membership comprises Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslo- vakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam. 19 EFTA membership comprises Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. 31 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS progress made toward completion of the EC's in- ternal market, including a plan for reform, was also presented at that meeting, and there was a review of EC-EFTA relations since the Luxembourg dec- laration of political cooperation of 1984. The first two conventions of that declaration were signed by the EC and EFTA on May 20, indicating progress toward the creation of a single European economic and free trade zone. The conventions are designed to facilitate EC-EFTA and intra-EFTA trade by harmonizing customs documentation and transit procedures. The first convention creates a single administrative document for trade in goods, and the second provides for a common procedure for transit of goods for EC-EFTA trade and intra-EFTA trade. At the same meeting, agreement was reached on the need for further cooperation in dealing with counterfeit trade, indirect taxation, liberalization of capital movements, and the maintenance of a regular dialogue in the financial services sector. It was also agreed that transparency should be the first step in cooperation regarding liberalizing public procure- ment policies. On trade in goods, it was established that negotiations should take place on the elimina- tion of quan t i ta t ive export res tr ic t ions. The im- provement of rules for trade in processed agricul- tural products within the context of the Free Trade Agreements reached between the EC and the indi- vidual EFTA countries, notably to increase their transparency, was also considered as a subject for possible cooperation. The European Commission published a commu- nication to the European Parliament in February outlining the requirements for an integrated internal market by 1992. Reference was also made to the need for reforms in the sectors of a common agri- cultural policy, Community structural fund s, and the development of stable and guaranteed financial resources. Spain and Portugal's accession to the EC and the consequences for the Lome Convention was the main topic on the agenda for the Council meeting between the EC and the African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP)20 States on May 14-15 in Brussels. 20 The 66 ACP states associated with the EC are divided into the following categories by Lome III: (1) the least-developed countries —Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burund i, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Djibouti, Dominica, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Grenada, Guinea, Guinea- Bissau, Kiribati, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, St. Lucia, Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, and Western Samoa; (2) the island and landlocked countries —Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Jamaica, Mada- 32 Other items on the agenda were financial, technical, customs, and trade cooperation, agricultural com- modities, and the implementation of Lome III. The Ministers also discussed preparations for the sev- enth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD 7), which took place in Geneva from July 9 to 31, 1987. The follow-up to the UN special session devoted to Africa's critical social and economic situation was also discussed. Another topic was the conclusion of Spain and Portugal's Accession Protocol to the Third Lome Convention; transitional arrangements providing for the application of Lome III to both countries and the definition of rules governing trade between ACP countries and Spain and Portugal expired on June 30. The Economic Community of West African States (EcowAS)21 held its tenth summit in Abuja, Nigeria. The ECOWAS Economic Recovery Program (ERP), launched at a special session of the summit, allocates funds to approved projects, most of which are regional in scope. The necessity to implement trade liberalization was addressed, and progress in de- veloping transport and communications infrastruc- tures, as well as the promotion of free movement of persons, goods, and services, was noted. A program calling for the creation of a common cur- rency was endorsed at the meeting. The plan pro- poses the creation of a full monetary zone with convertible currency and pooled reserves, following a five-year transitional period. Antigua and Barbuda and Botswana acceded to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in April and Augus t, respectively, and Morocco became the ninety-fourth Contracting Party, with effect from June 17. Algeria, which is de facto a member of the GATT, has also announced its intention to become a Contracting Party. Heads of state and government of the six member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) held their eighth annual summit in Riyadh in De- cember.

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)- UN-GATT Economic Consultative Committee met on March 23-24, 1987 in Paris. Topics discussed included macroeconomic policy coordination among the industrial countries and structural adjustment and the restoration of cred i twor th iness in the in- debted developing countries. On December 10, 1986 Argentina and Brazil, acting within the framework of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA),22 signed an agree- ment liberalizing the exchange of capital goods be tween the two coun tr ies. The agreement pre- serves preferential treatment between the signato- ries, expands the category of capital goods already included in exchange liberalization agreements, and provides for a system of consultations between the two countries prior to the granting of tariff exemp- tions for imports of capital goods included in the so-called common list. On December 21, 1987, the Third Biennial Report by Australia and New Zealand on the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Agreement (SPAR- TEC A)23 was submitted to the GATT. SPARTECA provides duty-free and unrestricted access to the Australian and New Zealand markets for most products exported by the Forum Island Countries. Australia and New Zealand provide these conces- sions on a nonreciprocal basis. The South Pacific Bureau for Economic Cooperation is responsible for overseeing the operation of SPARTECA, and an annual review of the agreement is held at the Regional Committee on Trade meeting. The Organization of American States (OAS)24 held the Fourth Policy, Programming, and Coordi- nation Meeting for the Caribbean Subregion and Suriname from April 29 to May 3, 1987, in Basse- terre, St. Kitts and Nevis. The meeting dealt with current development needs of the states of the region, the policies, mechanisms, and problems appropriate to their development, and the comple- tion of the programming process for the countries for the 1988-89 biennium. The Organization of Africa Un i ty (OAU)25 held its summit in Addis Ababa in Ju ly. Participants reiterated that an international conference was the most appropriate means for international creditors and African borrowers to seek a solution to the problem of debt repayment. In preparation for such a conference, the permanent steering committee was given the task of formulating concrete proposals for a solution and for a common African position on the issue. Other proposals included the imposi- tion of various sanctions against South Africa in the areas of commercial, academic, and cu l tural ex- change. An extraordinary economic summit took place in Addis Ababa from November 30 to Decem- ber 1, 1987 to devise a common strategy on debt. The OAU and the Economic Commission for Africa held a conference in Abuja, Nigeria in June to appraise the progress in the implementation of the UN Program of Action for the African Priority Program for Economic Recovery (APPER), which was adopted at the UN Special Session in New York on June 1, 1986. African states were encour- aged to reform and liberalize their economies and so attract new aid and investment. The South African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC)26 group held its seventh an- nual summit in Botswana in February.

A financial exchange market rate was introduced, which is allowed to fluctuate freely; in effect, this rate replaces illegal parallel exchange rate. Transactions at fixed official exchange rate include all trade-related current and capital transactions, all public sector transactions, all disbursements from international organizations, amortization and refinancing of private sector loans disbursed prior to 10/9/87, and servicing of debt contracted through official exchange market. Transactions in free market include travel and tourism, other non-trade-related nonfinancial services of private sector, direct investment, and private borrowing without public guarantee. Spread between fixed and free exchange rates averaged about 20 percent from mid- October to end-December.4 Peso devalued by 58.6 percent in terms of the U.S. dollar to eliminate gap between official and parallel markets. Reference basket for determination of exchange rate of the krona changed: bilateral trade weights replaced by weights of individual currencies in exchange transactions (buying and selling). This change resulted in an increase of weight of the U.S. dollar in reference basket from about 29.9 percent to about 55.4 percent. Reinstatement of reference basket based on bilateral trade weights, replacing basket based on weights of individual currencies in exchange transactions; resulted in a reduction of weight of the U.S. dollar in basket from 55.4 percent to 29.9 percent. Dual exchange market un if ied, exchange rate to be determined by auctions. Despite unification, a difference exists between exchange rate in auction market for sale of official receipts to authorized dealers, and exchange rate in autonomous market for resale of these auctioned amounts and all other foreign exchange receipts and paymen ts.

Not for Redistribution This page intentionally left blank ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PART TWO ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution This page intentionally left blank ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two Part Two gives a detailed description of the exchange and trade system of individual member countries, includ- ing a nonmetropolitan territory (Hong Kong), for which the United Kingdom has accepted the Fund's Articles of Agreement, and the Netherlands Antilles, which is a part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The exchange and trade system of one other country, which is not a member of the Fund, is also described. In general, the description relates to the exchange and trade systems as at the end of 1987, but in appropriate cases reference is made to significant developments that took place early in 1988. A standardized approach has been followed, under which the description of each system is broken down into similar headings, and the coverage for each country includes a final section that lists chronologically the more significant changes during 1987. The description of the restrictive system is not neces- sarily confined to those aspects involving exchange re- strictions or exchange controls. As in previous Reports, questions of definition and jurisdiction have not been raised, and an attempt has been made to describe restric- tive systems in their entirety, except for the tariff structure and, in most cases, direct taxes on exports and imports. Thus, the coverage extends to such features as import licensing, advance deposit requ iremen ts, import sur- charges, travel taxes, export licensing, and export incen- tive schemes. Similarly, the section "Changes During 1987" includes references to certain developments that may have a direct impact on international transactions but are not necessarily reflected in the body of the country descriptions, such as major revisions of import tariffs or developments in regional cooperation. The description given in the section Exchange Arrange- ment is in line with the notification of exchange arrange- ments that member countries have furnished to the Fund under Article IV, Section 2(0). The structure of exchange markets is described, and the official exchange rate is given. The rates quoted are those effective on December 31, 1987, unless stated otherwise. Under Administration of Control, some indication is given of the authorities responsible for policy and admin- istration of the controls and of the extent to which their powers are delegated for working purposes. The section on Prescription of Currency describes the requirements affecting the selection of the currency and method of settlement for transactions with other coun- tries. Where a country has concluded payments agree- ments with other countries, the terms of these agreements often lead to prescription of the currency for specified categories of payments to and from the countries con- cerned. The countries with which bilateral paymen ts agreements are in force are listed either in the text or in a footnote. Under Nonresident Accounts, a description is given of the manner in which the country treats accounts, if any, maintained in its currency by account holders who are not regarded as resident in that country, and the facilities and limitations attached to such accounts. Where there is more than one type of nonresident account, the nature and operation of the various types are also described. In the section on Imports and Import Payments, import licensing requirements are described briefly, and details are given of other requirements imposed on payments for imports and of any advance deposit requirements. The term "open general license" indicates arrangements whereby certain imports or other international transac- tions are exempt from the restrictive application of licen- sing requirements, in contrast to an "individual license," wh ich may be given either f ree ly, or restrictively, ac- cording to administrative decisions. Under Payments for Invisibles, the procedures for permitting payments abroad for current transactions in invisibles are described briefly, together with any limi- tations on the export of foreign and domestic bank notes. For some countries that do not impose limitations on payments for invisibles, this section is combined with the section on Proceeds from Invisibles (see below). Export licensing requirements and procedures are de- scribed under Exports and Export Proceeds, with an outline of the requirements that may be imposed on the handling of proceeds from exports. The expression "ex- change receipts must be surrendered" indicates that the recipient is required by the regulations to sell any foreign exchange proceeds in return for local currency, usually at the official rate, to the central bank or to a commercial bank or exchange dealer authorized for this purpose. In some countries there is a requirement that such exchange or part thereof be sold in a free market. Under Proceeds from Invisibles, any regulations gov- erning exchange derived from transactions in invisibles are given, and any limitations on the import of foreign and domestic bank notes are described. The coverage under Capital describes the special ar- rangements or limitations attached to international capital movements. Where regulations on foreign capital also cover the income thereon, they are usually dealt with in this section rather than in the sections on Payments for Invisibles and Proceeds from Invisibles. The section on Gold gives a summary of the principal regulations that govern the holding, negotiation, import, and export of gold coin and gold in other forms. In this Report, references to "Taiwan" are to Taiwan Province of China. 61 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution This page intentionally left blank ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AFGHANISTAN (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Afghanistan is the Afghani. Da Af- ghanistan Bank (the central bank) maintains an official rate which is applied to (1) transactions of the Central Government; (2) certain foreign currency income earned in Afghanistan (see section on Proceeds from Invisibles, below); and (3) all transactions in accounting units spec- ified under bilateral paymen ts agreements. The official exchange rate is defined in terms of the U.S. dollar and is flexible. On December 31, 1987 the official exchange rate was Af 50.00 - US$1 buy ing and Af 51.20 = US$1 selling, respectively. Aside from the official rate, there are several mixed rates that apply to certain export transactions, a market- determined rate that prevails in the money-bazaar, and a rate set by commercial banks that is informally linked to the money-bazaar rates. On December 31, 1987 the money-bazaar rate was Af 197.63 = US$1 and the commercial bank rate was Af 175.00 = US$1. There are surrender requirements for a number of exports, and mixed rates result from the rates of surrender requirements, as follows. For medical roots, other medical products, raisins, and skins (except karakul), exporters are required to surrender 10 percent of the foreign exchange proceeds to Da Afghanistan Bank. For patl wool, licorice, and other wools, the surrender require- ments are 15 percent, 20 percent, and 30 percent, re- spectively. For all these products one half of the amount to be surrendered is converted at the rate of Af 50.00 = US$1, and one half at the rate of Af 100.00 = US$1, or at an average rate of Af 75.00 = US$1. The remaining foreign exchange proceeds may be used for imports, converted at the money-bazaar rate, deposited in an account with a commercial bank, or retained in an account abroad for a period not to exceed 8, 10, or 12 months, depending on the country. For karakul skins, exporters are required to surrender 100 percent of the proceeds, of which 45 percent is converted at the official rate, and 55 percent, at the commercial bank rate. Cotton may only be exported by four approved state enterprises, which pay the producer Af 158 per kilogram. Da Afghanistan Bank posts rates for deutsche mark, French francs, Indian rupees, Pakistan rupees, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs. Da Afghanistan Bank charges commissions ranging from 0.10 percent to 0.375 percent on exchange transactions. Administration of Control Foreign exchange transactions are controlled by the Government through Da Afghanistan Bank. The control is facilitated by the existence of relatively large companies specializing in the export of such commodities as karakul, cotton, wool, and carpets. However, these companies do not exercise a monopoly over the export of such com- modities, except for cotton, which can only be exported by four authorized companies. Prescription of Currency Settlements with countries with which Afghanistan has bilateral payments agreements1 must be made in bilateral accounting dollars in accordance with the procedures set forth in those agreements. The proceeds from exports of karakul to all countries must be obtained in convertible currencies. There are no other prescription of currency requirements. Imports and Import Payments Imports are not subject to license, but import trans- actions must be registered before orders are placed abroad. Imports of a few items (e.g., some drugs, liquor, arms, and ammunition) are prohibited on grounds of public policy or for security reasons; in some instances, however, special permission to import these goods may be granted. The importation of certain other goods (e.g., a few textiles and selected nonessential consumer goods) is also prohibited. There are no quantitative restrictions on other imports. Most bilateral agreements, however, specify quantities (and sometimes prices) for commodities to be traded. An annual import program is drawn up by the Ministry of Commerce, covering imports of both the public and private sectors. Adjustments in the public sector import plan are made in the light of changing circumstances. The import plan for the private sector, drawn up on the basis of proposals submitted by the Chamber of Commerce, is indicative. Importation of petroleum products and sugar is a state monopoly. The present customs tariff structure was promulgated in June 1974 and has since then been modified in the annual budgets. Actual tariff rates, ad valorem and spe- cific, vary considerably. Ad valorem duties usually range between 20 percent and 35 percent. Payments for imports through the banking system to payments agreement countries may usually be made only under letters of credit. Payments to other countries may be made under letters of credit, against bills for collection, or against an undertaking by the importer to import goods at least equivalent to the payment made through the banking system. Except for public sector imports under the government budget, all importers are required to lodge minimum import deposits with banks at the time of opening letters of credit; the deposit ratios, based on the c.i.f. value of imports, range from 25 percent for essentials to up to 45 percent for other imports. 1 People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, German Democratic Republic, and U.S.S.R. 63 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AFGHANISTAN Payments for Invisibles Tourists are permitted to take out up to US$2,000 or the equivalent in other foreign currencies, and traders can take out up to US$15,000 for imports of goods. When foreign travel is for other purposes, the permissible amounts are determined by the appropriate authorities in each case. Permission from the central bank or one of the commercial banks is necessary for taking out foreign currency. Exchange for private travel, as for other private purposes, has to be acquired in the bazaar market. The fee for a passport valid for one year is Af 20,000 for tourist travel and Af 1,000 to Af 2,500 for other types of travel. Travelers are not allowed to take out more than Af 2,000 in domestic bank notes and Af 50 in coins. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports (other than gold) are not subject to license, but export transactions must be registered. Exports of a few commodities (e.g., opium and museum pieces) are prohibited. Otherwise, control is exercised only over exports to bilateral agreement countries (see section on Imports and Import Payments, above). Proceeds from exports of karakul to all countries, including payments agreement countries, must be received in convertible currencies. Receipts from exports of natural gas, karakul, cotton, and wool are subject to 100 percent surrender requirements. Receipts from medical roots, other medical products, raisins, skins (except karakul), and licorice are subject to surrender requirements ranging from 10-30 percent. Export proceeds from these products are con- verted at various exchange rates (see section on Exchange Arrangement, above). In the case of trade under bilateral payments agree- ments, export proceeds may be retained in bilateral clearing dollar accounts with Da Afghanistan Bank. These retained proceeds may either be used directly by the original exporter or sold to other importers. In either case, the retained proceeds are converted at the basic official rate of Af 50 = US$1. In the case of exports to countries trading in convertible currencies, export pro- ceeds may be retained abroad for 8, 10, or 12 months, depending on the country of destination. During the period the funds are held abroad, the exporter may use them for import of any goods other than those included in the list of prohibited goods. Alternatively, the exporter may sell the proceeds to an importer who may use them to purchase abroad from a list of 33 specified items. At the end of the periods indicated above, the foreign exchange holdings abroad have to be repatriated to a non-interest-bearing foreign currency account with a bank in Afghan is tan. After this transfer, the retained proceeds may be used by the exporter or sold to another importer only for impor- tation from the list of 33 specified commodities referred to above. In all cases, sale of retained proceeds to other importers takes place at the commercial bank rate. Proceeds front Invisibles Sixty percent of the foreign currency salaries of foreign employees working in the Afghan public and private 64 sectors and 40 percent of the foreign currency salaries of foreign experts and advisors paid from grants under aid programs must be converted into Afghanis at the official rate. Travelers entering Afghanistan are required to spend a m in imum of the equivalent of US$26 per day in foreign exchange. They may bring in any amount of foreign currency but must declare it when entering the country if they intend to take out any residue when leaving the country, subject to the above m in imum conversion re- quirement. Travelers may bring in no more than Af 2,000 in Afghan banknotes and Af 50 in Afghan coins. Capital Foreign inves tment in Afghanistan requires prior ap- proval and is administered by an Inves tment Committee. The Foreign and Domestic Private Investment Law of 1353 (issued on July 4, 1974) provides for a number of benefits, which include (1) income tax exemption for four years (six years outside Kabul province), beginning from the date of the first sales of products resulting from the new inves tmen t; (2) exemption from import duties on essential imports (mainly of capital goods); (3) exemption from taxes on dividends for four years after the first distribution of dividends, but not more than seven years after the approval of the inves tmen t; (4) exemption from personal income and corporate taxes on interest on foreign loans which constitute part of an approved inves tmen t; (5) exemption from export duties, provided that the products are permitted to be exported; and (6) mandatory purchases by government agencies and departments of their requirements from enterprises established under the law where prices of such products are not more than 15 percent higher than prices of foreign supplies. The law provides that foreign investment in Afghanistan can only take place through jo int ven tures, with foreign partici- pation not exceeding 49 percent. It also establishes that an inves tment approved by the Investment Committee shall require no fur ther license in order to operate in Afghanistan. Payments of principal and interest on loans from abroad may be remitted freely to the extent of the legal obligation involved. Profits may be repatriated freely, and capital may be repatriated after five years at an annual rate not exceeding 20 percent of the total registered capital. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell domes- tically gold in any form. Imports of gold are restricted. Exports of gold bullion and silver, as well as of jewelry, require permission of Da Afghanistan Bank and the Ministry of Finance. Commercial exports of gold and silver jewelry and of other articles containing minor quantities of gold or silver do not require a license and may be made freely. Customs duties are payable on imports and exports of silver in any form unless the import or export is made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AFGHANISTAN Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 1. A new commercial bank rate was introduced. This rate is linked informally to the money-bazaar rate, and is applied to convert all proceeds from exports outside bilateral trading arrangements. Prescription of Currency June 7. A bilateral trade agreement was concluded with Iraq. Exports and Export Proceeds January 1. The surrender requirements for export proceeds were modified, as follows: (1) the surrender rate for wool was lowered from 100 percent to 15 percent for patl wool and 30 percent for other wool; (2) medical roots, other medical products, raisins, and skins of animals other than karakul were subject to a 10 percent surrender requirement; and (3) licorice was subject to a surrender requirement of 20 percent. 65 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ALGERIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Algeria is the Algerian Dinar. Daily buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the interven- tion currency, and other specified currencies1 are estab- lished by the Central Bank of Algeria on the basis of a fixed relationship between the dinar and a composite of currencies. The currencies included in the composite and their weights take into account the relative importance of payments, including capital transactions, that are made in these currencies. A margin of DA 0.015 has been established between the buying and selling rates of the dinar in terms of the U.S. dollar. An encouragement premium is granted on the conversion of convertible currencies repatriated by Algerians working abroad. This premium is payable regardless of the freely convertible currency presented and is equal to the difference between the prevailing French franc/Algerian dinar daily rate and the fixed rate of F 1 = DA 1. On each trip to Algeria, Algerians gainfully employed abroad are required to exchange an amount of convertible currency equivalent to DA 700 at the exchange rate operative on the day the transaction takes place. They receive the incentive pre- mium only on those conversions or transfers that are not required by law or regulation. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were DA 4.9346 = US$1 and DA 4.9442 = US$1, respectively. The foreign exchange reserves are centralized in the Central Bank; authorized banks must clear their foreign currency position with their foreign correspondents at the end of each day but, under certain conditions, they are permitted to hold cover for documentary credits outside Algeria. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk. Administration of Control The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have general jurisdiction over exchange control. The Central Bank assists in the formulation of the exchange legislation and regulations and is responsible for their application by the authorized banks. Authority over many exchange control procedures has been delegated to five commercial banks and the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses and global import quotas are issued by the Ministry of Commerce within the limits of a general import program. Import and export licenses require the visa of the Central Bank. Investment of foreign capital in excess of DA 500,000 in Algeria requires approval by a National Investment Committee in order to obtain the benefits of the Investment Code. 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, Nor- wegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 66 Prescription of Currency Settlements with countries with which no payments agreements are in force are made in convertible curren- cies.2 Payments under foreign supply contracts (contrats de fournitures} can be made in either the currency in use at the headquarters of the supplier or that of the country of origin of the merchandise. Foreign holders of servicing contracts are required to open local nonresident accounts to which payments are made by the Algerian contracting party; such accounts must be closed within six months from the end of the contract, beyond which date outward transfers of the funds or their use for purposes unrelated to the contracts are not permitted. Nonresident Accounts Most nonresident accounts are Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars or Internal Nonresident Accounts. There are at present four types of accounts, as follows: 1. Individual Suspense Accounts may be opened with- out authorization and may be credited with payments from any country. Balances in such accounts opened prior to January 1, 1975 by nonresident physical persons of foreign nationality have been released for transfer abroad. 2. Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars (CEDAC accounts) may be opened by individuals or juridical persons of foreign nationality, including those under supply or servicing contract arrangements. Such accounts may be credited only with deposits that, under the regulations applicable when the deposit is made, are free from any restrictions on transfer. They may not be credited with amounts that are transferable to the bilateral area. They may be debited for payments to any foreign country, for payments in Algeria, or for the provision of foreign bank notes that the account holder intends to export when he travels abroad. These accounts bear interest and may not show a net debt position. 3. Final Departure Accounts may be opened, without prior authorization, in the name of any physical person residing in Algeria, not of Algerian nationality, who intends to leave Algeria to return to the country of origin. These accounts may be credited freely with an amount equivalent to the holdings on October 20, 1963 in the account of the person concerned; with the proceeds from sales of real estate of the account holder, provided that the funds are paid directly by a notary public; with the proceeds of the sale of securities through a bank; and with any other payments, up to DA 2,000. These accounts may be debited without prior approval for certain pay- ments in Algeria on behalf of the account holder. Outward transfers require individual approval. 2 Specified noncommercial settlements with Morocco and Tunisia are channeled through a dirham account at the Bank of Morocco, and an account in Tunisian dinars, at the Central Bank of Tunisia. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Emigrant workers may maintain certain accounts in Algeria that are credited with the proceeds from the conversion of convertible currencies (comptes epargne- devises). Depositors receive an incentive premium equiv-. alent to 40 percent of the buying exchange rate on the conversion date of such foreign exchange. 4. Foreign Currency Accounts are held by physical or juridical Algerian nationals resident in Algeria, Algerian nationals who are nonresidents, or Algerian nationals who have resided for more than six months in a foreign country. Such accounts may be freely credited with (1) book transfers from abroad using either postal or banking facilities, (2) imported convertible foreign currencies that have been declared at the account holder's entry into the country, and (3) domestic bank-to-bank book transfers. The accounts may be freely debited for book transfers abroad but only through the banking system; they may also be debited for purchases of dinars, for book transfers in dinars, and for purchases of convertible foreign cur- rencies to be physically exported by the account holder. A conversion premium is received on any amount drawn and used for payment of expenses in the country, with the exception of legal payment obligations. The interest rate payable on deposits in these accounts is fixed annually by the Minister of Finance. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Certain imports are prohibited regardless of origin. Law No. 78-02 of February 11, 1978 gives the Government a monopoly over foreign trade. All imports are permitted, in principle, in accordance with an annual import program. This is implemented mainly through global import au- thorizations (automations globales a" importation, or AGIs) granted to public enterprises. There are five types of import authorizations: (1) AGI Monopole, issued to en- terprises holding monopoly rights to import specified commodities; (2) AGI de fonctionnement interne, issued to individual enterprises for import requirements relating to their production activity; (3) AGI objectif planifie, issued to enterprises for imports relating to their invest- ment program; (4) AGI (sans paiement), under which exemption from all exchange control formalities is granted to transactions not involving use of official foreign ex- change or local currency or any other counterparts. (Since 1987 it has been possible to open foreign currency ac- counts without prior authorization in the name of any physical person of Algerian nationality resident in Algeria. The rules for operating such accounts and the rates of interest payable on assets held in these accounts are the same as for foreign currency accounts opened by persons of Algerian nationality who are nonresidents or who have been resident abroad for more than six months); and (5) AGI (sans transfer), issued to enterprises for specified import products (classified as consumable products— matieres consommables) utilized in public works con- tracts; simplified exchange and trade control formalities are applied to such transactions. ALGERIA Special regulations apply to imports of a noncommercial character, and for imports without payment of new equipment not destined for resale, as well as to auto- mobiles for personal use. Imports not destined for resale may be made free of exchange and trade controls up to a value of DA 10,000. New equipment goods can also be imported without use of official exchange and free of exchange and trade control formalities, provided that (1) the value in each case does not exceed DA 200,000, and (2) the goods are not for resale; the list of goods that can be thus imported is established from time to time by ministerial decree. Domestic residents can obtain an authorization to import an automobile for personal use, without use of official exchange and free of exchange and trade control formalities. All imports must be domiciled with an authorized bank, to which the necessary import documents must be pre- sented and through which all payments related to the transaction must be made. Without a waiver from the exchange control authority (the Ministry of Finance or the Central Bank), advance payments may not exceed 15 percent of the import value. In accordance with Law No. 80-07 of August 3, 1980, imports must be insured domestically. In the case of urgent or exceptional import expenditures by public agencies, public enterprises, and ministerial departments, the domiciliary banks for the import payments may effect payment before completion of the trade and exchange control formalities. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles to all countries require the approval of the Central Bank. When supporting docu- ments are presented, however, approval may be granted by authorized banks, or sometimes by the Postal Admin- istration, either freely or up to specified limits for certain payments, such as (1) those relating to approved trade transactions and maritime contracts, (2) travel expenses, (3) transfers of salaries and wages, (4) educational ex- penses, and (5) advertising expenses. For payments for which the approval authority has not been delegated, the granting of exchange must be authorized by either the Central Bank or the Ministry of Finance. Certain public enterprises, which receive special exchange allocations (budget devises), may use these freely for payments for specified invisibles, including transportation and other services contracted abroad. The transfer of family remit- tances is suspended. Insurance on all risks arranged in Algeria by Algerian residents must be purchased in Algeria. Private national exporters may open EDAC accounts (i.e., exporters' Convertible Dirham Accounts) denominated in convertible dinars, which can be credited with up to 4 percent of repatriated proceeds and be used for any of the following payments: business travel allow- ances; air travel expenditures; salaries and expenditures of foreign technicians; imports of essential spare parts and capital goods amounting to less than DA 200,000; representations at overseas trade fairs and exhibitions; and legal and administrative expenses. 67 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ALGERIA Residents of other countries working in Algeria under the programs for technical cooperation or for public enterprises and agencies or for certain mixed companies may transfer abroad a percentage of their net salaries, as follows: 50 percent for single persons and married persons whose families are in Algeria; and 70 percent for persons whose families are abroad. For other workers who have contracts with other employers and hold the necessary employment documents, the amounts that may be trans- ferred are 35 percent for single persons and married persons whose families are in Algeria and 55 percent for persons whose families are abroad. The payments must be transferred once a month on the basis of the remu- neration for the previous month. Persons making such transfers are not entitled to allocations for other personal transfers. For resident nationals and individuals of foreign na- tionality having resident status (excluding those having an entitlement to make transfers) traveling by air or sea to foreign countries, including countries in the French Franc Area, for purposes other than medical treatment, the foreign exchange allocation is the equivalent of DA 1,000 every four calendar years for a person over 18 years of age and is provided on presentation of a valid passport and travel vouchers; the same allocation is granted for overland travel. Residents requiring medical treatment abroad receive a foreign exchange allowance equal to DA 800 if the patient is over 15 years and DA 400 if the patient is under 15 years. On each trip to Algeria, Algerians gainfully employed abroad are required to exchange an amount of convertible currency equivalent to DA 700 at the exchange rate operative on the day the transaction takes place. They receive the incentive pre- mium only on those conversions or transfers that are not required of them by law or regulation. Emigrant Algerian workers who take their vacations in Algeria may, when returning abroad, re-export foreign exchange freely im- ported and duly declared on their arrival in Algeria. Pilgrims traveling to Saudi Arabia receive an allocation in Saudi Arabian riyals; the amount of this allowance is fixed for each pilgrimage and may be furnished in the form of checks that may be cashed on arrival for those traveling by sea or by air. Resident travelers may take out Algerian dinar bank notes up to DA 50 a person. Foreign nonresident travelers may also re-export any foreign currency declared upon entry. However, on their arrival in Algeria, foreign nonresidents must convert foreign exchange equivalent to a minimum of DA 1,000. Travel tickets that are bought by nonresidents for traveling abroad must be paid for with imported foreign exchange. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Certain exports, including used equipment and machinery, livestock, firearms, ammunition, explosives, and certain radio equipment, are prohibited regardless of destination. All other exports require a license, except those under- taken by state enterprises having a monopoly right to 68 export. Some commodities may be exported, subject to individual prior 684 approval, on the basis of linked transactions (transactions liees) involving at the same time an authorized import transaction. Since the pro- mulgation of Law No. 78-02 of February 11, 1978, which conferred upon the Government a monopoly over foreign trade, exports may only be effected by public sector entities, unless a waiver is granted for a transitional period on a case-by-case basis. Exports must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Sales on consignment are subject to authorization by the Ministry of Finance, and registration must take place prior to customs clearance. Export proceeds must be repatriated immediately after collection. Unless a waiver is granted by the Ministry of Finance or the Central Bank of Algeria, the time limit for repatriation of export proceeds is 120 days from the date of shipment. However, for exports of hydrocarbons, the time limit is a maxi- mum of 30 days after the completion of loading. Those petroleum companies that hold mineral rights must re- patriate to Algeria the proceeds from their exports of hydrocarbons, calculated on the basis of a contractual price a barrel that is fixed by agreement with the com- panies concerned. For one petroleum company holding mineral rights, however, there are different repatriation requirements. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be repatriated and sur- rendered. Savings repatriated in the form of convertible currencies by Algerians working abroad are eligible for an encouragement premium. There are no restrictions on the import of foreign bank notes, coin (except gold coin), checks, and letters of credit, but nonresidents, including those of Algerian nationality, must declare such holdings when they enter Algeria. Resident travelers may reimport Algerian dinar bank notes up to DA 50 a person. Non- resident travelers are not permitted to bring in Algerian bank notes. Capital Residents are obliged to repatriate and surrender capital assets (or the sales proceeds thereof) held or acquired outside Algeria. Capital transfers to any destination are subject to individual license; residents are not normally permitted to acquire capital assets outside Algeria. All borrowing abroad or from nonresidents is subject to prior approval by the Minister of Finance or the Central Bank. The Investment Code of September 15, 1966 provides for state guarantees in respect of foreign investments of more than DA 500,000 in the industrial and tourist sectors and for a retransfer guarantee in respect of the sale or liquidation proceeds of invested foreign capital. It also establishes that profit remittances on such investments will be permitted up to 15 percent annually of the foreign capital originally invested. Tax facilities may also be granted, and investments of more than DA 5 million may be given exclusive rights in a specified geographic area and may be accorded tariff protection. Remittances of ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ALGERIA profits and retransfers of capital are permitted only in respect of investments approved under the code. The law on joint ventures with foreign companies, which came into effect in April 1982, provides foreign partners with a guarantee of fair return on investment, tax exemptions of up to five years on industrial and commercial profits, reduced taxes on reinvested profits, and the repatriation of earnings and royalties in respect of transfers of technology. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Algeria for numismatic purposes. Under Ordinance No. 70-6 of January 16, 1970, unworked gold for industrial and professional use is distributed by the Agence Na- tionale pour la Distribution et la Transformation de TOr et des Autres Metaux Precieux (AGENOR). This agency is also authorized to purchase in Algeria, and to hold, process, and distribute any other precious metal, and, within the exchange control regulations, to import and export any precious metal, including gold. Imports of gold for use by dentists and goldsmiths are made by AGENOR, under import licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. Changes During 1987 Payments for Invisibles January 1. The allowance for travel abroad for purposes other than medical treatment was limited to DA 1,000 every four years for a person over 18 years of age; previously, the same allowance was granted every two years. 69 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Antigua and Barbuda is the Eastern Caribbean Dollar,1 which is issued by the Eastern Ca- ribbean Central Bank (ECCB). The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at EC$2.70 per US$1. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar quoted by the ECCB in its transactions with commercial banks were EC$2.6949 and EC$2.7084, respectively, per US$1. The ECCB also quotes daily rates for the Canadian dollar and the pound sterling. Ail foreign exchange transactions are subject to a levy of 1 percent; the minimum levy is EC$1 a transaction. Antigua and Barbuda formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement as from November 22, 1983. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Finance and applies to all currencies. Export licensing is required for a range of products, particularly those subject to export duties. Import licenses are issued by the Collector of Customs in the Ministry of Finance and by the Ministry of Economic Development, depending on the type of commodity. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Settlements with residents of member countries of the Caribbean Common Market (CARicoM)2 must be made either in the currency of the CARICOM country concerned or in Eastern Caribbean dollars. Settlements with resi- dents of other countries may be made either in any foreign currency or in Eastern Caribbean dollars. Settlements involving South African currency are not permitted. Nonresident Accounts External accounts may be opened for nonresidents with the approval of the Ministry of Finance and may be maintained in any currency. With the approval of the Ministry of Finance, such accounts may also be opened by resident individuals or firms in tourist-oriented indus- tries or in export trades where most receipts are in foreign currency and a large portion of inputs are imported or are financed in foreign currency. External accounts can be credited with receipts from sales of merchandise (whether from export-oriented or local production) or from remittances.

Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. Most goods may be freely imported under open general license granted by the Ministry of Finance. Certain other com- modities require individual licenses, unless imported from CARICOM countries. Antigua and Barbuda follows the CARICOM rules of origin adopted in June 1981. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon application and submission of documentary evidence. Authority is dele- gated to commercial banks to approve application forms for import licenses after confirming sight of documents. The approved forms must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance on a weekly basis. Imports that are exempt from import duties include basic foods and agricultural imports. All other exemp- tions, for machinery, equipment, and raw materials, are granted on a case-by-case basis and generally under the Fiscal Incentives Law and the Hotel Incentives Act. Payments for Invisibles Upon presentation of supporting documents, and with the authorization of the Ministry of Finance, residents may purchase foreign exchange up to the equivalent of US$750 a trip outside the ECCB area; however, this limit may be exceeded with permission from the Ministry of Finance. In terms of CARICOM traveler's checks (which are denominated in Trinidad and Tobago currency), the basic allowance is TT$500 a trip for holiday travel, TT$2,500 a trip for business, and TT$3,000 a trip for medical expenses. Official authorization is required be- yond these limits. There are no limits on the amount of local currency that may be taken out of the country. Profits may be remitted in fu l l, subject to confirmation by the Commission of Inland Revenue of registration for corporate income tax purposes. Student remittances are usually exempted from the foreign exchange levy. Exports and Export Proceeds No export licenses are required for certain commodities to any destination. No surrender of export proceeds is required, and re-exports are not subject to any tax if they take place within the bonded area. Proceeds from Invisibles Travelers to Antigua and Barbuda may bring in freely notes and coins denominated in Eastern Caribbean dollars or in any foreign currency. Foreign currency coin is not normally exchanged. Checks and drafts in U.S. and Canadian currency can be tendered up to US$1,000 without restriction; for amounts over US$1,000, Ministry of Finance approval must be obtained. Levy exemptions for transfers, especially for charity purposes, are usually granted. ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Argentina is the Austral (plural Aus- trales). A dual exchange rate system is operated, with a freely fluctuating, market-determined exchange rate for all transactions not required to be channeled through the official exchange market. The transactions to be con- ducted at the official exchange rate include all merchandise trade,1 all public sector transactions, all disbursements from international organizations, the amortization and refinancing of private sector loans disbursed before Oc- tober 9,1987, and the servicing of debt contracted through the official market. The official exchange rate for the austral in terms of U.S. dollars is announced on a daily basis by the Central Bank of Argentina. On Decem- ber 31, 1987 the closing rate for the austral in terms of the U.S. dollar was A 3.75 = US$1 (selling). Transactions are allowed in certain other currencies,2 with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar on markets abroad. Purchases and sales of foreign exchange are subject to a tax of 0.6 percent. Forward exchange operations are permitted in the private sector with maturities of up to 180 days and at rates agreed by buyers and sellers; such operations must be related to trade transactions, financial loans, or other transactions for which transactions in foreign cur- rency are permitted. Exchange rate guarantees operate in respect of certain financial transactions (see section on Capital, below). Argentina formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from May 14, 1968. Administration of Control All exchange transactions must be carried out through entities authorized expressly for this purpose. These authorized entities include banks, exchange agencies, exchange houses, and exchange offices; each of these types of institutions may be subject to separate regulation. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Virtually all payments between Argentina and Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ec- uador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela are made through accounts maintained by the Central Bank of Argentina and the central banks concerned, under reciprocal credit agreements within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Under an agreement 1 Except for a small number of transactions that have to be effected through the free market. 2 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Portuguese escudos, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 72 maintained with Bolivia, a fixed proportion of Argentina's payments for Bolivia's natural gas exports is made into a non-interest-bearing account at the Central Bank of Argentina, and it is used solely for purchases of Argentine goods to be consumed in Bolivia and for Bolivia's debt- service payments to Argentina. Argentina maintains re- ciprocal credit arrangements with Bulgaria, Cuba, Hun- gary, Poland, and the U.S.S.R. by means of special accounts in each central bank through which transactions are settled. Transactions with other countries must be settled in freely usable currencies. Nonresident Accounts Authorized banks may open accounts in australes and in foreign exchange in the name of any nonresident, provided that the accounts are credited with remittances of convertible currencies only. Balances on nonresident accounts may be used freely for any purpose, in Argentina or abroad. Transfers between accounts may be effected freely, except in payment for exports. Imports and Import Payments Import payments may be effected in convertible cur- rencies, except as otherwise specified in the regulations on prescription of currency. Settlement of payments for imports by the private sector may be freely effected by authorized financial entities, provided that the financing conforms to terms established by the Central Bank, and payment may be effected up to two business days prior to the due date; otherwise, if payment is not effected on the due date, it is postponed for a minimum period as defined in the prevailing regulation for such an operation. Payment may be effected before the expiration of the minimum period if the domestic debtor pays a premium to the Central Bank. The premium is calculated by the application of specified rates, determined daily by the Central Bank, on the f.o.b. value of the debt (converted at the exchange rate in effect at the time of shipment) for the period since the original maturity date. Imports and related payments by the public sector require the prior approval of the Central Bank. In addition to customs duties, imports are subject to a stamp duty of 0.6 percent and selective internal taxes ranging from 5 percent to 22 percent; certain imports are subject to a special emergency import surcharge of 15 percent. Most public and private sector imports require a " Sworn Declaration of Need to Import" to be submitted by the importer to the intervening banks, which are authorized to accept, check, and process these declarations and submit them to the National Import Directorate. Some imports require an import license (Certificate of Sworn Declaration of Need to Import) issued by the National Import Directorate. Certain public enterprises are also permitted to import under foreign treaties without the issuance of an import license. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Import license requests submitted by the private sector to the Industry and Foreign Trade Secretariat are issued only after the importer has placed with a bank a deposit equal to either the estimated duty payable on the import, or 5 percent of the import value, in cases of lower or equivalent value. The deposits are blocked until the import duty is paid or for a period of time defined in the Central Bank regulations, whichever is earlier; they are indexed in terms of the U.S. dollar. The following set of procedures apply to the acquisition of an import license for all imports that require licensing. Although the import of goods classified as "nonessential" (List I) is technically prohibited, all goods on List I have been transferred to List II (see below) on a temporary basis. The goods temporarily on List II include consumer goods and industrial inputs for which close substitutes are amply available in Argentina. The prohibition on the importation of goods on List I, when it applies, does not apply to temporary imports, goods included in the border traffic scheme, or samples and prototypes. The Secretary of Commerce is empowered to grant import licenses for goods on List I when the item is considered necessary for scientific or technical reasons, or in light of the quantity or quality of domestic production. Most capital goods, certain industrial inpu ts, and goods temporarily transferred from the list of prohibited goods are included in List II. For goods on this list, the Industry and Commerce Secretariat issues import licenses in con- sultation with an Honorary Import Advisory Committee on which both government institutions and competent commercial and industrial organizations are represented. When the industrial section of the Industry and Foreign Trade Secretariat does not approve an import license request, the Secretariat is empowered to study the indi- vidual case and make a determination. Import licenses for certain raw materials and inputs for the pharmaceutical industry and for medical and health services (List III) require the prior approval of the Ministry of Health and Social Action, and licenses for imports intended for national defense and for the security and police forces require the prior approval of the Ministries of Defense or Interior. Import licenses are granted automatically for all goods not specifically covered by the foregoing provisions. These include goods imported under the Temporary Admission Regime. Also, goods imported under conces- sions granted by any instrument of the LAIA agreement are exempt from the prohibition applicable to goods on List I and the review requirement for goods on List II. Import licenses are issued automatically for goods covered under the Argentine-Uruguayan Economic Cooperation Agreement. The actual import value (f.o.b.) must be no more than 10 percent above the stated value of the sworn declaration submitted in application for an import license. Countertrade is permitted for firms engaging in the exportation of promoted exports. In such cases, import payments can take the form of the exportation of promoted goods. ARGENTINA Most imports are subject to m in imum financing terms of at least 180 days, calculated from the date of shipment. However, imports of goods on the negotiated lists from the LAIA have a m in imum financing term of 90 days, and those not in the negotiated lists, a term of 120 days. Most other imports from Latin America, including those from the Central American Common Market (CACM), Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Panama, are subject to m in imum financing terms of 120 days from shipment. Payment against shipping documents is per- mitted in the following cases: goods imported from Bolivia (within the LAIA framework); from Brazil (''negotiated goods"); Chile ("negotiated goods"); Ecuador ("nego- tiated goods"); Mexico (goods under trade compensation programs); Paraguay (certain specified goods); Peru (goods negotiated under LAIA Agreement No. 6); Uruguay (goods negotiated under the Partial Scope Agreement on Economic Complementation No. 1 and the 1984 Agricul- tural Agreement); fresh fruit received on a consignment basis; and periodicals. Imports destined for the Special Customs Area of Tierra del Fuego (Law No. 19640) are subject to the following minimum financing terms: 75 days for imports on the "Negotiated List" shipped from and originating in LAIA countries; 105 days for "nonnegotiated" imports from the LAIA and imports from the CACM, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, or Panama; and 150 days for imports from all other countries. Special m in imum financing terms apply to imports of capital goods valued at more than US$50,000. Not more than 5 percent of the f.o.b. value may be settled prior to shipment, and an additional 10 percent may be paid upon the submission of shipping documents. The balance of 85 percent is to be paid in equal installments beginning not earlier than six months after shipment, according to the following schedule. Value of Import (f.o.b.) (In thousands ofU,S. dollars) 50-250 250-500 500-1,000 1,000-1,500 1,500-2,000 More than 2,000 Minimum Financing Term 1 year 2 years 3 years 4 years 5 years To be determined upon consultation with the Cen- tral Bank Imports of capital goods for which financing amounting to 85 percent of the f.o.b. value as a minimum is provided by international organizations or official creditors are exempt from these minimum terms (the terms of the contract loans apply in these cases), as are imports by firms located in the National Territories of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica, and the Islands of the South Atlantic, which are subject to the terms indicated above. 73 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA Payments for Invisibles Certain payments for invisibles require prior approval by the Central Bank. In general, the sale of foreign exchange at the official rate is not permitted for invisible payments; all payments may be made through the free exchange market, with the exception of transfers of profits and dividend earnings. Authorized entities may carry out most types of transactions without prior authorization of the Central Bank. Exports and Export Proceeds Minimum export prices (reference prices) are estab- lished for many agricultural and livestock exports as a basis for the payment of duties and the surrender of export proceeds. The full f.o.b. proceeds from all exports must be repatriated and surrendered; the proceeds must not be less than the reference price, or if there is no reference price, the f.o.b. value declared on the shipping permit. Proceeds may be received in any convertible currency. Proceeds from traditional exports must be received before shipment by means of advance payments or irrevocable letters of credit payable against shipping documents in Argentina. Proceeds from promoted exports must be repatriated within 180 days from the date of shipment. In both cases, export proceeds must be sur- rendered within 15 working days from the respective time limits. A number of traditional exports (soybeans, beef, and processed hides) are subject to export taxes. Certain nontraditional exports are eligible for rebates of estimated indirect taxes paid in the process of production. Exports shipped through certain ports are eligible for additional rebates ranging from 7 percent to 12 percent. Many exports, particularly nontraditional exports, are eligible for other export incentives of various kinds. The Central Bank has established a number of special financing regimes to be granted to Argentine exporters through banks, with a view to promoting exports of certain goods and services. Also, the Argentine Export Credit Insurance Company provides credit insurance against commercial and ordinary risks and also coverage for extraordinary risks (on the account of the Central Government) for exports of capital goods and other specified consumer goods. Certain products, mostly nontraditional exports, may be shipped "on consignment" for 360 days; if not sold within that period, the goods must be returned to Argentina. Various export incentives are provided for promoted exports in accordance with the Export Promotion Laws of December 16, 1984. These include: (1) a deduction from taxable profits, up to 10 percent of the value of certain exports; (2) the creation of export consortia and cooperatives and the granting of an incentive equal to 4 percent of the f.o.b. value of exports over a period of five years; (3) the establishment of international trading companies; (4) permission for firms to engage in coun- tertrade when marketing promoted exports; (5) a tax drawback scheme under which rebates would be allowed 74 for taxes of imported inputs and other taxes; (6) the elimination of the 0.5 percent stamp tax for exports from the Federal Capital Area; and (7) the fund ing of an Export Promotion Fund to finance participation in trade fairs and exhibitions. Under the ARGEX program, enterprises that can estab- lish that their export receipts are at least three times their import payments are eligible for automatic and unre- stricted access to the Temporary Admission Regime for all inputs and intermediate products and to prefinancing. Under the Special Export Programs, exporters of specified goods who commit themselves to expanding exports are eligible for special payments from the Treasury of up to 15 percent of the increase in the f.o.b. value of exports, for access to Central Bank prefinancing, and for other benefits. For traditional exports, the max imum terms for antic- ipated payments and foreign currency export prefinance are 360 days for processed goods, 240 days for vegetable oils and their by-products, peas, garden produce, chick- peas, rice, wheat flour, and processed meats, and 180 days for grains and other unprocessed agricultural prod- ucts. For nontraditional exports, the maximum term for anticipated paymen ts and foreign currency export prefi- nance is 360 days. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign currency receipts devised from private sector invisibles transactions need not be surrendered to the official exchange market, but may be sold in the free exchange market. Travelers may bring in freely any amount in domestic or foreign bank notes and coin, as well as gold coin and "good delivery" gold bars. Capital Proceeds from private sector financial loans must be transacted in the free foreign exchange market after October 1987; those transacted before this date in the unified exchange market are eligible for subsequent pur- chases of official foreign exchange to service such loans. Private sector loans disbursed since October 1987 are serviced through the free exchange market. Proceeds of loans from international organizations, and of all public sector borrowing, may be transacted in the free or official foreign exchange market and must be serviced through the market where the proceeds were transacted. Proceeds from financial loans must be transacted through the official market only if they are to be used as supplementary funds in relending operations. For these loans, interest rates may not exceed LIBOR plus 1 percent, must have maturities of at least 360 days, and in all cases must have fixed maturity dates. There are no conditions, on maturity dates or interest rates, for financial loans transacted through the free market. Principal and interest payments for loans received after November 28, 1984 may be effected directly through authorized entities on the ma- turity date w i thout prior central bank authorization. All amortization payments for loans received not sub ject to regulation A 558 and not related to import operations ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution carried out in accordance with the m in imum conditions specified for such payments may be settled through the subscription of U.S. dollar bonds of the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic, payable in 15 semiannual install- ments, with a grace period of three years. All loans outstanding and covered by a swap agreement with the Central Bank as of December 4, 1982 and all loans for which the domestic borrower has obtained an exchange rate guarantee from the Central Bank and which fell due through the end of 1985 have been extended under m in imum terms established by the Central Bank. Loans covered by swap agreements that fell due in 1985 were either to be rescheduled by means of the issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of the Central Bank (BCRA Notes) w i th a ten-year ma tu r i ty, or by a direct refinancing between debtor and creditor for up to five years followed by the issuance of a BCRA Note for the remainder of a ten-year period. Loans covered by exchange rate guarantees that fell due in 1986 were rescheduled by means of the issuance of U.S. dollar- denominated obligations of the Government of Argentina (Notes) with a 19-year maturity from October 1987. The inflow of financial loans undertaken by local foreign-owned enterprises and originating from foreign enterprises that either directly or indirectly control the borrowing enterprises or are their subsidiaries requires the prior approval of the Central Bank. Loans endorsed or guaranteed by the State also require prior authorization from the Central Bank. Banks may accept foreign cur- rency sight or term deposits; in the latter case, deposits must be for the account and to the order of the Central Bank, with maturities of 60-360 days. Foreign borrowing by the public sector is regulated by Decree-Law No. 19328 of October 29, 1971 and Decree No. 3532 of November 24, 1975. Outward capital transfers are not permitted through the official market but may be effected through the free market without restrictions. The foreign investment regime is governed by the Foreign Investment Law (codified text of 1980), which incorporates the amendments made under Law No. 22208 to Law No. 21382. Promulgated by Decree No. 1062 of June 30, 1980, the Foreign Inves tment Law is regulated by Decree No. 103 of January 19, 1981. Investments may be made in freely convertible foreign currency in the form of new or used capital goods and their spare parts and accessories; profits and capital in Argentine currency belonging to foreign investors (provided that they are legally transferable abroad); capitalization of external credits received in freely convertible foreign currency; intangible assets; and any other form acceptable to the implementing authority or covered by a special regime or a promotion regime. For approval purposes, investments are classified into three categories, as follows: (1) Subject to prior approval by the National Executive are (a) investments in the defense and national security sectors, in public service sectors including the postal system, electricity, gas, telecommunications, computers, electronic equipment, and in radio transmitters, television ARGENTINA stations, newspapers, periodicals and magazines, energy, education, and financial and insurance institutions; (b) transfers of capital and the acquisition of shares (the latter is permissible only in exceptional cases when it is mani- festly beneficial to the national economy) that involve changing the national ownership structure of a local firm belonging to national investors and having net assets exceeding US$10 million; (c) new transfers of freely convertible foreign currency not exceeding US$5 million and not involving a change in the national ownership structure of an existing local firm; (d) investment in any of Argentina's stock markets, provided that the amount does not exceed US$2 million for each foreign investor and so long as total foreign investment does not exceed 2 percent of the capital of the company involved; (e) inves tmen ts in which the investor is a juridical person under public law; and (f) investments in which special or promotional benefits are requested that can only be granted by the National Executive and the proposed investment is contingent on them. (2) No prior approval is required for (a) total or partial reinvestment of a registered foreign investor's profits (even in the sectors referred to in item (1) above), provided that they do not involve changing the national ownership structure of the receiving firm and are intended to foster the activities for which the original investment was approved or in which the firm was engaged when the law entered into force; (b) new investments in freely con- vertible foreign currency made for the same purposes as mentioned in item (1) above, and not exceeding 30 percent of the registered capital in the receiving firm and which do not involve converting it into a "domestic firm with foreign capital," or new investments that are made pursuant to a preferential right and in order to maintain an interest equal to or lower than what was held up to that time; (c) new transfers of freely convertible foreign currency not exceeding US$5 million and not involving a change in the national ownership structure of an existing local firm; and (d) investment in any of Argentina's stock markets, provided that the amount does not exceed US$2 million for each foreign investor and so long as total foreign investment does not exceed 2 percent of the capital of the company involved. (3) All other foreign investments are subject to prior approval by the implementing authority, which must give its decision within 120 days from the date on which the investment proposal is submitted. Foreign investments existing prior to the entry into force of the Foreign Investment Law are governed by its provisions, which include a special regime for their inscription and recognition. Existing and new foreign investments, as well as all capital movements relating thereto, may be recorded in the Register of Foreign Investments, which is kept by the Ministry of Economy. Since September 1984, the Central Bank has entertained applications for the capitalization into foreign direct investment of principal falling due with an exchange rate guarantee. From February to September 1985, many such applications were approved, but since then approval has 75 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA not been forthcoming. In addition, although no Central Bank circular has provided formal authorization, certain requests for the capitalization into foreign direct invest- ment of swaps falling due were approved in 1985. No transactions of this type took place in 1986 or 1987. In October 1987 a debt conversion scheme was an- nounced that would allow investments to be financed through conversion of external loan claims into domestic currency at the free foreign exchange market rate. The value of the loan claims would be determined through an auction system. The scheme came into effect on Janu- ary 1, 1988, and the first auction was held in January 1988. Profits on investments under this scheme may not be remitted for at least four years, and capital may not be repatriated for ten years. Other registered foreign investments may generally be repatriated three years after entry into Argentina, unless a longer period was fixed when the investment was approved. The right to transfer profits and to repatriate capital related to properly registered investments can be suspended only by the National Executive. In that event, registered foreign investors are entitled to receive, for the remittance of profits abroad, the equivalent of the sum to be transferred in external public debt securities denominated in foreign currency at the rate of interest prevailing in the international market, against provision of the equivalent in Argentine currency; this regulation is applied under Decree No. 1506/84, which also prohibits the repatriation of capital. Profits on registered foreign capital are subject to a special tax on after-tax profit when they exceed 12 percent of registered capital on an annual basis. This tax is 15 percent for profits of more than 12 percent and up to 15 percent of registered capital, 20 percent for those of more than 15 percent and up to 20 percent of registered capital, and 25 percent for those of more than 20 percent of registered capital. The extension of domestic credit to "domestic firms with foreign capital" is subject to special provisions, as set forth in Law No. 21382 (Article 17) and Decree No. 283/77 (Article 71, as amended in 1980). Gold Residents may hold gold coin and gold in any other form in Argentina or abroad. Financial institutions, ex- change houses, and exchange agencies may buy or sell gold in the form of coin or good delivery bars among themselves or buy such gold from their clients. Gold exports must be paid for in convertible currencies. Imports of gold by industrial users are subject to a statistical duty of 0.6 percent, and those by other users are subject in addition to a sales tax. Institutions may carry out arbitrage operations on coined gold or "good delivery" gold with their clients, against foreign bank notes. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement October 14. The dual exchange rate system was intro- duced, whereby certain current and capital transactions 76 were allowed to be transacted through the free exchange market. Transactions that are initially channeled through the official exchange market include all merchandise trade; public sector transactions, including the servicing of all all public and publicly guaranteed debt; disbursement and amortization of loans from international organizations; amortization and refinancing of all private sector loans disbursed before October 9, 1987; and the servicing of all loans disbursed through the official exchange market. The exchange rate in the official market was initially set at A 3.50 per US$ 1. All other transactions may be effected through the free exchange market. December 30. Trade-related service payments were shifted from the official to the free exchange market. The official exchange rate was also depreciated to A 3.75 per US$1. Imports and Import Payments March 4. Some 3,100 items were added to the temporary admission regime, under which imports of inputs used in the production of exports are permitted duty free. Certain petrochemical products were excluded from the list of products, subject to prior authorization. March 26. Certain food items and various textile prod- ucts were excluded from the list of imports subject to prior study, thus allowing imports of these products without restriction. For goods remaining subject to prior study, the period of review was reduced to a maximum of 15 days. October 14. Some 650 items were added to the tem- porary admission regime. October 16. An import surcharge of 5 percent was introduced for the period through end-1988, in addition to the 10 percent surcharge. October 21. Paper and paper products were excluded from the list of imports subject to prior authorization. December 20. Certain chemical and petrochemical products were excluded from the list of imports subject to prior authorization. December 21. Producers of goods used in the production of exports were given access to the temporary admission regime. Payments for Invisibles June 1. Remittance of profits accruing from investment made under the debt-equity conversion scheme was permitted after four years. Exports and Export Proceeds September 9. Producers of inputs used in the production of exports were given access to the regime of prefinancing for promoted exports. September 22. Export taxes were eliminated on wheat, corn, sorghum, and edible oil and reduced on unprocessed soybeans, sunflower seeds, flax, and wood products. October 14. Certain agro-industrial exports were in- cluded in the scheme under which a rebate of up to 5 percent of indirect taxes that had been incurred in the process of export production is given. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA November 12. An insurance mechanism was introduced to provide collateral for export financing operations by small- and medium-sized enterprises. Capital June 1. General guidelines were announced for the debt-equity conversion scheme. Most publicly guaranteed debt would be eligible for conversion, and projects that result in the purchase of new equipment, establishment of new plants, or increases in capacity would be eligible investments under the program. Eligible debt would be converted at face value at the official exchange rate and would need to be accompanied by an inflow of matching funds at least equal to the face value of the debt. Redemption or distribution of the resulting investment would not be permitted for ten years from the date of the investment. Annual quotas are set for the amount of debt to equity conversion, providing for a total conversion of US$1.9 billion over five years. October 14. The debt conversion scheme was modified. Investors were now required to provide matching funds of 30 percent rather than 50 percent of the approved investment, and these funds may be in foreign or domestic currency. However, the import content of any new investment financed through conversion schemes must be covered with foreign exchange. With the introduction of a market-determined exchange rate for nontrade trans- actions by the private sector, debt will now be converted into domestic currency at the exchange rate in the free, rather than the official, exchange market. 77 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRALIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Australia is the Australian Dollar.1 The Australian authorities do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions; exchange rates are determined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange market, but the Reserve Bank of Australia retains discretionary power to intervene in the foreign exchange market. On December 31, 1987 the closing buying and selling rates in terms of the U.S. dollar were $A 1.3837 = US$1 and $A 1.3847 = US$1, respectively. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized foreign exchange dealers may deal among themselves and with their customers at mutually negoti- ated rates for both spot and forward transactions in any currency, in respect of trade and non-trade-related trans- actions. The Reserve Bank sets a limit for each dealer's net open overnight foreign exchange exposure. Foreign currency fu tures contracts and options on futures are traded on the Sydney Futures Exchange. As part of Australia's current foreign exchange arrange- ments, a range of outward foreign exchange transactions is subject to procedural requirements in order to meet the Governmen t's taxation screening policies. A taxation clearance certificate issued by the Australian Taxation Office must be shown to authorized foreign exchange dealers before foreign exchange or other means of pay- ment is made available for certain transactions with residents of designated countries and areas2 and for emigrants' remittances in excess of $A 50,000 or its foreign currency equivalent to all countries. In respect of countries that are not designated for taxation screening purposes, foreign exchange dealers are obliged to require that their customers complete declaration forms for out- flows of more than $A 50,000 or its foreign currency equivalent and which relate to investments, gifts, suste- nance and trust distributions, loans or loan repayments, travel expenditure, remittances connected with fu tures operations overseas and payments of interest, dividends, service fees, or royalties. Australia formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from July 1, 1965. Administration of Control The Reserve Bank is responsible for administering the remaining exchange control restrictions under Australia's current foreign exchange arrangements. (Most exchange controls were abolished on December 12, 1983.) 1 The Australian dollar also circulates in several other countries, including Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. 2 These are listed as The Bahamas, Bermuda, British Channel Islands, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Grenada, Hong Kong, Isle of Man, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Nauru, the Netherlands An t i l les, Panama, Switzerland, Tonga, and Vanua tu. 78 Prescription of Currency Both outward and inward paymen ts may be settled in Australian currency or in any foreign currency,3 but purchases and sales of foreign currency by persons in Australia in exchange for Australian currency must be undertaken with an authorized foreign exchange dealer in Australia. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may establish and fund accounts without formality; funds may also be repatriated without restric- tion. Accounts may be denominated in foreign currency, but purchases and sales of foreign currency must be handled through authorized dealers in Australia. Special requirements apply in the case of interest-bearing invest- ments by foreign government monetary authorities (see section on Capital, below). Imports and Import Payments Nearly all goods may be imported without import licenses, and no restrictions are imposed on payments for imports. Import licensing restrictions are imposed on a small range of second-hand equipment although not for exchange control purposes. Tariff quotas apply to most clothing and footwear. Import restrictions are maintained mainly for reasons of health, community protection, or to sustain quality standards. There is provision in the Customs Tariff Antidumping Act 1975 for action to be taken when dumped imports have caused, are causing, or are threatening to cause material injury to Australian industries. Dumping duties may be imposed unless the exporters voluntarily raise their export prices to the level necessary to remove injury. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are not restricted, subject to the Government's taxation screening requirements being met. (See section on Exchange Arrangement, above.) Travelers may take out of Australia up to $A 5,000 in Australian notes and coins in any combination. Travelers who are not residents of Australia may take out without formality any amount in foreign currency or Australian currency instruments (other than Australian currency notes and coins), provided that they brought them into Australia. Exports and Export Proceeds Export permits or licenses are not required except in respect of goods covered by the Export Control Act, Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, Protection of 3 Foreign currencies are defined as aJl currencies other than the Australian dollar. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Movable Cultural Heritage Act, and the Wildlife Protec- tion Regulation of Exports and Imports Act. There are no formalities covering the disposal of export proceeds. Under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, the export of specified minerals, metals, hydrocarbons, and nuclear-sensitive material is prohibited unless per- mission is granted by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy or an authorized person. Exports are controlled for d ifferent objectives for in- dividual mineral commodities. Depending on the com- modity, the objectives may be one or more of the following: (1) pricing and other contractual conditions are fair in relation to the market, consistent w i th maximizing the trade benef i ts for Australia; (2) exports are in com- pliance with Australia's nuclear policy, international ob- ligations, and bilateral agreements where applicable; e.g., the Non-Proliferation Treaty, as well as bilateral agree- ments between Australia and each of its nuclear customer countries; (3) supplies are adequate for domestic require- ments; and (4) the provisions of the Env ironment Protec- tion (Impact of Proposals) Act and the Australian Heritage Commission Act are met. There are active controls on exports of a lum ina, baux- ite, coal, iron ore, u ran ium, and other materials of nuclear significance. On the completion of negotiations, exporters of these minerals are required to seek approval from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. For ne- gotiation of contracts for the sale of u ran ium, they must meet the requirements of the Ministerial Determinations issued to the three producers. Exporters of ores, concen- trates, matte and oxides of copper, lead, manganese, nickel (except nickel powder) and zinc, blister and refined copper, lead bullion, salt, petroleum products, and liq- uefied petroleum gas and condensate are given, on ap- plication, automatic approval to export expected ship- ments over designated periods. Approvals to export mineral sands are freely issued, except when the Gov- ernment considers that env ironmen tal reasons would make such exports undesirable. For exports of monazite and xenotime, additional requirements must be met under the Governmen t's nuclear safeguards policy before export approval can be given. Exports of copper scrap and copper alloy scrap are embargoed, and quotas apply to secondary copper ingots and other basic shapes made from scrap material. Export of petroleum and petroleum products to South Africa is prohibited. No other minerals are subject to control. Export control arrangements are under review. With respect to rural commodities, the Government follows the general principle that exporters should be the main negotiators for export contracts and that the market should determine prices. Generally, the export control power is not used but is held in reserve to be used if and when the need arises, consistent with the need to protect the national interest and to meet market access limitations imposed by importing countries. There are also provisions for government control over the export of defense material. AUSTRALIA Proceeds from Invisibles Earnings of invisibles in foreign currencies may be retained or sold for Australian dollars. Travelers may bring in any amount in foreign or domestic bank notes. Capital Subject to the procedural requirements of the Govern- men t 's taxation screening arrangements being me t, the vast majority of transactions involving transfers of capital from Australia and nonresident investments at interest in Australia may be undertaken without formality. The only exceptions are that borrowings in Australia by foreign governments, their agencies not similar to private sector commercial entities, and international organizations are not permitted. Moreover, while there are no limits apply- ing to the interest-bearing investments by international organizations or by foreign central banks and other monetary authorities, the Reserve Bank may determine an amount up to which the investment by foreign gov- ernment monetary institutions (which also undertake commercial inves tmen ts) will be regarded as having been undertaken for official foreign reserve management pur- poses and hence qualify for sovereign immun i ty from Australian taxation. All investing agencies are expected to be stable holders of Australian dollar assets and keep the Reserve Bank advised of their Australian dollar portfolio. Direct investment in Australia by nonresidents is sub- ject to the Governmen t's foreign investment policy, which is based on the recognition that foreign inves tment makes a substantial contribution to the development of Austra- lia's industries and resources. The Government's policy is therefore to welcome and encourage long-term direct foreign inves tment that has beneficial economic effects and is consistent with the needs of the Australian com- mun i ty. Australia's foreign inves tment policy is concerned primarily with direct foreign investment that has signifi- cant implications for the levels of foreign ownership and foreign control of Australian industries and resources. Portfolio (debt and equity) investment is not subject to the policy. Certain types of investment proposals by foreign inter- ests are subject to examination by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which is the advisory body to the Gov- ernment on foreign investment matters. Proposals subject to review include those falling within the scope of the Foreign Takeovers Act 1975; those involving the estab- lishment of a new business or project, irrespective of size, in the media and civil aviation sectors, or in other sectors where the total amount of the investment is $A 10 million or more (including diversification into activities not previously undertaken directly in Australia and new projects in mining and primary industries); those involving direct investment by foreign governments or their agencies (excluding investments related to their official representation); and proposals to acquire real estate and undertake real estate development projects. The Foreign Takeovers Act 1975 is concerned with the acquisition of companies or businesses operating in Aus- 79 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRALIA tralia by foreign interests. The Act requires nonresidents, non-resident-controlled corporations or businesses, and Australian companies in which nonresidents have a sub- stantial shareholding to notify the Government of pro- posals to acquire, or alter, a substantial interest in a company. A substantial foreign interest is an interest of 15 percent or more in the ownership or voting power of a corporation or business by a single foreign interest, either alone or together with associates, or an interest of 40 percent or more in aggregate in the ownership or voting power of a cooperation or business by two or more foreign interests and their associates. New investments (and acquisitions of existing busi- nesses) in the majority of industrial sectors are approved unless judged contrary to the national interest. Proposals involving civil aviation and the media are examined on a case-by-case basis and acquisitions of existing mining (non-oil and gas) operations are approved if sufficient economic benefits can be demonstrated. Restrictions apply to developed residential real estate. After inviting applications for banking licenses, the Government selected 16 foreign banks in 1985 to establish banking operations in Australia. It is not envisaged that further such invitations will be issued to foreign interests. The Government's policy on uranium projects provides for no further uranium mines to be developed and for further stages of the nuclear fuel cycle to be prohibited. Australian equity participation guidelines continue to apply in respect of new (non-oil and gas) mining operations and acquisitions of developed nonresidential commercial real estate. The guidelines are, however, applied flexibly. Australia's foreign investment policy also provides an incentive for the "naturalization" of predominantly foreign-owned companies. The naturalization process is an entirely voluntary one and may be entered into by companies that choose to increase the level of Australian participation in their Australian operations. Companies that elect to participate in the naturalization arrangements are entitled to certain benefits while they are naturalizing. In particular, they are accorded prior credit for achieving majority Australian ownership, thereby facilitating their participation in mining projects and ventures that are subject to the Australian equity participation guidelines. In the application of the policies, every effort is made to avoid unnecessary interference in normal commercial processes, and recognition is given to the special char- acteristics and circumstances that may arise in individual cases. The policy is nondiscriminatory as to the country of origin of investors, and the Foreign Investment Review Board, which acts as an independent source of advice to the Government on foreign investment matters, stands ready to assist and advise foreign investors in the for- mulation of their proposals. Gold There are no restrictions on residents owning, buying, or selling gold and gold coin in Australia. Residents may export and import gold other than Krugerrand, subject to normal customs procedures. However, the export of Australian gold coin in excess of five of the $A 200 denomination and in excess of five of the Australian nugget gold coins in any 12-month period requires Reserve Bank approval. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments February 13. The tariff for the lamp indus try was uniformly set at 15 percent. September 4. New procedures for the processing of antidumping and countervailing du ty petitions were an- nounced (Customs Notice No. 87/169). September 13. Tariffs on a number of pharmaceutical products were reduced from 20 percent to the range of 2 percent to 10 percent. September 30. The general tariff on used, reconditioned, and new engines was reduced from 25 percent to 15 percent. Exports and Export Proceeds September 15. The quota on meat exports to the United States for 1987 was set at 327,500 tons. Capital September 29. The Australian Government announced that acquisitions of developed residential real estate by nonresidents would be subject to Government approval under its foreign inves tment policy guidelines; hitherto, nonresidents were permitted to purchase real estate val- ued at up to $A 600,000 in Australian cities without seeking approval. 80 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Austria is the Austrian Schilling. W i thout assuming any formal obligations, the authorities aim at maintaining a stable relation with the currencies participating in the European Monetary System (EMS). Forward transactions are permitted up to 18 mon ths, and they must be related to an authorized transaction in the case of residents. Forward premiums and discounts are, in principle, left to the interplay of market forces, and the Austrian National Bank does not in tervene in the forward market or provide cover for commercial banks' forward positions. On December 31, 1987 the authorized banks' buy ing and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were S 11.065 and S 11.075, respectively, per US$1. There are no exchange taxes or subsidies. Austria formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from August 1, 1962. Administration of Control The Austrian National Bank administers exchange control and issues exchange licenses where required. Most exchange transactions are effected through Austrian banks authorized to implement the exchange control regulations. The customs authorities issue freely and w i thout delay licenses required for imports of liberalized goods. Li- censes, if required, for other imports and for exports have to be obtained from the relevant ministry, namely, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs (Licensing Office) for industrial products, or the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for agricultural products. For products falling under monopoly, licenses are issued by the Ministry of Finance. Prescription of Currency Settlements with all countries may be made either in convertible currencies or through Free Schilling Ac- counts. The exchange control regulations generally are based on the distinction between member countries of the IMF or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and other countries. Nonresident Accounts There are three categories of nonresident accounts in schillings: Free Schilling Accounts, Interim Accounts for nonresidents residing in member countries of the IMF or the OECD, and Blocked Accounts for nonresidents re- siding in other countries. Free Schilling Accounts may be freely opened by Austrian credit institutions on behalf of nonresidents without any formality other than a check by the credit institution of the nonresident status of the beneficiary when the schilling funds are obtained from the selling of freely convertible foreign currencies at a domestic credit institution. Such accounts may be freely credited with proceeds from the sale of convertible currencies by a nonresident to the Austrian National Bank, or to an authorized bank, as well as with payments permitted by the National Bank on the basis of a general or individual authorization. The accounts may be freely debited for payments to Austrian residents, who must, however, apply for individual licenses if they are to receive loans from nonresidents. Balances may be freely converted into any foreign currency. Transfers between these accounts are free. Interim Accounts and Blocked Accounts consist of funds that are due to nonresidents. General licenses permit their use for payments for many current and some capital transactions. The transfer abroad of funds in Interim Accounts and Blocked Accounts is subject to an individual license. Usually, licenses are granted freely if the funds belong to residents of countries that are members of the IMF or the OECD. Nonresidents may also maintain nonresident accounts in convertible foreign currencies. These accounts may be debited for the same purposes as Free Schilling Accounts and are subject to the same conditions. Imports and Import Payments All commodities not included in the Annexes to the Foreign Trade Law are free of import licensing and may be imported from any country without quantitative re- striction. All goods included in the Annexes require licenses, but most are free of quantitative restriction. For many goods licenses are granted by customs at the time of clearance, irrespective of the country they are imported from .1 Nearly all imports from General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) countries, their associated territories, and some other countries2 are liberalized. 1 Goods liberalized for import from a given group of countries may be free ly imported from any coun try in the group, provided that the country of exportation and the country of production of the goods involved are in the same group. 2 The fu ll list is as follows: Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, The Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Bu rund i, Cameroon, Canada, Cape Verde, Central African Re- public, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Congo, Cuba, Cote d'lvoire, Cyprus, Denmark ( inc lud ing Faeroe Islands and Greenland), Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Finland, France, Gabon, The Gambia, Federal Republic of Germany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ire- land, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Democratic Kampuchea, Kenya, Kiribati, Korea, Kuwa i t, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Rwanda, St. Lucia, St. V incent and the Grenadines, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Tuva lu, Uganda, U.S.S.R., United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uru- guay, Vanua tu, People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Yugoslavia, Zaire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. 81 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRIA Austria's GATT liberalization is applied worldwide, ex- cept in respect of certain textiles and clothing as defined in Article XII, Section 1, of the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles. The importation of coffee is governed by the international agreement for this com- modity. Nonliberalized imports may be obtained under various procedures: namely, state trading, global quotas, bilateral quotas, and discretionary licensing. State trading covers tobacco in any form, ethyl alcohol, and salt. Global quotas apply to specified imports from GATT countries; such quotas apply only to potatoes, wheat, and cornstarch, preserved meat, wine, and certain med- icaments. Discretionary individual licensing is applicable to all other private imports not covered by the procedures listed above, including imports of certain textiles from specified countries. Licenses are usually granted if the imports concerned do not adversely affect domestic industries. Grains, milk and butter, and cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and horses for slaughter and products from these animals for human consumption are imported in accordance with a special system of controls and regulations maintained under the Agricultural Marketing Law and the law gov- erning livestock farming and trading, and the marketing of livestock produce (Viehwirtschaftsgesetz). Certain ag- ricultural products are subject to import levies. In some cases, import licenses are issued only to importers who have received export certificates from the countries of their trading partners. Import licenses are not transferable and are valid for six months, but this period may be extended for periods of three months at a time. Payments for imports from, and originating in, countries with which Austria makes settlements in con- vertible currencies do not require exchange licenses. Under the 1982 Customs Preference Act, which covers the second ten-year period of the Austrian Scheme of Generalized Preferences, special treatment is provided for imports from the 31 least-developed countries as defined by the UN General Assembly; the list of products eligible for preferential treatment has also been extended under the Act. Payments for Invisibles With a few exceptions, involving transport and insur- ance transactions, residents are permitted to conclude transactions involving current invisibles with residents of countries that are members of the IMF or the OECD. Most transactions in current invisibles that involve pay- ments to residents of other countries (e.g., freight, com- missions, and the cost of assembly and repairs) are covered by general licenses; for the remaining transac- tions, individual licenses are required. Payments on account of generally authorized invisibles to nonresidents may be made freely, provided that no capital transfer is involved. Other payments abroad up to S 10,000 (up to S 5,000 to non-IMF and non-OECD countries) may be made freely and at any time. The remaining payments on account of invisibles to countries other than members of the IMF and the OECD with 82 which settlements are made in convertible currencies require special licenses. Residents traveling abroad for tourism purposes may purchase foreign exchange from authorized banks or obtain short-term advances from nonresidents in multi- lateral countries without limitation; if the amount exceeds the equivalent of S 50,000, the Austrian National Bank must be informed. In addition, Austrian residents may arrange for trips abroad through travel agents and pay in schillings to cover expenditures for accommodation and food, as well as transportation. The use of credit cards abroad for travel expenditures is permitted. Persons leaving Austria may take with them S 50,000 in Austrian bank notes and coin and any amount in foreign bank notes and coin. Exports and Export Proceeds Licenses for exports regulated under the Foreign Trade Law have to be obtained from the relevant ministry or, at the time of clearance, from the customs authorities. For most exports, licenses are not required. Export licenses are issued with due consideration for the provi- sions of relevant bilateral trade agreements and the fu l f i l lment of quotas established in accordance with such agreements, and for the needs of the Austrian economy. Export claims exceeding the equivalent of S 50,000 must be declared.3 Export proceeds may either be sur- rendered or be deposited in accounts with authorized banks. Such deposits in convertible currencies may be used freely for authorized payments abroad. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be declared within eight days from the date of collection. They may either be surrendered or be deposited with an authorized bank and subsequently are used in the same way as proceeds accruing from exports. Persons entering Austria may bring in Austrian or foreign bank notes and coin without limit. Capital The acquisition by nonresidents of Austrian securities, shares, and participations in Austrian companies, and Austrian real estate is covered by a general license. In certain provinces, the acquisition of real estate is, how- ever, subject to the approval of the local authorities. Direct investments by nonresidents, except in the form of loans for nonproductive purposes (unless loans are granted at preferential terms and do not exceed three times the paid-up equity of the lender), are also permitted by general authorization, if made with convertible cur- rencies or from free or originally owned blocked schilling balances; for inves tmen ts financed in other ways, au- thorization is granted on the merits of each case. Foreign banks cannot establish branches in Austria, except through an enterprise incorporated in Austria. Nonresidents are also not permitted to invest in the 3 The requ irement was abolished, w i th effect from January 1, 1988. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution auditing, mining, energy, transport, or legal sectors, and they are not permitted to acquire a share of 25 percent or more in ships registered in Austria. Loans and credits extended by nonresidents to resi- dents, including those in schillings from Free Schilling Accounts, at present require prior approval by the Na- tional Bank and, in many cases, are restricted. Approvals are granted generally, but not exclusively, for (1) invest- ment credits for productive enterprises, (2) import and export finance, and (3) loans from nonresident relatives to residents. Import credit with a maturity customary in the trade concerned is licensed freely. The short-term foreign assets and liabilities of autho- rized banks in convertible currencies are not subject to limitation. The National Bank licenses financial loans with maturities of more than one year to nonresidents only to the extent of funds made available through the redemption of such loans outstanding at the end of December of the previous year, plus an additional amount. Mortgage loans, export finance credits, and loans to Austrian subsidiaries abroad are not subject to this limit. A number of authorized banks are permitted to accept deposits in convertible currencies from abroad for inter- bank on-lending abroad at maturities of up to five years. Major banks are permitted to borrow from nonresidents in foreign currency over the medium and long term. Transactions and operations mentioned in the following three paragraphs are licensed upon documentation, pro- vided that they are concluded with residents of countries that are members of the IMF or the OECD. The National Bank permits the transfer abroad of (1) proceeds from the liquidation of various foreign invest- ments in Austria (shares or participations in Austrian enterprises, Austrian securities, and real estate in Aus- tria); and (2) repayments by residents of foreign loans and credits. The transfer of funds owned by emigrants and payments due to nonresidents on account of dowries, inheritances, and settlements under certain agreements between heirs are permitted. Residents may also grant loans to nonres- ident relatives, provided that the lender draws on his own resources. Residents are allowed, for purposes of direct invest- ment, to acquire participation rights in foreign companies, associations, and other enterprises, and to establish, acquire, or extend foreign agencies or individually owned firms; earnings accruing from such investment usually may be reinvested. Residents also are permitted to acquire real estate abroad for the purpose of establishing a secondary residence that is intended for the personal use of the buyer within one year, to grant commercial or investment credits (provided that, in the latter case, the proceeds of the credit are used within Austria), to grant direct investment loans (provided that the resident can actually exert influence on the management of the non- resident enterprise), and to grant credits secured by mortgages in Austria or abroad. Domestic banks may grant short-term foreign currency loans to nonresidents against collateral in securities, if the proceeds are to be AUSTRIA used either for the purchase of securities to be deposited as collateral with the lending institution or, after conver- sion into Austrian schillings, for authorized payments to residents. Domestic insurance companies may conclude life insurance contracts in Austria with nonresidents. Residents are allowed to purchase from nonresidents, without restriction, Austrian securities and foreign se- curities issued in member countries of the IMF or the OECD with which settlements take place in convertible currencies and which are quoted in an official securities market;4 for foreign securities and Austrian external bonds, the transactions must be carried out on a spot basis through authorized banks and, with certain excep- tions (e.g., in the case of securities listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange), the securities purchased must be kept with such banks. Payments for these purchases to non- residents may be made in convertible currencies. Resi- dents may sell foreign securities and Austrian external bonds to nonresidents only on a spot basis against payment in convertible currencies and, for securities deposited with Austrian authorized banks, only through such banks. Gold Transactions in gold (excluding jewelry and medallions, which are considered jewelry) are governed by the Foreign Exchange Law. The National Bank is authorized by this law to deal in gold as defined therein; the Bank has granted a number of general permissions widely liberal- izing the domestic gold trade, but does not itself buy or sell gold or gold coin, except in transactions with monetary authorities of other countries or with international finan- cial institutions. The Bank has authorized credit institu- tions, exchange offices, and coin dealers to buy or sell in Austria on their own behalf or on behalf of their customers (including nonresidents) gold coin that is not legal tender; the prices are based on those for coin and unmanufactured gold in free markets abroad. A general license also permits other residents to purchase and sell among themselves, in Austria, and against payment in schillings gold coin that is not legal tender. The Mint releases certain types of gold coin (restrikes) to authorized credit institutions for resale to the public. It has also issued a commemorative gold coin with a face value of S 1,000, which is legal tender. Residents may hold gold in any form, including bars, in Austria, and they may acquire in Austria any gold coin that is not legal tender and any gold medals or medallions; furthermore, domestic trading between residents in gold with a fineness of less than 0.585 is unrestricted. With the exception of coin, medals, and gold with a fineness of less than 0.585, the acquisition from residents of gold subject to the Foreign Exchange Law is reserved for the monetary authorities, authorized industrial users, dentists, and 4 The general license does not apply to the purchase by residents from nonresidents of securities of a participating nature in whatever legal form (including shares) that are issued by foreign investment funds or by similar institutions of whatever kind that assemble assets for the purpose of risk spreading. Individual licenses are issued automatically when the purchase takes place on a recognized foreign stock exchange or when the issuing institution is subject to adequate surveillance. 83 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRIA jewelers; the Mint, gold refiners, and jewelers are per- mitted to trade or exchange gold in any form among themselves. Domestic sales of gold coins that are not legal tender (and thus tax free) are subject to a value- added tax of 20 percent. Where the Foreign Trade Law prescribes import li- censes for gold imports (e.g., for gold sheets), the license is issued either by the Ministry for Economic Affairs to industrial users or by the customs office concerned, which issues licenses automatically for certain gold imports within its jurisdiction. Where this law does not require an import license (e.g., for the import of gold bars), the Foreign Exchange Law prescribes a license issued by the National Bank covering the purchase of gold. Exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require authorization by the National Bank; the Bank has issued a general license permitting nonresident travelers to take out coin that is not legal tender up to a weight of 200 grams a person a trip and allowing resident travelers to specified member countries to export such coin up to a value of S 10,000 a person a trip. The National Bank's imports and exports do not require import, exchange, or export licenses. Commercial imports of jewelry and of articles containing a minor amount of gold, such as watches, are liberalized, licenses being issued automatically by the customs authorities; commercial exports of a number of such articles, however, must be licensed by the Ministry for Economic Affairs. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 84 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution THE BAHAMAS (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of The Bahamas is the Bahamian Dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the in terven t ion currency, at B$l = US$1. The U.S. dollar circulates concurrently with the Bahamian dollar. The official buy ing and selling rates for the U.S. dollar are B$1.0025 and B$1.0040, respectively, per US$1. Buy ing and selling rates for the pound sterling are also officially quoted, the buying rate being based on the New York market midrate, and the selling rate, 0.5 percent above the buy ing rate. The Central Bank of The Bahamas deals only with commercial banks. For transactions w i th the public, commercial banks are authorized to charge a commission of 0.50 percent buy ing and 0.75 percent selling, per US$1, and 0.50 percent buying or selling per £ stg. 1. These charges are additional to the Central Bank's charges. A stamp tax of B$0.10 is applied to all outward remittances when the amount is B$30 or less. A fu r ther tax of B$0.10 is levied on every additional B$30 or fraction thereof. There is also a market in which " inves tment currency"1 may be negotiated between residents through an invest- ment currency dealer at freely determined rates, usually attracting a premium over the official market rate. The Bahamas formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from December 5, 1973. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank, which delegates to authorized dealers the au thor i ty to approve allocations of foreign exchange for certain current payments; the approval authority for import paymen ts, travel facilities, and cash gifts is not delegated, except in Grand Bahama and the Family Islands. Import and export licenses are not required except for crawf ish, conch, arms and ammunition, and, in certain cases, industrial gold. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries issues export licenses for crawfish and conch, and the Police Depart- ment issues import and export licenses for arms and ammunition. Prescription of Currency The exchange control system of The Bahamas makes no distinction between foreign territories. Settlements with residents of foreign countries may be made in any 1 This is foreign currency in respect of wh ich there is general or specific central bank permission that it may be retained and used or disposed of as investment currency.

The use of investment currency is prescribed for the purchase from nonresidents of foreign currency securities and the mak ing of direct inves tmen ts outside The Bahamas. foreign currency2 or in Bahamian dollars through an External Account. Nonresident Accounts Authorized banks may freely open External Accounts denominated in Bahamian dollars for winter residents and for persons with residency permits who are not gainfully employed in The Bahamas. With the prior approval of the Central Bank, authorized banks may also open Ex- ternal Accounts in Bahamian dollars for nonresident companies that have local expenses in The Bahamas and for nonresident investors. External Accounts in Bahamian dollars are normally funded entirely from foreign currency originating outside The Bahamas, but income on regis- tered inves tmen ts may also be credited to these accounts w i th the Central Bank 's approval. Balances may be converted freely into foreign currency and transferred abroad.3 Accounts which are credited with funds that may not be placed at the free disposal of nonresidents are desig- nated Blocked Accounts. These are held mainly by emigrants. Where the value of an emigrant's assets exceeds B$25,000, the excess is credited to a Blocked Account. Balances on Blocked Accounts are transferable through the official exchange market after four years or through the inves tment currency market at any time; they may also be invested, with the Central Bank's approval, in certain resident-held assets or be spent locally for any other purpose. Imports and Import Payments The importation of certain commodities is prohibited or controlled because of health, social, or humanitarian reasons. All other goods may be imported without a license. The prior approval of the Central Bank is required for making payments for imports, irrespective of origin;4 this approval is normally given automatically upon sub- mission of pro forma invoices or other relevant documents proving the existence of a purchase contract. Import duties vary from zero to 200 percent, depending on the type of good. Customs entries are subject to a stamp tax at a rate of 1.5 percent. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on current payments. Au- thorized dealers can make payments to nonresidents on behalf of residents for certain services and other invisibles within specified limits. Such payments include freight, 2 Foreign currencies comprise all currencies other than the Bahamian dollar. 3 Persons of foreign nationality who have been granted "temporary resident" status are treated in some respects as nonresidents but are not permitted to hold External Accounts in Bahamian dollars. 4 Except in Grand Bahama and the Family Islands, where this authority is delegated to clearing bank branches. 85 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution THE BAHAMAS ships' disbursements, commissions, royalties, education, and insurance payments. Residents are entitled, on ap- plication to the Central Bank, to a foreign currency travel allowance of the equivalent of B$ 1,000 a person a year for tourist travel and of B$5,000 a person a year for genuine business or professional travel. The allowance of B$ 1,000 for tourist travel excludes the cost of fares and travel services, which are normally obtained against payment in Bahamian dollars to a travel agent in The Bahamas. Applications for foreign exchange in excess of these amounts must be referred to the Central Bank, which approves bona fide applications. Foreign exchange facilities obtained for travel may not be retained abroad or be used abroad for purposes other than travel; any unused balance must be surrendered within a week of issue or, if the traveler is still abroad, within one week of his return to The Bahamas. Subject to adequate documentary evidence, an edu- cation allowance of up to B$10,000 a person an academic year is normally granted upon application. Applications for facilities in excess of this amount are referred to the Central Bank. Temporary residents may, with the ap- proval of the Central Bank, remit up to 50 percent of their wages and salaries, but where commitments outside The Bahamas are larger than 50 percent of wages and salaries, additional amounts may be remitted. Temporary residents may also repatriate all of their accumulated savings resulting from their employment in The Bahamas. A traveler may take out Bahamian banknotes not exceeding B$70 in value; Bahamian travelers may not take out notes of any other country, except with the specific approval of the Central Bank. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are not required except for crawfish, conch, and arms and ammunition. The proceeds of exports must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer as soon as the goods have reached their destination or within six months of shipment; alternatively, export proceeds may be used in any manner acceptable to the Central Bank. Proceeds from Invisibles Residents are obliged to collect without delay all amounts due to them from nonresidents and to offer the foreign currency proceeds for sale to an authorized dealer without delay, but these requirements are seldom enforced. There are no restrictions on the import of foreign bank notes. The import of domestic bank notes is subject to the approval of the Central Bank. Capital All capital transfers to countries outside The Bahamas require exchange control approval, and outflows of resident-owned capital are restricted. Inward transfers do not require exchange control approval, although the subsequent utilization of the funds in The Bahamas may require authorization. The permission of the Central Bank is required in respect of any action whereby nonresidents acquire control of or participate in an incorporated com- 86 pany controlled by residents. Resident individuals and companies require the specific permission of the Central Bank to maintain foreign currency bank accounts.5 The use of official exchange for direct investment abroad is limited to B$100,000 or 30 percent of the total cost of the investment, whichever is greater, for invest- ments from which the additional benefits expected to accrue to the balance of payments from export receipts, profits, or other earnings within 18 months of the invest- ment wjJJ at least equal the total amount of investment and will continue thereafter. Investments abroad that do not meet the above criteria may be financed by foreign currency borrowed on suitable terms subject to individual approval by the Central Bank, the purchase of foreign currency in the investment currency market, or the use of retained profits of foreign subsidiary companies. Per- mission is not given for investments that are likely to have adverse effects on the balance of payments. In principle, inward investment by nonresidents is unrestricted. However, the consent of the Central Bank is required for the issue or transfer of shares in a Bahamian company to a nonresident and for the transfer of control of a Bahamian company to a nonresident. Special pro- cedures apply to investments in the form of purchase of real property, as specified under the Immovable Property (Acquisition by Foreign Persons) Act, 1981, which came into effect on November 1, 1983: foreigners intending to purchase land must make application to the Foreign Investments Board, a group of designated ministers of the Government. If such application is approved, payment for the purchase may be made either in Bahamian dollars from an External Account or in foreign currency. For all investments with approved status, permission is given upon application for the transfer of profits and dividends representing earned trading profits and invest- ment income. In the event of a sale or liquidation, nonresident investors are permitted to repatriate the proceeds, including any capital appreciation, through the official foreign exchange market. Residents require the specific approval of the Central Bank to buy property outside The Bahamas; such pur- chases, if for personal use, can be made only with investment currency, and approval is limited to one property for each family. Any incidental expenses con- nected with the purchase of property for personal use may normally be met w i th inves tment currency; expendi- tures necessary for the maintenance of the property or arising directly from its ownership may, with permission, be met with foreign currency bought at the current market rate in the official foreign exchange market. The transfer of legacies and inheritances due to non- resident beneficiaries under wills or intestacies of persons who were Bahamian residents at the time of their death is permitted. However, permission is not normally given for Bahamian residents to settle any property, other than by will, for the benefit of nonresidents, in line with the 5 Banks and trus ts established in The Bahamas are exempt from certain exchange control regulations, particularly with regard to their offshore operations. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution provisions of the Immovable Property (Acquisition by Foreign Persons) Act, 1981. A resident may make cash gifts to nonresidents not exceeding a total of B$ 1,000 a donor each year. This amount may be exceeded, with permission, in special circumstances. Foreign nationals domiciled in The Bahamas, even if considered resident for exchange control purposes, may be eligible for a measure of exemption from certain exchange control obligations, notably with respect to the mandatory deposit of foreign currency securities and the surrender of certain other foreign capital assets. Nonresident buyers of Bahamian securities must pay for such purchases in Bahamian dollars from an External Account, in funds eligible for credit to an External Account, or in Bahamian dollars arising from the sale of foreign currency in the official foreign exchange market; interest, dividends, and capital payments on such secu- rities may not be remitted outside The Bahamas unless the holdings have been properly acquired by nonresidents. Bahamian residents are not permitted to purchase foreign currency securities with official exchange or out of export proceeds or other current earnings; payment must be made with investment currency. All purchases, sales, and switches of foreign currency securities in The Bahamas and all switches in foreign currency securities by Baha- mian residents, wherever the switch takes place, require permission from the Central Bank, and all transactions must take place through authorized agents.6 All foreign securities purchased by residents of The Bahamas must be held by or to the order of an authorized agent. Securities of other former Sterling Area countries are considered foreign currency securities, and sales proceeds of such securities held by residents, if registered at the Central Bank by December 31, 1972, are eligible for sale in the investment currency market; securities not so registered may be offered for sale at the official rate of exchange. Residents leaving the country with the intention of residing permanently outside The Bahamas are redesig- nated upon departure as nonresidents. Under normal rules persons leaving The Bahamas to take up residence elsewhere may transfer, at the current market rate in the official foreign exchange market, up to B$25,000 of their Bahamian dollar assets to the new country of residence, and may also take normal household and personal effects with them. When the total value of their Bahamian dollar assets is over B$25,000, the excess is transferable through the official exchange market after four years, or through the investment currency market at any time. After a person's redesignation as a nonresident, income accruing from his assets remaining in The Bahamas is normally remittable at the current market rate in the official foreign exchange market. 6 There are 12 banks and trust companies authorized to deal in Bahamian and foreign currency securities and to receive securities in deposit. THE BAHAMAS Residents other than authorized banks require permis- sion to borrow foreign currency from nonresidents, and authorized dealers are subject to exchange control direc- tions with regard to their lending of foreign currency to residents. Residents also require permission to pay inter- est on, and to repay the principal of, foreign currency loans by conversion of Bahamian dollars. When permis- sion is granted for residents to accept foreign currency loans, such permission is normally conditional upon the currency being offered for sale without delay to an authorized dealer, unless the funds are required to meet payments to nonresidents for which permission has been specifically given. A resident company that is wholly owned by nonresi- dents is not normally allowed to raise working capital in Bahamian dollars unless such funds are a small proportion of the total investment. If the company is partly owned by residents, the amount of such local currency borrowing is normally determined in relation to the resident interest in the equity of the company. Banks and other lenders resident in The Bahamas require permission before they extend loans in domestic currency to any corporate body (other than a bank), which is resident in The Bahamas and is controlled by any means, whether directly or indirectly, by nonresidents. However, companies that are set up by nonresidents primarily to import and distribute products manufactured outside The Bahamas are not normally allowed to borrow Bahamian dollars from res- idents either for fixed or working capital but must provide all their finance in foreign currency; borrowings in a foreign currency normally are permitted on application. Gold Residents of The Bahamas other than authorized dealers are not permitted to hold or deal in gold bullion. Those residents, however, who are known users of gold for industrial purposes may, with the approval of the Central Bank, meet their current industrial requirements. Au- thorized dealers are not required to obtain licenses for bullion or coin. Commercial imports of gold jewelry do not require a license. There is no import duty on gold bullion or gold coin; however, an import du ty of 35 percent is imposed on imports of gold jewelry from all sources. A 1.5 percent stamp tax payable to customs is also payable on commercial shipments of gold jewelry from any source. There is no restriction on the acquisition or retention by residents of gold coin. The Bahamas has issued commemorative coins in denominations of B$10, B$20, B$50, B$100, B$150, B$200, B$250, B$l,000, and B$2,500 in gold, and B$10 and B$25 in silver; these are legal tender but do not circulate. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 87 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BAHRAIN (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Bahrain is the Bahrain Dinar, which is pegged to the SDR at the rate of BD 0.476190 = SDR 1. The exchange rate for the Bahrain dinar in terms of the SDR may be set within margins of plus or m inus 7.25 percent of this fixed relationship. In practice, how- ever, the Bahrain dinar has maintained a relatively stable relationship with the U.S. dollar, the intervention cur- rency, and since December 1980, the exchange rate has remained unchanged at BD 1 = US$2.6596. With the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major cur- rencies in the early 1980s, the exchange rate of the dinar in terms of the SDR remained outside the 7.25 percent margin throughout the period May 1981-June 1986. The exchange rate of the dinar in terms of the SDR returned to within the 7.25 percent margin in July 1986 and remained within this margin at end-December 1987. The middle rate of the Bahrain dinar for the U.S. dollar quoted by the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) is adjusted from time to time. The Agency also quotes daily rates for the pound sterling and the deutsche mark based on the latest available rates for the U.S. dollar against those currencies. On December 31, 1987 the Agency's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were BD 0.375 and BD 0.377, respectively, per US$1. The Agency does not deal with the public. In their dealings with the public, commercial banks are required to use the Agency's rates for U.S. dollars, pounds sterling, and deutsche mark, but they are authorized to charge an exchange commission of 2 per mill (special rates of commission apply for transactions up to BD 1,000). The banks' rates for other currencies are based on the Agency's rates for the U.S. dollar and the New York market rate for the currency concerned against the U.S. dollar. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Bahrain formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from March 20, 1973. Administration of Control The Agency is the exchange control au thor i ty, but there is no exchange control legislation in Bahrain. No import or export licenses are required (except for arms and ammunition, television cameras, and alcoholic bever- ages). However, importers and exporters must be regis- tered with the commercial registry maintained by the Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture and must be members of the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Indu s t ry. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel are prohibited. Otherwise, no requirements are imposed on exchange paymen ts or receipts. 88 Nonresident Accounts A distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. Offshore bank- ing units are not normally permitted to hold resident accounts. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel are prohibited, as are products manufactured by foreign companies that are blacklisted by the League of Arab States. Imports of a few com- modities are prohibited from all sources for reasons of health, public policy, or security. Imports of cultured pearls also are prohibited. Import licenses are required for arms and ammun i t ion, television cameras, and alco- holic beverages. Rice and sugar are, in practice, imported only by the Bahrain Import-Export Company. Exchange for payments in respect of permitted imports may be obtained freely. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel are prohibited, and exports of certain refined petroleum products to South Africa have been suspended. Otherwise, all commodities may be exported freely. There are no requirements attached to receipts from exports or re-exports; the proceeds need not be repatriated or surrendered, and they may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for and proceeds from invisibles are not restricted, except that payments must not be made to or received from Israel. Travelers may bring in or take out of Bahrain any amount in domestic or foreign bank notes. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or paymen ts by residents or nonresidents, but paymen ts may not be made to or received from Israel. Profits from foreign inves tmen ts in Bahrain may be transferred abroad freely, w i th the exception that under Article 72 of the Monetary Agency Law the banks are subject to special rules regarding the payment of dividends and the remittance of their profits. Licensed offshore banking un i ts may freely engage in transactions with nonresidents; transactions w i th residents are not normally permitted. The M in is try of Commerce and Agriculture operates a center for the dissemination of information on the stock exchange. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution gold in any form are freely permitted and do not require a license. Imports of gold jewelry are subject to a 10 percent customs duty but gold ingots are exempt. Brokerage business in gold (as well as other commodities) requires approval from the Bahrain Monetary Agency before registering with the Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture; such business is subject to a m in imum deposit requirement equivalent in the case of gold to BD 3,000, or 10 percent of the contract value, whichever is higher.

Not for Redistribution BANGLADESH (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Bangladesh is the Bangladesh Taka. The value of the taka in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is determined with reference to a weighted basket of currencies. On December 31, 1987 the official (spot) middle rate of the taka in terms of the U.S. dollar was Tk 31.20 = US$1. On December 31, 1987 the spot buying and selling rates of the Bangladesh Bank (the central bank) for authorized dealers were Tk 31.17 and Tk 31.23, respectively, per US$1. On the same date, the spot buying and selling rates (telegraphic transfers) of authorized dealers were Tk 31.1387 and Tk 31.2613, respectively, per US$1. Exchange rates for currencies other than the U.S. dollar are based on the daily closing rates of the U.S. dollar in New York for the currencies concerned. Different effective exchange rates arise from the operation of the Secondary Exchange Market (SEM), which comprises the Wage Earners' Scheme (WES) and the Export Per- formance Benefit (XPB) Scheme. Under the WES, foreign exchange earnings remitted by workers abroad, tourist receipts, and most service receipts are sold at a rate determined by a committee of authorized foreign exchange dealers (mainly banks) and the Bangladesh Bank. Under the XPB scheme, exporters and certain indirect exporters of nontraditional items are eligible to receive an exchange rate premium, which is set to equal the difference between the WES rate (in taka per U.S. dollar) and the official rate. Each eligible item receives a coefficient of either 40 percent, 70 percent, or 100 percent of the XPB, depending on that item's domestic value added and the priority that the Government places on encouraging its export. At the end of 1987, 72 items were eligible for 100 percent of the XPB, covering domestic value added of 70 percent and above. A coefficient of 70 percent was given to 37 items, which covered items with a value added of between 50 percent and 69 percent. Exports of garments and leather were subject to a schedule of coefficients. To encourage backward integration, these items received 40 percent XPB if they were made from imported raw materials, and 100 percent XPB if domestic materials were used. Also, 70 percent XPB was paid both on exports of intermediate textile products (i.e., fabric) and on domestic sales of intermediate products that were finished locally and then exported. All other exports receive 40 percent XPB, except raw jute and wet-blue leather. On December 31, 1987 the middle exchange rate in the secondary market was Tk 32.925 per US$1 and T k 6 1 . 1 8 5 p e r £ s t g. 1.

The authorized banks may in their turn take forward cover in the interbank market or from the Bangladesh Bank against transactions for which they have entered into forward contracts with their customers. Authorized banks may also take forward cover for one month from the Bangladesh Bank against sight export bills negotiated by them, and enter into forward contracts with their overseas branches/correspondents against underlying export or import transactions. Au- thorized banks are permitted to retain relatively small working balances with their foreign correspondents, and currency swaps are not permitted unless they are against underlying approved commercial transactions. Forward transactions of the Bangladesh Bank are confined to purchases and sales of deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, U.S. dollars, and all currencies of the member countries of the ACU. Upon payment of an annual premium of 2.5 percent, the exchange risk on public or private foreign currency loans that will be fully or partly disbursed by June 30, 1988 through Development Finance Institutions and na- tionalized commercial banks may be given forward ex- change cover under the Exchange Rate Fluctuation Bur- den Absorption Scheme. The fu ll amount of the exchange risk may be covered in respect of loans disbursed after July 1, 1983, but the scheme applies to only a specified proportion of loans fully disbursed prior to that date. The scheme also permits lending institutions to convert into preferred shares or debentures a part of exchange losses on foreign currency loans outstanding on June 30, 1983 and on which there are overdue payments. The scheme is administered by the Bangladesh Bank, but the exchange risk is borne by the Government. Premiums received against the covers are credited to a special government account. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bangladesh Bank in accordance with general policy formulated in consultation with the Ministry of Finance. The seven foreign and ten domestic commercial banks (of which three are nationalized), together with two joint-venture banks and three specialized financial institutions, have been appointed authorized dealers (authorized banks) in foreign exchange. The Chief Controller of Imports and Exports of the Ministry of Commerce is responsible for registration of exporters and importers and for issuance of the Import Policy Order (IPO). Registered importers can make their imports in terms of the IPO against letters of credit. Letters of credit authorization forms are issued by authorized dealers and a separate import license is not required. Certain trade transactions are conducted through ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution state-trading agencies, including the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB). Prescription of Currency Settlements with all countries are subject to exchange control. Settlements with countries with which Bangla- desh has commodity exchange agreements2 normally must be effected through nonconvertible U.S. dollar or pound sterling accounts for goods and services specified in the agreements up to agreed value limits; settlement with these countries can be made in convertible currencies for goods and services not specified in the agreements or beyond the value ceilings specified in the agreements. Payments to, and receipts from, the other member coun- tries of the ACU in respect of current transactions must be effected in Asian Monetary Un i ts (AMU) through the Clearing Union .3 Settlements with other countries nor- mally take place in sterling and other convertible curren- cies and, in a few cases, through Nonresident Taka Accounts. Payments for imports may be made to the country of origin of the goods or to any other country (with the exception of those countries from which im- portation is prohibited); they may be made (1) in taka for credit to a nonresident bank account in Bangladesh of the country concerned; (2) in the currency of the country concerned; or (3) in any freely convertible currency. Export proceeds must be received in freely convertible foreign exchange or in taka from a Nonresident Taka Account. All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The accounts of individuals, firms, or companies resi- dent in countries outside Bangladesh are designated Nonresident Accounts. All such accounts are regarded for exchange control purposes as accounts related to the country in which the account holder is a permanent resident.4 Nonresident Foreign Currency Accounts may be opened by authorized dealers without prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank in respect of Bangladesh nationals/ foreign nationals who reside abroad and in respect of foreign firms operating abroad. Specified debits and cred- its to Nonresident Accounts may be made by authorized dealers without the prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank during the absence of the account holder from Bangladesh. Certain other debits and credits may be made without the prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank but are subject to reporting ex post. Convertible Taka Accounts. All diplomatic missions operating in Bangladesh, their diplomatic officers, home- based members of the mission staffs, international non- profit humanitarian organizations functioning in Bangla- 2 Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, German Dem- ocratic Republic, Hungary, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Poland, Romania, U.S.S.R., and Yugoslavia. 3 Exchange rates for transactions under the ACU are calculated and announced on the basis of daily IMF quotations of the exchange rates of the currencies of the ACU member countries in terms of SDRs. 4 The accounts of the United Nations and its agencies are treated as resident accounts. BANGLADESH desh and their expatriate employees, foreign contractors and consultants engaged in specific projects, and foreign nationals residing in Bangladesh regardless of their status are allowed to maintain Convertible Taka Accounts. These accounts may be credited freely with the proceeds of inward remittances in convertible foreign exchange and may be debited freely and at any time for local disbursements in taka, as well as for remittances abroad in convertible currencies. Transfers between Convertible Taka Accounts are freely permitted. Foreign missions and embassies may open interest-bearing accounts, but the interest earned thereon can be disbursed only in local currency. Wage Earners' Scheme. Under the WES, Bangladesh nationals and persons of Bangladesh origin who are working abroad are permitted to open Foreign Currency Accounts denominated in pounds sterling or U.S. dollars. These accounts may be credited with (1) remittances in convertible currencies received from abroad through normal banking and postal channels; (2) proceeds of convertible currencies (currency notes, traveler's checks, drafts, etc.) brought into Bangladesh by the account holders, provided they were declared to customs upon arrival in Bangladesh; (3) transfers from other Foreign Currency Accounts opened under the WES; and (4) transfers from nonresident foreign currency deposit ac- counts. The accounts may be debited, without restriction, but subject to reporting to the Bangladesh Bank, for the following purposes: (1) all local disbursements; (2) trans- fers to other Foreign Currency Accounts opened under the WES; (3) payment for imports of specified goods against letters of credit; (4) payment of bank commissions and other bank charges connected with the handling of the accounts; and (5) travel expenditures abroad for business or private purposes up to prescribed limits. For travel on private purposes, the upper limit is the equivalent of US$400 per person a year (regardless of the number of visits annually) for travel by air to Bhutan, Burma, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka (but up to US$150 for overland travel to India); and US$1,800 per person a year and a maximum of US$1,000 per trip for travel to other countries. Nonresident Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts. Bangladesh nationals, foreign nationals, and foreign firms may also open interest-bearing Nonresident Foreign Cur- rency Deposit Accounts, denominated in pounds sterling or U.S. dollars. These accounts, whose terms range from one month to one year, may be credited, in initial minimum amounts of US$1,000 or £ stg. 500, (US$25,000 for foreigners) with (1) remittances in convertible currencies, and (2) transfers from existing Foreign Currency Accounts maintained under the WES. The banks pay interest on balances in these accounts at Eurocurrency deposit rates. The balance, including interest earned, may be transferred in foreign exchange by the account holder to his country of residence or anywhere he chooses; the account holder, if he is not otherwise ineligible under the WES, may also transfer the balance to any Foreign Currency Account maintained under the WES. The balances in the accounts, 91 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BANGLADESH which are freely convertible into taka at the official rate, must be reported by banks monthly to the Bangladesh Bank and the accounts must be closed within six mon ths or on maturity of the deposit, whichever is later, upon the taking up of permanent residence by the account holder in Bangladesh. Imports and Import Payments Imports are financed either from Bangladesh's own resources or with foreign aid, loans, and barter arrange- ments. Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohib- ited. Imports other than foodgrains, fertilizers, and items financed by project aid are licensed within the framework of an annual import policy (import budget). The IPO for the fiscal year 1987/88 (July to June) is based on two lists, the negative list and the restricted list. The negative list includes items in 355 out of 1,012 categories at the Import Trade Control (ITC) four-digit level, for which importation is totally banned either for social or religious reasons or because similar items are locally produced. The IPO prohibits or restricts imports of some raw materials or inpu ts, certain textiles, factory rejects, goods of substand- ard quality, used items, and materials inimical to public order or religious beliefs. The Restricted List includes items in 261 categories that may be imported only if certain conditions relating mainly to nature of end users and quality standards are met. In addition, there are special restricted lists for the ju te mills, textile mills, and importers of G.P. sheet. Items not on these lists are freely importable through the SEM, provided that the importer has a valid import registration certificate, which is readily obtainable. Imports at the official exchange rate are subject to allocation on the basis of foreign exchange availability. Cash allocations at the official exchange rate are granted for the importation of, inter alia, technology, certain spare parts and machinery, and special materials and equipment for certain export-oriented sectors. With the exception of imports by government depart- ments, letter of credit authorization forms (LCAFs) are required of all registered importers for all imports. Under the authority of the IPO issued by the Chief Controller, registered commercial importers are allowed to effect imports against LCAFs issued by authorized dealer banks without the need for an import license. For imports under the SEM Scheme, an importer is required to have a valid import registration certificate either as a commercial importer or industrial consumer or under the SEM Scheme. These documents are issued by a licensing office of the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports. Single country LCAFs are issued for imports under bilateral trade or payments agreements and for imports under tied aid programs. LCAFs are valid worldwide, except that im- ports from Israel and South Africa and imports transported on the flag vessels of Israel and South Africa are prohib- ited. For shipment of imports under cash and the SEM Scheme, the validity of LCAFs is as follows: (1) 11 months from the date of issuance/registration of an LCAF for commercial items and industrial raw and packing materials; and (2) 17 months from the date of issuance/ 92 registration of an LCAF for the importation of capital machinery and spare parts. If these documents lapse for reasons beyond the control of the importer, they may be re validated by the licensing au thor i ty. Authorized dealers may, subsequent to the month of registration of the above documents, allow remittances within a period of 12 months for the importation of commercial items and industrial raw materials and packing materials and up to 18 months for the importation of capital machinery and spare parts. If the importers require additional time to make remit- tances, then authorized dealers may allow such remit- tances only under the SEM Scheme. Payment against imports is generally permissible only under cover of irrevocable letters of credit. Under the SEM Scheme, a provision exists for the importation of machinery and equipment against letters of credit opened on a deferred payment basis for up to 360 days. Raw materials may be imported under letters of credit on a deferred payment basis up to 180 days. Recognized export-oriented ready-made garments and specialized textile and hosiery un i ts operating under the bonded warehouse system may effect imports of their raw and packing materials by opening letters of credit on a deferred payment basis up to 180 days against export letters of credit received by them. Opening of letters of credit for industrial imports and specified essential commercial imports in the private sector is subject to margin require- ments in domestic currency ranging from 5 percent to 15 percent; for nonessential commercial imports, the m in imum margin requ i remen ts range from 25 percent to 75 percent. Before establishing sight letters of credit for imports in the SEM, fu ll foreign exchange cover must be deposited in the case of commercial imports, and at least 50 percent must be deposited in the case of industrial imports. The advance foreign exchange deposit require- ment does not apply to imports at the SEM rate financed out of the SDR 147.80 million Industrial Sector Credit No. 1816 BD of International Development Association (IDA). There is no m in imum margin requirement for opening of import letters of credit for raw and packaging materials against export letters of credit received by export-oriented ready-made garment un i t s. For public sector importers, the m in imum margin requ irement for opening letters of credit is 5 percent. Imports of books and periodicals up to specified limits are permissible on a consignment basis. Public sector importers, however, may import on a cash-against-documents basis, subject to authorization by the Bangladesh Bank. Imports of specified raw materials and packing materials by industrial consumers is subject to the availability of funds and governed by an en t i t lement sys tem, based on the requ iremen ts for various indus tr ies dur ing each import program period as established by the Director-General of Indus tr ies. Firms in the indus tr ial sector are given an en t i t lement for impor ta t ion of specified raw materials and packing materials, and letter of credit authorization forms are issued on the basis of the en t i t lemen t. The en t i t lement system does not app ly, however, to raw materials and packing materials that are imported under the SEM ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Scheme, although these imports are subject to quan t i ta t ive restrictions if they appear on the Restricted List. Sepa- rately, indus tr ial consumers may be issued w i th LCAFs for parts and accessories of mach inery. Goods imported against LCAFs issued to industrial consumers must be used in the indu s t ry concerned and must not be sold or transferred w i thout prior approval. Foreign exchange for authorized imports is provided automatically by authorized dealers when paymen ts are due. Advance payments for imports require approval by the Bangladesh Bank, wh ich normally is given only for specialized or capital goods. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles connected w i th authorized trade transactions are generally not restricted. Payments for most o ther inv is ib les require prior approval and are restricted. Applications for foreign exchange for bus iness travel, medical t rea tmen t, and education abroad are considered on an individual basis. Exporters w i th export earnings of Tk 100 million or more during the preceding year are en t i t led to a max imum business travel allowance of US$25,000 a year. Exporters with export earnings of Tk 50 million to Tk 100 million in the preceding year are en t i t led to the allowance equ iv- alent to 1 percent of the f.o.b. value of their exports, subject to a max imum of US$18,000. Those w i th export earnings of Tk 2.5 million to Tk 50 million are also entitled to the allowance equ iva lent to 1 percent of the f .o .b. value of their exports, subject to a m in imum of US$4,500 and a max imum of US$11,000; exporters w i th a perfor- mance of less than Tk 2.5 million are allowed up to US$4,500. New exporters are allowed US$90 per day, subject to a max imum of US$3,000. All business travel allowance must be purchased in the SEM. For medical treatment the amount granted is the actual requirement, which must be purchased in the SEM, subject to the consent of the Bangladesh Bank. A Bangladesh national proceeding abroad by air is allowed to purchase foreign exchange from a Foreign Currency Account under the WES, subject to certain limits (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above). Foreign nationals working in Bangla- desh must obtain approval before making remittances abroad for family maintenance; such approval is usually granted for up to 50 percent of net salaries, subject to a maximum of £ stg. 200 a mon th (net of tax), if the terms of employment have been approved by the Gove rnmen t. Nonresident travelers may take out the foreign currency and traveler's checks they declared on entry less the amount sold to authorized dealers or money changers; they may also, w i thout obtaining the approval of the Bangladesh Bank, reconvert taka notes up to Tk 6,000 into convertible foreign currencies at the time of their exit; if no declaration has been made, up to US$150 may be reconverted. Resident travelers may take out foreign currency and traveler's checks up to the amount of any travel allocation they have been granted. A Bangladeshi or a foreign national may take out Tk 100 in domestic BANGLADESH currency; otherwise, the export of Bangladesh currency notes and coin is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. The proceeds from exports must be received w i th in four mon ths of sh ipmen t. Exports of ju te and ju te goods must be registered with the Bangladesh Bank. Proceeds from Invisibles All proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered, but Bangladeshi nationals working abroad may retain their earnings in Foreign Currency Accounts or in Nonresident Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts. Unless specifically exempted by the Bangladesh Bank, all Bangladeshi na- tionals who are resident in Bangladesh must surrender any foreign exchange coming into their possession, whether held in Bangladesh or abroad, to an authorized dealer w i th in one mon th of the date of acquisition. Foreign nationals residing in Bangladesh continuously for more than six months are required to surrender any foreign exchange representing their earnings in respect of business conducted in Bangladesh or services rendered while in Bangladesh w i th in one month of the date of acquisition. Foreign exchange held abroad or in Bangla- desh by foreign diplomats and by foreign nationals em- ployed in embassies and missions of foreign countries in Bangladesh is, however, exempt from this requirement. The import of Bangladesh currency notes and coin exceeding Tk 100 is prohibited. Foreign currency trav- eler's checks and foreign currency notes may be brought in by nonresident travelers without limit, provided that the total amount brought in is declared to the customs authorities upon arrival. Foreign currency notes may be brought in w i thout limit by any person, provided that the total amount brought in is declared upon arrival. No declaration is required for import of foreign exchange not exceeding US$1,000 by nonresidents or US$750 by residents. Capital All outward transfers of capital require approval; such approval is not normally granted in respect of resident- owned capital. Inward capital transfers also require ap- proval. Movable and immovable assets, including foreign exchange, owned in any country other than Bangladesh have to be declared to the Bangladesh Bank by resident Bangladeshi nationals. There is no restriction on the importation of securities into Bangladesh, but the transfer of securities in favor of a person resident outside Ban- gladesh requires approval. This requirement applies to all Bangladesh securities, whether held,by residents or not, and to all foreign securities held by residents. Authorized dealers may obtain short-term loans and overdrafts from overseas branches and correspondents for a period not exceeding seven days at a time. Borrowing abroad by resident nonbank firms of Bangladesh origin requires approval. Borrowing by non-resident-owned or non-resident-controlled enterprises from commercial banks 93 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BANGLADESH in Bangladesh beyond specified ceilings, as well as any borrowing from abroad, requires approval, and loans by authorized dealers in local currency against overseas guarantees or collateral outside Bangladesh also require approval. Authorized dealers may, however, approve loans, overdrafts, or credit facilities against goods in- tended for export from Bangladesh to companies con- trolled by persons resident outside Bangladesh. Author- ized dealers must obtain approval before making any loans in foreign currencies to residents or nonresidents, whether secured or unsecured. They are not normally permitted to hold short-term foreign assets other than small working balances. The permission of the Bangladesh Bank is required for nonresidents other than banks to establish or continue a business in Bangladesh. Foreign private investment is governed by the Foreign Private Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act of 1980 and is permitted in collabo- ration with both the Government and private entrepre- neurs. The Act provides, inter alia, for protection and equitable treatment of foreign private investment, indem- nification, protection against expropriation and national- ization, and guarantee for repatriation of investment. In the private sector, however, foreign participation is lim- ited to those industries where technical know-how is not locally available, where the technology involved is very complicated, or where capital outlay is high, and to industries that are either based on local raw materials or that are wholly export oriented. For a new investment, foreign investors generally are required to provide as equity capital the entire amount of the project's foreign exchange component. There is no ceiling on private investment, but any investments above Tk 100 million need special approval. Tax holidays are granted for periods of up to nine years, depending on location. All foreign investments require approval by the Investment Board. Dividends on foreign capital may be remitted freely after payment of taxes, except that 10 percent of the annual remittable profits must be held in Bangladesh by sterling tea companies until the total amount held is equal to 200 percent of paid-up capital. Gold The import and export of silver in any form are prohibited without special permission, which is not nor- mally granted. Exports of gold jewelry are allowed only in jewelry form under the Jewelry Export Scheme. There are no restrictions on the internal sale, purchase, or possession of gold or silver ornaments (including coin) and jewelry, but there is a prohibition on the holding of gold and silver in all other forms except by licensed industrialists or dentists. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement The official exchange rate for the taka was adjusted on three occasions during the year, from Tk 30.80 = US$1 at the end of 1986 to Tk 31.20 = US$1 at the end of 1987. 94 January 5. The rate of XPB entitlement for wet-blue leather was fixed at 40 percent during the period up to end-June 1987. January 31. The rate of XPB entitlement for pencils, wooden slates, and staple pins was fixed at 40 percent, for ready-made garments made with imported fabrics at 70 percent during the period up to end-June 1987, and for leeches at 100 percent. May 19. The maximum amount of foreign exchange that residents can obtain in currency notes out of the normal annual travel quota/exporter's travel quota was increased from US$50 to US$300. July 1. The XPB entitlement was withdrawn for wet- blue leather. Suppliers of wet-blue leather to exporters of finished leather were considered as indirect exporters and became eligible for an XPB entitlement of 40 percent. Loose tea was made eligible to receive an XPB entitlement of 40 percent. December 15. The rate of XPB entitlement for electronic goods with 25 percent to 49 percent domestic value added was fixed at 70 percent, and for electronic goods with higher value added, at 100 percent. For ferrous products with 25 percent to 49 percent value added, the rate of XPB entitlement was fixed at 70 percent, and for these products with higher value added, at 100 percent. Prescription of Currency March 9. The Governments of Bangladesh and the U.S.S.R. signed a barter protocol dated January 18, 1987, to be valid until the end of December 1987. Bangladesh will export mainly ju te goods and tea and will import mainly machinery and equipment. April 30. The Governments of Bangladesh and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea signed a barter protocol for a period of one year beginning early February 1987, for an amount of US$12.5 million on a self-balancing basis. Bangladesh will mainly export ju te goods and tea and import cement, sugar, and coal. May 3. The TCB and Comtrade Limited (Switzerland) signed a special trading arrangement to be valid for a period of one year, in the amount of US$24 million on a self-balancing basis. June 13. The TCB and E. Merck (Federal Republic of Germany) signed a special trading arrangement to be valid for a period of one year, for an amount of US$2 million on a self-balancing basis. October 26. The TCB and Mitsubishi Corporation, London (Head Office, Tokyo) signed a special trading arrangement to be valid for a period of one year, in an amount of US$10 million on a self-balancing basis. December 3. The Governments of Bangladesh and the U.S.S.R. signed a barter protocol for an amount of Tk 2 billion, of which Tk 1.2 billion will cover merchandise trade and the remainder will be used for loan amortization.

Not for Redistribution with the principal amount. When due, interest on this account will be payable in local currency after deduction of usual government taxes/levies. Imports and Import Payments February 10. Industrial firms were allowed to open letters of credit on a deferred payments basis up to 180 days for imports of industrial raw materials under the SEM Scheme. July 14. The 1987/88 IPO came into effect. The new IPO shortened the Negative List items from 359 to 355 categories and the Restricted List items from 289 to 261 categories. Eleven essential inputs for industries were removed from the Restricted List categories. The IPO also eased entitlement limits on individual firms. The global limits on industrial firms' imports of restricted goods as well as the subceilings on raw materials, spare parts, and packing accessories were doubled. Commercial BANGLADESH importers were allowed to import industrial raw and packing materials and spare parts outside the Negative and the Restricted Lists at the SEM rate. Doctors, scientists, and engineers were allowed to import profes- sional equipment valued up to US$20,000 out of their own foreign exchange earnings abroad if they had lived at least three years abroad. August 27. The rate of margin deposit requirement in foreign currency in respect of letters of credit opened for imports of industrial raw materials by industrial firms was changed from 100 percent to a minimum of 50 percent. Capital March 28. The coverage under the Exchange Rate Fluctuation Burden Absorption Scheme will also be given to foreign currency loans channeled through nationalized commercial banks on the basis of relending by the Government; previously, only the loans channeled through the Development Finance Institutions were covered. 95 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BARBADOS (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Barbados is the Barbados Dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at BDS$2 = US$1. On December 31, 1987 the official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were BDS$1.9975 and BDS$2.0350, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for the Canadian dollar, the deutsche mark, and the pound sterling are also officially quoted. These rates include commission charges of 0.1875 percent, buying and 1.8125 percent, selling. On Decem- ber 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates of the Central Bank of Barbados for the Canadian dollar were BDS$1.5319 and BDS$ 1.5627, respectively, per Can$ l; those for the deutsche mark were BDS$1.2525 and BDS$1.2777, re- spectively, per DM 1; and those for the pound sterling were BDS$3.7100 and BDS$3.7844, respectively, per £ s t g. 1. Under clearing arrangements with regional monetary authorities, the Central Bank sells currencies of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) countries1 at fixed rates (including a commission of 0.125 percent) but purchases only East Caribbean dollar notes. The rate applied mutually for the purchase of currency notes is the parity rate between each pair of currencies determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar rate. The Central Bank regulates the commission that may be charged by the commercial banks in dealings with their customers in CARICOM currencies. Purchases of foreign exchange for private sector remittances abroad (except for remittances for payment of imports, travel allowances, education, and nontrade payments up to BDS$500 and certain other specified items) are subject to a levy collected in the approval process by the Central Bank at the rate of 1 percent of the value of the transaction. The Central Bank periodically obtains forward cover in the international foreign exchange market to cover or hedge its own or the Central Government's exchange risks associated with foreign exchange loans that are not denominated in U.S. dollars. Commercial banks are allowed to obtain forward cover in the international markets. Swap transactions in U.S. dollars are entered into between the Central Bank and commercial banks, while commercial banks may freely switch between nonre- gional currencies. Administration of Control Exchange control applies to all countries and is admin- istered by the Central Bank. The Central Bank delegates to authorized dealers the authority to approve normal import payments and the allocation of foreign exchange for certain other current payments and for cash gifts. The 1 The CARICOM countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nev is, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 96 exchange control system provides that foreign exchange should normally be surrendered to an authorized dealer. The normal exchange control directives do not apply to transactions between residents and persons resident in South Africa. Trade controls are administered by the Ministry of Trade, Indus try, and Commerce. Prescription of Currency Settlements with residents of countries outside the CARICOM area other than South Africa may be made in any foreign currency,2 or through an External Account in Barbados dollars. Settlements with residents of CARI- COM countries must be made either through External Accounts (in Barbados dollars) or in the currency of the CARICOM country concerned, except that commercial banks may issue CARICOM traveler's checks denominated in Trinidad and Tobago dollars to Barbadian residents traveling to other CARICOM countries, within the approved limits for travel allowances. Nonresident Accounts With the permission of the Central Bank, authorized dealers may maintain in foreign currencies Foreign Cur- rency Accounts in the names of residents of Barbados and of other countries. Approval for opening these ac- counts is given on the basis of the anticipated frequency of receipts and payments in foreign currency. Certain receipts and payments may be credited and debited to Foreign Currency Accounts under the conditions of ap- proval established at the time the account was opened. Other credits and debits require individual approval. External Accounts may be opened for nonresidents by authorized dealers without reference to the Central Bank. These accounts are maintained in Barbados dollars. They may be credited with proceeds from the sale of foreign currencies, with transfers from other External Accounts, with bank interest (payable on External Accounts or Blocked Accounts), and with payments by residents for which general or specific permission has been given by the Central Bank. They may be debited for payments to residents of Barbados, for the cost of foreign exchange required for travel or business purposes, and for any other payments covered by delegated authority to au- thorized dealers. Other debits and any overdrafts require individual approval. The Exchange Control Act of 1967 (as amended) em- powers the Central Bank to require certain payments in favor of nonresidents that are ineligible for transfer to be credited to Blocked Accounts. Balances in Blocked Ac- counts may not be withdrawn without approval, other than for the purchase of approved securities. 2 Foreign currencies comprise all currencies other than the Barbados dollar. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited, and certain imports originating in non-CARicoM countries require individual licenses. Import licensing requ iremen ts and quantitative restrictions are the chief tools of Bar- badian external commercial policy. The list of products subject to licensing is extensive. However, not all goods that are subject to import licensing are subject to quan- titative restriction. Some items on the import licensing list may be freely imported throughout the year, while some others are subject to temporary restriction (partic- ularly agricultural products, which tend to be subject to seasonal restriction). Certain imports are prohibited; these include various foods tuffs, blue jeans, and beer not produced w i th in the CARICOM area. There is also a 4'Nega t ive List" for certain garments, the importation of which is totally prohibited if the product is below a m in imum c.i.f. value. Ind iv idual licenses are also required for imports of commodities that are subject to the pro- visions of the Oils and Fats Agreement between the Governments of Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago, whether the goods are being imported from CARICOM countries or from elsewhere. Special licensing arrangements have been made for the regulation of trade between Barbados and other CARICOM countries in 22 agricultural commodities. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon application and submission of documentary evidence (invoices and customs warrants) to authorized dealers; payments for imports of crude oil and derivatives are subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank. Advance payments for imports require prior approval by the Central Bank. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require exchange control ap- proval. Except for transactions involving residents of South Africa, payments for all commercial transactions are permitted freely when the application is supported by appropriate documentary evidence. Authority has been delegated to authorized dealers to provide basic allocations of foreign exchange for certain payments of a personal nature and for sundry paymen ts. These include foreign travel (for which up to BDS$ 1,500 a person a calendar year may be allocated for private travel w i th in or outside the CARICOM area; and BDS$200 a day, up to BDS$4,000 a person a calendar year, for business travel w i th in the CARICOM area, and BDS$6,000 outside the CARICOM area), expenses of education abroad (BDS$5,000 a person a year), remittances of cash gifts not exceeding BDS$100 a donor a year, subscriptions to newspapers and magazines, income tax re funds, official paymen ts, and life insurance premiums. Applications for additional amounts or for purposes for which there is no basic allocation are approved by the authorities, provided that no unauthorized transfer of capital appears to be involved. The cost of transportation to any destination BARBADOS may be settled in domestic currency and is not deducted from the travel allocation. Outward remittances of funds to overseas insurers or other pension fund administrators are subject to a tax of 6 percent. Residents traveling to any destination outside Barbados may take out foreign currency notes and coin up to the value of BDS$500 and Barbados notes up to BDS$200. Nonresident visitors are not permitted to take out any Barbados currency but may freely export any foreign currency they had previously brought in. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited. Specific licenses are required for the export of certain goods to any coun try; these include rice, cane sugar, rum, molasses, and certain other food products, sewing machines, portland cement, and petroleum products. All other goods may be exported w i thout license. The collection of export proceeds is supervised by the Central Bank to ensure that proceeds in foreign currencies are surrendered w i th in six mon ths from the date of sh ipmen t. Exports of sugar to the United Kingdom and the United States are subject to bilateral export quotas, as are exports of rum to the European Economic Community. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign currency proceeds from invisibles must be sold to authorized dealers. Travelers to Barbados may bring in freely notes and coins denominated in Barbados dollars or in any foreign currency. Residents are required to sell their holdings of foreign currencies to an authorized dealer upon re turn to Barbados. Capital All outward capital transfers, including direct invest- men ts by residents and the purchase by residents of foreign currency securities and of real estate situated abroad, require exchange control approval. Certificates of title to foreign currency securities held by residents must be lodged with an authorized depository in Barbados, and earnings on these securities must be repatriated and surrendered to an authorized dealer. Personal capital transfers, such as inheritances due to nonresidents, require exchange control approval. Trans- fers in respect of inheritances are restricted to BDS$20,000 annually for each nonresident beneficiary. Dowries in the form of settlements and cash gifts may be transferred to nonresidents with exchange control approval, normally up to BDS$500 a donor a year. Emigrating Barbadian nationals are granted settling-in allowances from their declared assets at the rate of BDS$20,000 a family unit a year. The Central Bank also considers applications from foreign nationals who have resided in Barbados and are proceeding to take up permanent residence abroad, provided that they declare their assets held in Barbados. Direct investment by nonresidents may be made with exchange control approval. The remittance of earnings 97 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BARBADOS on, and liquidation proceeds from, such investment is permitted, subject to the submission of documentary evidence as to the validity of the remittance, the discharge of any liabilities related to the investment, and the registration of the original investment with the Central Bank. The issuance and transfer to nonresidents of securities registered in Barbados require exchange control approval, which is freely given on condition that an adequate amount of foreign currency is brought in for their purchase. Proceeds from the realization of these securities may be remitted when it is established that the original investment was financed from foreign currency sources. Nonresidents may acquire real estate in Barbados for private pur- poses with funds from foreign currency sources; local currency financing is not ordinarily permitted. Proceeds from the realization of such investments equivalent to the amount of foreign currency brought in may be repatri- ated freely. Capital sums realized in excess of this amount may be repatriated freely on the basis of a calculated rate of return on the original foreign investment, as follows: for the last five years at 8 percent a year; for the five years immediately preceding the last five years at 5 percent; and for any period preceding the last ten years at 4 percent. Amounts in excess of the sum so derived are restricted to the remittance of BDS$24,000 a year. The approval of the Central Bank is required for residents to borrow abroad or for nonresidents to borrow in Barbados. Authorized dealers may assume short-term liability positions in foreign currencies for the financing of approved transfers in respect of both trade and nontrade transactions. They may also freely accept deposits from nonresidents. Any borrowing abroad by authorized deal- ers to finance their domestic operations requires the approval of the Central Bank. Gold Gold coins with face values of BDS$100, BDS$150, BDS$200, and BDS$500 are legal tender and are in limited circulation. Residents who are private persons are per- mitted to acquire and hold gold coins for numismatic purposes only. Otherwise, any gold acquired in Barbados must be surrendered to an authorized dealer, unless exchange control approval is obtained for its retention. Residents other than the monetary authorities, authorized dealers, and industrial users are not permitted to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry or coins for numismatic purposes. Imports of gold by residents are permitted for industrial purposes and are subject to customs duties and charges. Licenses to import gold are issued by the Ministry of Trade and Commerce; no license is required to export gold, but exchange control permis- sion is required to do so. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments October 15. Household aerosol insecticides were added to the list of items requiring import licenses. November 30. Fixed vegetable oils, fluid or solid, crude, refined or purified-excluding rape, colza and mustard oil, linseed oil, castor oil, and tung oil—were added to the list of items requiring import licenses. December 10. The following products were added to the list of items requiring import licenses: shovels; rakes; wheelbarrows; whole-slip coordinate sets and half-slip coordinate sets, kn i t ted, for women and girls; suits and costumes for women, girls, and infants; suits (complete) for men and boys; bathing apparel; bathing trunks and swim suits for men and boys; bathing apparel for women, girls, and infants; corsets and girdles (complete) including girdle coordinate sets; and brassiere coordinate sets. 98 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Belgium is the Belgian Franc, and the currency of Luxembourg is the Luxembourg Franc. Luxembourg is linked to Belgium in a monetary associ- ation w i th in which the Luxembourg franc is at par with the Belgian franc. Belgium and Luxembourg participate with Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Italy, and the Netherlands in the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, Bel- gium and Luxembourg maintain the spot exchange rates between their currencies and the currencies of the other participants w i th in margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the bilateral central rates. The agreement implies that the National Bank of Belgium stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. On December 31, 1987 these rates were as follows: Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Danish kroner 100 deutsche mark 100 French francs 1 Irish pound 100 Italian lire 100 Netherlands guilders Belgian Francs or Luxembourg Francs Upper limit Lower limit 553.0000 528.7000 2,109.5000 2,016.5500 628.9700 601.2950 56.5115 54.0250 3.0387 2.6953 1,872.1500 1,789.8500 The participants in the EMS do not maintain the exchange rates for other currencies w i th in fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper func t ion ing of the system, they intervene in concert to smooth out fluctua- tions in exchange rates, the intervention currencies being each other's and the U.S. dollar. In Belgium-Luxembourg there are two spot exchange markets, the official (or regulated) market and the free market. Most current transactions are settled in the official market; and only authorized banks may carry out ex- change transactions permitted in that market. Most capital transactions take place in the free market. In a few cases, however, there is freedom of choice as to the exchange market in which conversion is to be effected. Authorized banks may sell on the official market currencies acquired on the free market. Most convertible currencies are dealt in the official market.1 There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. 1 Currencies dealt in the official market are Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Neth- erlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, South African rand, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, and Zaire zaires. The ECU (European Currency Un i t) is treated Nonbank residents may not acquire convertible cur- rencies in the official spot market until a foreign payment is due. Nonbank residents may make forward purchases and sales of convertible currencies in the official market through authorized banks, provided that any foreign currency purchased is used for the authorized settlement of obligations within 15 working days from delivery (on the delivery date itself if the maturity of the forward contract is less than 15 days); exchange not used within that period must be resold in the official market. Profits resulting from forward contracts not used to cover au- thorized inward or outward payments through the official market must be surrendered to the Treasury. On Decem- ber 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in the official market were BF 33.0425 and BF 33.2625, respectively, per US$1. In the free exchange market, all currencies (including domestic and foreign bank notes) may be bought and sold at freely fluctuating rates. On December 31, 1987 the free market rates between banks for the U.S. dollar were BF 33.23 buying and BF 33.28 selling, per US$1. Any resident or nonresident, including banks, may deal in the free market. Forward transactions, whether by banks or nonbanks, are uncontrolled and do not require a permitted underlying transaction. There is normally no intervention in forward exchange in either exchange market. Belgium and Luxembourg formally accepted the obli- gations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Exchange Control Territory There is no exchange control between Belgium and Luxembourg; the two countries constitute a single ex- change control territory in relation to other countries. Banks in Luxembourg may not accept deposits in Lux- embourg francs from nonresidents in Luxembourg or term deposits in excess of Lux F 1 million for 12 months or less from residents in Luxembourg. Administration of Control The ultimate responsibility for the administration of exchange control in the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) is exercised by the Belgian-Luxembourg Exchange Institute (BLEI). Exchange control powers for most payments and transfers are delegated to authorized banks. The Belgian-Luxembourg Administrative Com- mission has authority to license trade transactions; it determines import and export policy, but has delegated the issuance of import and export licenses to the licensing offices of the BLEU, one of which is located in each on an equal footing with the other currencies traded in the official market. The Australian dollar and the South African rand are not officially quoted. Since February 1, 1988, the Greek drachma has been traded in the official market. 99 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG country. Bank supervision in Belgium is exercised by the Bank Commission, and in Luxembourg, by the Luxem- bourg Monetary Institute. Prescription of Currency The prescription of currency requirements operate mainly to ensure that settlements with foreign countries are made through the appropriate exchange market or, where payments in Belgian or Luxembourg francs are involved, through the appropriate category of nonresident account. All inward and outward transactions are classified into four groups, which may be summarized as follows. List A covers merchandise, transport expenses, industrial expenses (e.g., costs of processing), and other commercial expenses, including insurance, administrative expenses of sales agencies and credit card companies, and sharing in administrative expenses of central offices by branches and affiliates. List B covers settlements of travel agencies, salaries, pensions, fees, subscriptions, taxes, and public administration paymen ts. It also includes family support payments by immigrant workers of foreign nationality. List C covers (1) income on securities, loans, etc., rents, and operating profits; and (2) repatriation of certain foreign long-term inves tmen ts and transfers by emigrants of foreign nationality. List D covers gifts, life insurance paymen ts, family maintenance paymen ts, capital invest- men ts, liquidation of long-term inves tmen ts, dealings in gold, transfers by emigrants of Belgian or Luxembourg nationality, transfers by immigrants, inheritances, for- ward covering of merchandise, private travel expenses (except when settled through travel agencies), and all transactions not in any of the other three lists. The permissible methods of settlement for foreign paymen ts are as summarized in the table below.

These cover essen- tially direct inves tment by enterprises and some capital transfers by ind iv idua ls. Conversely, imports and exports of diamonds, including related costs, may only be paid for in foreign currencies through the free marke t, or in Belgian or Luxembourg francs by means of nonresident Financial Accounts, or in domestic or foreign bank notes. Payments for goods of Egyptian origin (other than rice, raw cotton, and crude petroleum) are subject to special rules. Nonresident Accounts Belgian or Luxembourg franc accounts of nonresidents are classified as follows: 1. Convertible Accounts. Balances on these accounts are equivalent to currencies negotiated on the official marke t, and accounts may be opened freely in the name 100 of any nonresident.2 They are not related to any country or monetary area. They may be used free ly for settlements w i th res iden ts that either must or may be made through the official market and for retransfer abroad through the official marke t, and they may be credited freely with proceeds from the sale by a nonres ident of convertible currencies in the official market to authorized banks in Belgium and Luxembourg. Balances on Convertible Ac- counts may be transferred freely to other Convertible Accounts or to Financial Accounts or be converted into any cu r rency in the official or the free marke t. Advances on Convertible Accoun ts other than mail-credit advances are subject to authorization by the BLEI.

Not for Redistribution debtor interest rate may be prescribed during certain periods for mail-credit advances in Convertible Accounts of banks, with the exception of those for developing countries. Convertible Accounts may be held in the form of sight accounts (demand deposits), prior notice ac- counts, and time deposits. 2. Financial Accounts. These accounts may be opened for all nonresidents.3 They may be used freely for settle- ments that either must or may be made through the free market and for re transfer abroad through the free market, and they may be credited with proceeds from the sale by a nonresident of gold or any currency in the free or the official market. Domestic bank notes and proceeds from the sale in the free market of foreign bank notes, when deposited with authorized banks by foreign travelers in Belgium and Luxembourg or by persons residing abroad, may be credited to Financial Accounts. Transfers between Financial Accounts are free. Balances on these accounts may be used to purchase gold or any currency negotiated in the free market. Interest, charges, and commissions relating to any nonresident account must be credited or debited either to the account in question or to another of the same category. Imports and Import Payments Individual licenses are required for (1) all imports from Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czecho- slovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam;4 and (2) a number of imports from all other countries outside the BLEU .5 The commodities for which individual licenses are required include many textile and steel products, certain agricultural products and food- stuffs, coal and petroleum products, diamonds, semipro- cessed gold, and weapons. All other commodities are free of license. Many commodities subject to individual licensing are also admitted without quantitative restric- tion. Along with other European Communities (EC) countries, the BLEU applies quotas on a number of textile products from non-EC countries; the BLEU also applies a system of m in imum import prices to foreign steel products. Imports from non-EC countries of most products cov- ered by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EC are subject to import levies, which have replaced all previous barriers to imports; common EC regulations are also applied to imports from non-EC countries of most other agricultural and livestock products. 3 Foreign diplomats, foreign nationals employed by diplomatic repre- sentations accredited in the BLEU and by specified international orga- nizations situated in the BLEU, individuals residing in Bu rund i, Rwanda, or Zaire, and BLEU nationals residing abroad temporarily for professional reasons are authorized to maintain Assimilated Resident Accounts. 4 Import licenses are issued freely for a large number of commodities when originating in and shipped from these countries. 5 Most imports in the latter group do not require an import license when imported from the Netherlands or from other EC countries. BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG Import payments are subject to the same rules as those applicable to payments for invisibles (List A). No ex- change control documentation is required. Special au- thorization must be obtained for import payments that precede the date of customs clearance by more than three months. Payments for transit transactions must be sup- ported by a form (model T), which must be presented to an authorized bank; these payments cannot be made earlier than three months before the date on which the payment from the foreign buyer is expected to be received. Other transit payments are subject to the same rules as those applicable to payments for invisibles (List A). Prior examination of supporting documents by the BLEI is required for import and transit payments exceeding BF 25 million. Import and transit payments, which are fully or partially settled by means of bilateral netting, have to be reported to the BLEI. Authorization by the BLEI is required for participation in a multilateral netting system involving import and transit payments. Payments for Invisibles Payments for transactions included in Lists A and B must be made through the official exchange market or by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Convertible Account. An authorized bank is required to make certain that payment is made by one of the methods stipulated in the regulations (see section on Prescription of Currency, above) and that spot foreign exchange is not acquired until the payment is due. For payments exceeding BF 25 million and in other exceptional cases, prior examination of supporting documents by the BLEI is required. Pay- ments for items on List C can be made either through the official market (alternatively, by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Convertible Account) or through the free market (alternatively, by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Financial Account, or in foreign or domestic bank notes); payments for items on List D must be made through the free market (alternatively, by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Financial Account, or in foreign or domestic bank notes). Foreign and domestic bank notes may be exported freely. Exports and Export Proceeds Individual licenses are required for exports of specified commodities to all countries outside the BLEU, such as weapons, strategic products, and agricultural products. Individual licenses are also required for steel products exported to the United States.6 All other exports are free of license. Export proceeds must be collected in accordance with the same rules as those applicable to proceeds from invisibles (List A). Exchange control documentation is not required. Special authorization must be obtained to collect export proceeds more than six months after the date of exportation. 6 Most exports do not require an export license when exported to the Netherlands or to other EC countries. 101 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG Proceeds from transit transactions have to be docu- mented on a form (model T), which must be presented to an authorized bank. These proceeds must be collected within three months from the date of payment to the foreign supplier. Proceeds from other transit transactions have to be collected in accordance with the same rules as those applicable to proceeds from invisibles (List A). Export and transit receipts, which are fully or partially settled by means of bilateral netting, have to be reported to the BLEI. Authorization by the BLEI is required for participation in a multilateral netting system involving export and transit receipts. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts in convertible currencies from invisibles con- nected with commercial transactions (Lists A and B— see section on Prescription of Currency, above) must be surrendered (i.e., sold in the official exchange market) within eight days of receipt or, alternatively, be credited to a Regulated Resident Account in Foreign Currency with an authorized bank if they are to be used later for authorized current payments through the official market. A holder of a Regulated Account is required to use holdings in these accounts by priority whenever an authorized payment through the official exchange market is made. The BLEI may order the holder to sell part or all of the holdings in the official market, to abstain temporarily from making new deposits, and to surrender to the Treasury all gains from exchange rate appreciation. Receipts in foreign currencies from transactions included in Lists C and D may be retained or sold in the official or the free market. Proceeds from transactions included in Lists C and D may also be collected in domestic or foreign bank notes. Foreign and domestic bank notes may be imported freely. Capital All capital transactions may be carried out through the free market, by settlement in Belgian or Luxembourg francs through the Financial Account of a nonresident, or in domestic or foreign bank notes. Direct investments by companies and some capital transfers by individuals, inc lud ing gifts, family maintenance payments, remit- tances by emigrants of Belgian or Luxembourg nation- ality, and inheritances, may also be made through the official market, subject to individual license. The exchange control authorities may guarantee the repatriation of approved foreign investments made in Belgium and Lux- embourg. In that case, capital brought in through the official market (under special license and as an exception to the standard prescription of currency set out above) may be repatriated through that market. Also eligible for outward transfer through the official market are the amortization and redemption proceeds of bonds denominated in Belgian or Luxembourg francs, quoted on a stock exchange in the BLEU, and owned by nonresidents, provided that such securities have been held at least 18 months prior to the maturity date. All transactions in securities by residents or nonresidents are 102 free, but the financial settlement of such transactions must conform to the general regulations for capital trans- actions. The prior approval of the Ministry of Finance is required for issues of securities on the Belgian capital market by nonresidents; most of the Belgian franc bond issues on the domestic capital market have, in practice, been made by international organizations, while issues of Eurobonds denominated in Belgian francs are not nor- mally permitted. Public bids by foreign companies or individuals for the purchase or exchange of shares issued by Belgian companies require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance. The Luxembourg Monetary Institute (LMI) regulates the issue of franc-denominated bonds on the Luxembourg capital market: for public bond issues, an official calendar is established and priority is given to domestic public sector borrowing and to enterprises utilizing the funds for domestic investment; for private bond issues, no official calendar exists, but the LMI monitors the overall volume and frequency of issues. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in coins or bars, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in these forms by residents and nonresidents are unrestricted and free of license; settlements in respect of gold transactions in coins or bars may be made only through the free market, through Financial Accounts in Belgian or Luxembourg francs, or in domestic or foreign bank notes. Imports and transactions in monetary gold are subject to a value-added tax in Belgium at a rate of 1 percent. Licenses are required for imports of semipro- cessed gold. Imports of gold for industrial, artistic, or medical use may be paid through the official market. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 12. The intervention limits of the Belgium and Luxembourg francs within the EMS were redefined as follows: Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Danish kroner 100 deutsche mark 100 French francs 1 Irish pound 100 Italian lire 100 Netherlands guilders Belgian Francs or Luxembourg Francs Upper limit Lower limit 553.0000 528.7000 2,109.5000 2,016.5500 628.9700 601.2950 56.5115 54.0250 3.0387 2.6953 1,872.1500 1,789.8500 Nonresident Accounts January 1.

Not for Redistribution BELIZE (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Belize is the Belize Dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at a rate of BZ$1 = US$0.50. The buy ing and selling rates for transactions between the Central Bank and the com- mercial banks are BZ$1.9937 and BZ$2.0063 per US$1, respectively. On December 31,1987 the buy ing and selling rates in transactions between the banks and members of the public were BZ$1.9825 and BZ$2.0175 per US$1, respectively. The Central Bank quotes daily rates for the pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, and a number of currencies of member countries of the CARICOM. ' A stamp duty of 1.25 percent is levied on all conversions from the Belize dollar to foreign currency. Belize acccepted the obligations of Article V I I I, Sec- tions 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement on June 14, 1983. Administration of Control The Central Bank is responsible for the administration of exchange control, which is applicable to all countries. Authority covering a wide range of operations is delegated to the commercial banks in their capacity as authorized dealers. Only in exceptional cases or in applications involving substantial amounts is reference made directly to the Central Bank. However, all applications for foreign exchange processed by authorized dealers are regularly forwarded to the Central Bank for audit and record keeping. Trade controls are administered by the M in is try of Commerce and Indus try. Prescription of Currency The only prescription of currency requirement relates to a specified list of currencies2 in which authorized intermediaries are permitted to deal with the public. Payments to a CARICOM member country must be made in the currency of that country. Nonresident Accounts Permission of the Central Bank is needed for banks to open external or foreign currency accounts. The Central Bank may direct also that sums to be credited or paid to foreign residents be credited to a blocked account. Imports and Import Payments Payments for imports require authorization by the Central Bank; in most cases such authorization is dele- gated to the commercial banks. For reasons of health, standardization, and protection of domestic industries, import licenses from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry are required for a number of goods —mostly food and agricultural products, and certain household and construction products; such licenses are liberally admin- istered. There are no quota limits nor other quantitative restrictions for balance of paymen ts reasons. Most im- ports are subject to a stamp duty of 12 percent of the c.i.f. value; the rate of stamp du ty on citrus is 25 percent. Imports by most of the public sector and certain nonprofit entities, imports of an emergency or humanitarian nature, and goods for re-export are exempt from import duties; goods originating from the CARICOM area are also exempt. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on paymen ts for invisibles. Authorized dealers have the power to provide foreign exchange for such paymen ts w i th in certain limits. The following limits are applied to purchases of foreign ex- change: (1) nonbusiness travel by residents, up to BZ$1,500 a person a calendar year; (2) business travel by residents, BZ$200 a day a person, up to BZ$6,000 a year; (3) business or nonbusiness travel by nonresidents, BZ$500 a person a year, except where payment is made from an external account or from proceeds of foreign currency; (4) educational allowance, BZ$500 a course a year (apart from a once-only allowance of BZ$ 1,000 for educational expenses and maintenance); and (5) g if ts, BZ$100 a donor. Requests in excess of these amounts are referred to the Central Bank; all bona fide requests are granted. Exports of foreign and domestic bank notes and cur- rency are subject to limits as follows: each traveler may carry domestic bank notes up to BZ$100 and the equiv- alent of BZ$400 in foreign currency, except that a visitor may take out such notes up to the amount imported. Amoun ts beyond these limits require approval of the Central Bank, which is liberally granted when jus t i f ied. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required for most of the export products. Export proceeds must be surrendered to au- thorized dealers not later than six mon ths after the date of sh ipmen t, unless de term ined otherwise by the Central Bank. A small number of items3 are subject to an ad valorem export du ty of 5 percent. Re-exports and trans- shipments are subject to a 3 percent customs administra- tion fee. Proceeds from Invisibles 1 The CARICOM countries are Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. K i t ts and Nev is, St. Lucia, St. V incent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 2 Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, U.S. dollars, and the currencies of the member countries of the CAR ICOM. Foreign currency proceeds from invisibles must be sold to an authorized dealer. Travelers to Belize are free to 3 Lobster, shr imp, conch, fish, tu r t le s, mahogany, and w i ld an ima ls. For sugar, the export d u ty is 2 pe rcen t. 104 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution bring in notes and coins denominated in Belize dollars up to BZ$100 a person, but there are no restrictions on imports of foreign currency. Resident travelers are re- quired to sell their excess holdings of foreign currencies to an authorized dealer upon return to Belize. Capital All capital transfers require approval of the Central Bank but control is liberally administered. Gold Residents may not hold gold except by specific au- thorization from the Central Bank. Gold may neither be imported nor exported without the approval of the Central Bank. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. BELIZE 105 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BENIN (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Benin is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. They include a bank commission. The BCEAO levies a com- mission of 0.10 per mill for transfers from countries outside the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) and 2.50 per mill for transfers to countries outside the WAMU .2 Banks levy a commission on transfers to all countries outside the WAMU, part of which must be surrendered to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Forward exchange contracts may be arranged, with the prior authorization of the Minister of Finance, for payments for specified imports. The maturity period cannot be extended. With the exception of those relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, Benin's exchange control measures do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote dTvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries bu t, for purposes of certain controls relating to capital flows, the countries specified in this paragraph are also regarded as foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of Currency and Credit in the Ministry of Finance and Economy, in conjunction with the Directorate of External Commerce in the Ministry of Commerce, Handicrafts, and Tourism. The Ministry of Finance and Economy, however, has the main responsibility for drawing up the exchange control regulations, in collaboration with the BCEAO. The BCEAO is authorized to collect, either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries pub l ic, any information necessary to compile balance of paymen ts statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be carried out by authorized intermediaries. Import li- censes are issued by the Directorate of External Com- 1 The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1' Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Ben in, Bu rk ina Faso, Cote d ' lvo i re, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2 Transfers between member countries of the Un ion are subject to a flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on se t t lemen ts between agencies of the BCEAO. 106 merce. Exports of diamonds and other precious or semi- precious materials require prior approval in the form of a decree issued by the National Executive Council (Coun- cil of Ministers). Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Since Benin is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Accoun t, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and other countries linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Current payments to or from The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are nor- mally made through the West African Clearing House. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Certain settlements with the People's Republic of China and specified socialist coun- tries, however, are made through special accounts.3 All settlements with South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may hold Foreign Accounts in Francs with authorized intermediary banks. The crediting to nonresident accounts of CFA bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other ins t i tu te of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is not perm i t ted, except for BCEAO bank notes mailed direct to the BCEAO agency in Cotonou by an authorized intermediary bank 's foreign correspondent for credit to a Foreign Account in Francs opened by the latter w i th an authorized bank. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, without prior authorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes mailed by authorized intermediaries direct to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments All imports originating in or proceeding from South Africa are p roh ib i ted /Ce r ta in imports, such as narcotics, are prohibited from all sources. Certain agencies have an import monopoly for specified commodities. Imports of goods from any coun try, whe ther made with or without transfer of exchange, are subject to prior authorization from the Directorate of External Commerce. Goods may be imported into Benin according to one of the following three regimes: (1) goods which may be imported under a global import authorization issued to an enterprise; (2) unrestricted goods which may be freely imported w i th the authorization of the Directorate of External Commerce; or (3) goods subject to quota. 3 There is an inoperative paymen ts agreement w i th Hunga ry. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution All imports originating in foreign countries, when valued at more than CFAF 500,000, must be domiciled with an authorized intermediary bank. The import licenses or import certificates entitle importers to purchase the nec- essary exchange, but not earlier than eight days before shipment if a documentary credit is opened, or on the due date of payment if the commodities have already been imported. Import licenses are subject to a tax equivalent to 0.85 percent of the c.i.f. value of corre- sponding imports. Payments for Invisibles Payments to South Africa are prohibited. Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to the approval of the Directorate of External Commerce, but for many types of invisibles the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Authorized banks and the Postal Administration have been empowered to make payments abroad freely on behalf of residents, up to CFAF 50,000 a transfer. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also subject to prior authorization. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the countries linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a trip for each person (CFAF 87,500 for children under 10 years) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 5,000 remaining after return to Benin must be surrendered. For business travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 400,000 a trip. However, with the special authorization of the Minister of Finance, larger allocations may be obtained up to the equivalent of CFAF 250,000 per person per trip for tourist travel and up to the equivalent of CFAF 1,500,000 for business travel. The transfer of one half of the net salary of a foreigner working in Benin is permitted, subject to authorization by the Directorate of Money and Credit upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Residents traveling to countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes, but if proceeding to a country that is not a member of the WAMU, they must declare to customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers may take out any unutilized foreign bank notes and coin up to the amount declared by them on entry, subject to adjustment for amounts exchanged for CFA francs or obtained by exchange of foreign currency. Nonresident travelers may take out BENIN freely the equivalent of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by the countries linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account; a maximum amount equivalent to CFAF 25,000 in foreign bank notes; and any amount in other foreign means of payment (traveler's checks, etc.) established abroad and in their name. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports to all foreign countries, including the French Franc Area, must be domiciled with an authorized intermediary bank when valued at more than CFAF 500,000. All exports, except gold and diamonds, are free of license but require an export application issued by the Directorate of External Commerce. The due date of payment for exports may not be later than 180 days after the arrival of the com- modities at their destination; the foreign exchange thus received must be sold to an authorized bank within 30 days of payment due date, and its proceeds must be repatriated to Benin by the latter by transfer via the BCEAO. Irrespective of currency of payment, prior authorization is required for the retention, sale, import, or export of raw diamonds and of precious and semipre- cious materials. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries maintaining Operations Accounts with the French Treasury may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other coun- tries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue main- taining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area; residents bringing in foreign bank notes and foreign currency traveler's checks in excess of CFAF 5,000 must declare them to customs upon entry and sell them to an authorized intermediary bank within eight days. Capital Transfers of capital between Benin and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between Benin and France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account are free of exchange control; most capital transfers to all other countries require prior approval by the Ministry of Finance and Economy and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward foreign direct investment and all outward investment in foreign countries, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign 107 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BENIN securities in Benin. Such operations require prior au- thorization by the Minister of Finance and Economy. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Beninese Government, and (2) shares that are similar to or may be substituted for securities whose issuance or sale in Benin has already been authorized. With the exception of controls over foreign securities, these mea- sures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, member countries of the WAMU, and the countries linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account. Special controls are maintained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit or investment with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate and building operations abroad; these special controls also apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries main- taining Operations Accounts. All investments abroad by residents of Benin require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Econ- omy; at least 75 percent of such investments must be financed from foreign borrowing.4 Foreign direct invest- ments in Benin5 must be declared to the Minister before they are made. The Minister may request the postpone- ment of the operations within a period of two months. The full or partial liquidation of either type of investment also requires declaration. Both the making and the liq- uidation of investments, whether these are Beninese investments abroad or foreign investments in Benin, must be reported to the Minister and to the BCEAO within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Econ- omy. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) loans taken up by industrial firms to finance operations abroad, by international merchanting and export-import firms (approved by the Minister of Finance and Economy) to finance transit trade, or by any type of firm to finance imports and exports; (3) loans contracted by authorized banks; and (4) subject to certain conditions, loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans, including the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower. The repayment of loans not constituting a direct invest- ment requires the special authorization of the Minister of 4 Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Benin and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Benin. 5 Including those made by companies in Benin that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Benin of foreign companies. 108 Finance and Economy if the loan itself was subject to such approval, but is exempt if the loan was exempt from special authorization. Lending abroad is subject to prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Economy. The Investment Code (Law No. 82-005 of May 20, 1982) provides for preferential status that may be granted to foreign and domestic investments in indus try, mining, fisheries, agriculture, and tourism, when such investments are deemed to be of value to national development. Four preferential regimes are established. Plan A is intended for public and mixed enterprises operating at the national and provincial levels and provides, during a period of up to five years, for exemption from import duties and taxes on materials necessary for the production of the proposed item and from certain other taxation. Plan B is intended for domestic and foreign private enterprises contributing to the economic and social development of Benin, and provides, in addition to the benefits of Plan A, certain tax privileges for a maximum exemption period of five years. Plan C is intended for very large enterprises wishing to conclude incorporation agreements with Benin, and is granted for a period of up to ten years. In addition to the benefits of Plan B, Plan C guarantees stability of tax status, free choice of suppliers, and certain advantages. For Plans A, B, and C, up to two years for installation time may be added to the period of the agreement. Plan D provides certain benefits for small and medium-sized domestic enterprises and cooperatives for up to five years. The method of application of the Inves tment Code is set out in Decree No. 28-254 of July 13, 1983. Gold Prior authorization in the form of a decree issued by the National Economic Council (Council of Ministers), acting on the advice of the Minister in Charge of Mines, is required to hold, sell, import, export, or deal in raw diamonds and precious or semiprecious materials. In practice, residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Benin. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Commerce, Handicrafts, and Tourism, which is seldom granted. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold- filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold articles up to a maximum weight to be determined by an Order of the Minister. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments February 29. The specific duties on paints and varnish were replaced by an ad valorem duty of 20 percent.

Not for Redistribution BHUTAN (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Bhutan is the Ngultrum. Since its introduction in 1974, it has been pegged to the Indian rupee, which also circulates in Bhutan, at a rate of Nu 1 = Rs 1. The rates for currencies other than the Indian rupee are determined daily on the basis of the prevailing quotations by the Reserve Bank of India for those cur- rencies. If no large transactions are involved, exchange rates for other currencies may be determined on the basis of the most recent quotations by the Reserve Bank of India. No other exchange rates apply to international transactions, and there are no subsidies or taxes on exchange transactions. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates of the ngultrum for the U.S. dollar were Nu 12.55 and Nu 13.05 per US$1, respectively. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk operating in the official or the commercial banking sector. Administration of Control The Ministry of Finance controls external transactions and provides foreign exchange for most current and capital transactions. Beginning from July 26, 1985, substantial powers are delegated by the Ministry of Finance to the Royal Monetary Authority to release foreign exchange (other than Indian rupees) for current transactions. The Royal Monetary Authority is in charge of implementation of the surrender requirements for proceeds from mer- chandise exports. Prescription of Currency There are no regulations prescribing use of specific currencies in external receipts and payments. Imports and Import Payments All import payments other than those made in Indian rupees are subject to prior permission from the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry has discretionary authority to deny foreign exchange for the payment of luxury imports. Customs duties exist on imports other than those from India. Exports and Export Proceeds There are no export taxes. Exports to countries other than India receive a subsidy at the rate of up to 30 percent of the f.o.b. value. Exports of antiques of Bhutanese origin are prohibited. Proceeds of exports in currencies other than the Indian rupee must be surrendered to the Royal Monetary Authority either directly or through the Bank of Bhutan. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Most invisible payments other than those made in Indian rupees are subject to approval by the Royal Monetary Authority. All receipts from invisible transac- tions in currencies other than the Indian rupee must be surrendered to the Royal Monetary Authority.

Not for Redistribution BOLIVIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Bolivia is the Boliviano (Bs). The official buy ing rate is determined at an auction held daily by the Central Bank of Bolivia. On December 31, 1987 the official buy ing rate was Bs 2.21 = US$1. The official exchange rate applies to all foreign exchange operations in Bolivia. The auctions are conducted by the Committee for Exchange and Reserves (Comite de Cambio y Reser- vas) in the Central Bank. Prior to each auction, the Committee decides on the amount of foreign exchange to be auctioned and a floor price below which the Central Bank will not accept any bids. The Central Bank is required to offer in all auctions unitary lots of US$5,000 or multiples of this amount. The m in imum allowable bid is US$5,000 or multiples of this amount. Successful bidders are charged the exchange rate specified in their bid. In general, the spreads between the maximum and m in imum bids have been less than 2 percent. The sale of foreign exchange to the public is free of all taxes and commissions. Except for the requirement to surrender the net proceeds from the export of goods and services, all banks, exchange houses, companies, and individuals can buy and sell foreign exchange freely. Successful bids channeled through the banking system are voided if the banking institution submitting the bid is not complying with the legal reserve requirement on deposits at the time of the auction. However, banks must maintain a balanced spot position in foreign exchange at all times and sell to the Central Bank any excess balance at the end of each day. All public sector ins t i tu t ions, including the public enterprises, must purchase foreign exchange for imports of goods and services through the Central Bank auction market. There is a parallel but tolerated exchange marke t, in which the exchange rate on December 31, 1987 was Bs 2.22 = US$1 (buying) and Bs 2.26 - US$1 (selling). Bolivia formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from June 5, 1967. Administration of Control The Central Bank of Bolivia is in charge of operating the auction market for foreign exchange. It is also the enforcing agency for export surrender requirements as well as for other exchange control regulations. The Ministry of Finance, together with the Central Bank, is in charge of approving public sector purchases of foreign exchange for debt service payments. Arrears are main- tained with respect to external paymen ts. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Settlements are usually made in U.S. dollars or other convertible currencies. Payments between Bolivia and Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Bank of Bolivia and the central bank of the country concerned, within the framework of the multi- lateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Imports and Import Payments All goods may be freely imported, with the exception of sugar (temporarily subject to licensing requirements) and those controlled for reasons of public health or national security. Since August 1986 imports have been subject to a uniform tariff of 20 percent. Importers are also required to pay an inspection charge of 1.3 percent of the f.o.b. value of imports. Import duties on capital goods are payable over a three-year period with a one-year grace period, rather than on importation. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments for invisibles. Public sector purchases of foreign exchange for debt service must be approved by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. Residents of Bolivian or foreign na- tionality must present a certificate of tax settlement (certificado de solvencia tributarid) when leaving the country. The fee for the certificate is Bs 500 for air travel to neighboring countries, Bs 250 for overland travel to such countries, Bs 1,000 for air travel to other Latin American countries, and Bs 1,500 for air travel to coun- tries outside Latin America. Outward remittances of profit are governed by the provisions of Decision Nos. 24 and 80 of the Cartagena Agreement. Exports and Export Proceeds All goods may be freely exported. All proceeds from exports of the public and private sectors must be sold to the Central Bank at the official exchange rate within three days of receipt, with the exception of reasonable amounts deducted for foreign exchange expenditures undertaken to effect the export. Exporters of traditional products receive a rebate equivalent to 5 percent of the f.o.b. value of exports on the surrender of foreign exchange receipts. The rebate rate for exporters of nontraditional products is 10 percent. As regards minerals, COMIBOL and the medium-sized mines export their own production, and the Mining Bank exports the production of the small private mines. All exports of goods and services must be effected through documentary letters of credit drawn on domestic banks. Proceeds from Invisibles Banks, exchange houses, hotels, and travel agencies may retain the proceeds from their foreign exchange 111 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BOLIVIA purchases from invisible transactions, including those from tourism. They are required, however, to report daily their purchases on account of these transactions. Capital Foreign exchange for outward capital transfers by residents or nonresidents can be purchased only from the banks or from the Central Bank. Inward capital transfers may be made freely, but government receipts of transfers and grants and all proceeds of borrowings from foreign public sector agencies must be surrendered to the Central Bank. All foreign credits, including suppliers' credits, to government agencies and autonomous entities and credits to the private sector with official guarantees are subject to prior authorization by the Ministry of Finance and to control by the Central Bank. Under Supreme Decree No. 19732 of August 11, 1983, financial institutions in Bolivia may make loans in the form of credits denominated in foreign currency for imports of capital goods and inputs for the external sector with resources from international financial institutions, foreign government agencies, or external lines of credit. Under Supreme Decree No. 21060 of August 29, 1985, banks are authorized to conduct foreign trade operations such as letters of credit, bonds and guarantees, advances and acceptances, loans for the required financing with their correspondents abroad, and other operations generally accepted in international bank- ing, in favor of the country's exporters and importers. Foreign investments in Bolivia, except those involving petroleum and mining, are governed by the provisions of the Investment Law (Decree Law No. 18751) of Decem- ber 14, 1981. The law is administered by the National Investment Institute. Investments in petroleum and min- ing are governed by the General Hydrocarbons Law and Mining Code. Certain foreign investments are subject to Decision Nos. 24 and 103 of the Cartagena Agreement. Gold Under Supreme Decree No. 21060 of August 29, 1985, gold may be traded freely, subject to a tax of 1.5 percent. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments July 10. The interest-free deferment of import duty payments on capital goods was introduced. The du ty, which remains at a uniform rate of 20 percent, would be payable over three years with a one-year grace period. July 10. The preferential tariff rate of 2 percent for imports of the State Petroleum Company (YPFB) was withdrawn, and imports of YPFB were made subject to the uniform rate of 20 percent that applies to most imports. Exports and Export Proceeds July 10. An export subsidy system was introduced, under which exporters receive rebate certificates (Certi- ficado de Reintegro Arancelario, CRA) equivalent to 5 percent of the f.o.b. value of traditional exports (mainly minerals) and 10 percent of nontraditional exports (mainly agricultural products). A number of products, represent- ing about one half of total exports (e.g., natural gas, petroleum, gold, unprocessed lumber, and re-exports), would not receive rebates. Exporters would receive rebates at the time of exchange surrender instead of at the time of exportation. The export rebate system was supplemented by reduced railway fares for exports. 112 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BOTSWANA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Botswana is the Botswana Pula, which is pegged to a basket of currencies consisting of a weight of 65 percent for the South African rand and of 35 percent for the SDR. On December 31, 1987 the closing middle rate for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, was P 1.5657 per US$1; on the same date, the rate for the SDR was P 2.2172 per SDR 1. Exchange rates for certain other currencies1 are quoted on the basis of their rates against the U.S. dollar in international markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. External borrowings by parastatals are protected from exchange rate movements under a Foreign Exchange Risk Sharing Scheme. Risk associated w i th up to 4 percent fluctuations in the exchange rate is fully borne by the borrower. The Government bears one half and three quarters, respectively, of the risk associated with ex- change rate fluctuations of between 5-10 percent and 11-16 percent. Risk associated with exchange rate fluc- tuations exceeding 16 percent is fu l ly borne by the Governmen t. Forward exchange cover is also offered by the commercial banks. The period for which forward cover may be given in respect of the foreign currency proceeds from exports of goods is six mon ths. Administration of Control Exchange control is applicable to transactions with all countries. The Minister of Finance and Development Planning has delegated most of the administration of exchange controls to the Bank of Botswana (the central bank). The latter, in tu rn, has delegated certain powers to banks appointed as authorized dealers. Prescription of Currency Payments to or from residents of foreign countries must normally be made or received in a foreign currency or through a non-resident-held pula account in Botswana. Botswana does not maintain any bilateral payments agreement. Imports and Import Payments Botswana is a member of a customs union w i th Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland, and there are generally no import restrictions on goods moving between the four countries. Import permits are required, however, for most goods imported directly into Botswana from outside the customs un ion. Certain imported goods, including fire- arms, ammun i t ion, fresh meat, and some agricultural and horticultural products, require permits regardless of the country of supply. There are no restrictions or delays on payments for authorized imports. Goods of domestic origin may move freely between Botswana, Malawi, and 1 Deutsche mark, pounds sterling, South African rand, and Zimbabwe dollars. Zimbabwe by virtue of a customs agreement of 1956, provided they are not intended for re-export. Applications in respect of forward purchases of foreign currency to cover payment for imports when the contract covers a period exceeding six months must be referred to the Bank of Botswana. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports are subject to licensing, mainly for revenue reasons. Proceeds from exports must be received in a foreign currency or from a nonresident pula account. For a few items, such as precious and semiprecious stones, permits are required before export is allowed. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments to nonresidents for current transactions, while subject to control, are not restricted. Authority to approve a range of current payments within limits is delegated to commercial banks. The basic exchange allowance for tourist travel is the equivalent of P 5,000 a calendar year for an adult (P 2,000 for a child). The allowance for business travel is P 250 a day, up to a maximum of P 10,000 a calendar year. The annual limit on outward remittances by a temporary resident on contract is P 10,000 or 50 percent of eligible salary, whichever is greater; for a self-employed temporary resident, the limit is P 10,000. Separately, travelers may take out domestic bank notes and foreign currency in an amount of P 200 and P 300, respectively, and may freely bring in any amount of domestic bank notes and coin. The Bank of Botswana may authorize the maintenance by residents of foreign currency accounts with banks abroad in proven cases of commercial need for such a facility. Authorized dealers may approve payment of dividends to nonresidents up to P 30,000 a year a company. Capital Applications to make investments abroad are treated on their merits and in light of possible benefits to Bo- tswana. Foreign inward inves tment in new or existing businesses is generally encouraged. The policy has been altered whereby any local borrowing in excess of P 100,000 by non-resident-controlled companies must be matched by nonresident funds in the company on a 1:1 ratio; with effect from October 13, 1986, the ratio was changed to a 3:1 debt-to-equity ratio. Equity is defined as paid-up capital, reserves, and retained earnings. This ratio is variable, but must be at least 3:1. Any external borrowing by a local business must have at least a three-month grace period (the previous requirement was a two-year grace period). Departing temporary residents are entitled to a basic remittable terminal allowance of up to P 10,000. Permanent residents are eligible for an emigration allow- ance of up to P 100,000. The balance of assets is normally permitted to be remitted in equal installments over three years from the date of departure. 113 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution BRAZIL (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Brazil is the Cruzado (Cz$). Brazil follows a flexible exchange rate policy under which the exchange rate for the cruzado is adjusted on a daily basis in terms of its intervention currency, the U.S. dollar. Exchange transactions are carried out by the Central Bank of Brazil and by banks and tourist agencies au- thorized to deal in foreign exchange; the tourist agencies deal only in bank notes and traveler's checks in a "manual market." Uniformity between the rates quoted by the Central Bank and the effective rates of the Central Bank is ensured by the Central Bank's practice of standing ready to purchase exchange from the banks and to sell it to the banks at the official rate for approved transactions. On December 31,1987 the buying and selling rates quoted by the Central Bank to the public were Cz$71.89 and Cz$72.25, respectively, per US$1. The same exchange rates are applicable to "agreement dollars" used for settlements with bilateral agreement countries. Rates for other currencies are based on the U.S. dollar rates in Brazil and the rates for the respective currencies in New York and Europe. With specified exceptions, foreign exchange transactions are subject to brokerage fees, calculated on a sliding scale, which result in effective rates of up to 3/i6 of 1 percent on either side of the rates set by the Central Bank. A different effective rate arises, on the selling side, from the application of a financial transactions tax (im- posto sobre operaqoes de credito, cdmbio e seguro, e sobre operates relativas a titulos e valores mobiliarios) (IOF) of 25 percent to purchases of foreign exchange for imports of goods and services (with specified exemptions). Global daily limits are fixed for the authorized banks' bought and sold positions in foreign exchange. The limits are fixed in relation to the registered capital of each bank: a bank having registered capital of up to Cz$500,000 may maintain a bought or sold position of up to US$750,000; over and above that financial base, a bank is allowed a bought position of US$1.5 million and a sold position of up to US$7.5 million. Banks that are authorized to operate exclusively in the manual market and tourist agencies are permitted to maintain a bought position of up to US$25,000 for each authorized branch, but may not maintain a sold position. The Central Bank supplies foreign exchange to authorized banks in amounts not exceeding those needed to eliminate an oversold position, and limited to 100 percent of the exchange sold by the bank concerned to its customers during the same day or on the previous day; included in this limit is their manual market position (bank notes and traveler's checks). The banks are per- mitted to sell foreign exchange to each other, subject to certain conditions; such transactions may be carried out either on a spot basis by cable or on a forward basis, and must be executed within 2 working days for spot trans- actions or not later than 180 days for forward transactions. The commercial banks are permitted to provide forward exchange facilities to exporters, usually for a period of up to 180 days. The banks provide daily forward quota- tions for foreign currencies, with forward premia reflecting corresponding interest differentials between the countries concerned. Commercial banks are subject to daily limits on bought and sold positions in foreign exchange. Administration of Control The National Monetary Council is responsible for the formulation of overall foreign exchange policy. In ac- cordance with the guidelines established by the Council, exchange controls, regulations affecting foreign capital, and the management of international reserves are under the jurisdiction of the Central Bank. Limits on interna- tional borrowing by the public sector are applied by the Secretariat for Control of Public Enterprises (SEST) in the Planning Secretariat of the Presidency of the Republic. The National Council of Foreign Trade (CONCEX), a board headed by the Minister of Finance, formulates foreign trade policy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the Council's executive organ for dealing with foreign countries, while the Foreign Trade Department of the Banco do Brasil S.A. (CACEX) implements the Council's decisions within Brazil. CACEX issues export and import certificates (guias de exportaqdo or declaraqoes de ex- portaqao and guias de importaqdo). Coffee exports are regulated by the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC). The Customs Policy Commission (CPA), established within the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for formulating guidelines for tariff policy. The CPA also decides on changes in customs duties under the provisions of existing legislation. The import policy of the public sector is coordinated by the Secretariat of Public Enterprises. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency In principle, prescription of currency is related to the country of origin of imports or the country of final destination of exports, unless otherwise prescribed or authorized. Settlements with bilateral payments agree- ment countries1 are made in clearing dollars through the relevant agreement account. Payments between Brazil and Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Vene- zuela must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Bank of Brazil and the other central banks concerned, within the framework of the 1 Bilateral payments agreements are maintained with Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, and Poland. Bilateral accounts are also maintained with Hungary and Romania, but settlements are made in third country currencies every 90 days, and interest rates payable on balances are based on the international capital market. 115 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BRAZIL multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Inte- gration Association (LAIA). Settlements with countries with which Brazil has no payments agreements or special payments arrangements are made in U.S. dollars or other freely usable currencies. Foreign Exchange Accounts Beginning October 30, 1986 exporters, importers, na- tional companies with foreign capital participation, and official institutions in the field of education and techno- logical research have been authorized to open foreign exchange accounts in U.S. dollars at the Central Bank. Accounts opened by exporters yield LIBO rate; with- drawals can be made once a month with 15 days' prior notice. Importers of goods financed abroad are allowed to open accounts within five days of issuance of the import certificate for the amount of foreign financing involved in the import operation. These deposits are remunerated at LIBO rate or the borrowing cost, which- ever is lower; only withdrawals for repayment of the foreign obligation are allowed. Companies whose foreign capital participation is registered at the Central Bank are authorized to open foreign exchange accounts while awaiting a decision to invest in Brazil. These accounts can be credited with funds from new foreign direct investments and reinvestments, reserve profits, consoli- dated surplus, profit remittances, and returns and gains from capital remittances. Deposits are remunerated at LIBO rate, and withdrawals require 90 days' prior notice, or 30 days in cases of deposits from profits or dividends and sales of investments and participating capital stocks. Imports and Import Payments All importers must be registered with CACEX and goods can only be imported by registered firms or persons. Imports may be grouped into the following three broad categories: (1) imports that are free of requirements to secure prior administrative documentation, including samples without commercial value and certain educational materials; (2) imports that require an import certificate, which is issued by CACEX if it conforms to a previously approved and binding annual import plan; and (3) prohib- ited imports, which include goods that are not licensed for reasons of security, health, or moral reasons, as well as for reasons of industrial policy. There is also a limitation on the direct import of consumer goods (and on the purchase on the domestic market of any imported consumer goods) by the public and semipublic sector (the Government, autonomous agencies, public enterprises, and companies with mixed public and private participation).2 Most imports require the prior approval of CACEX. Importers are required to submit to CACEX an annual binding import program as a basis for requesting import licenses. The Minister of Finance may, on a temporary 2 Under instructions issued by the Economic Development Council, federal ministries and subordinate agencies and public enterprises are required to subm i t, for approval by the President, an annual inves tment program incorporating their expected import requirements. 116 basis, and in accordance with the directives of the Economic Development Council and without prejudice to commitments under LAIA, authorize CACEX to reject applications for import certificates where: (1) imports are for speculative stock-building purposes; (2) imports are causing or are threatening to cause serious damage to the national economy for reasons other than those related to the balance of payments; or (3) imports originate in or are shipped from countries that impede Brazilian exports. Import certificates are issued on an f.o.b. basis. CACEX is authorized to levy a processing fee of up to 0.9 percent on the value of import certificates; as a rule, certificates are valid for 60 days, 90 days, or 180 days, depending on the product. For special bonded warehouse importers, CACEX establishes half-yearly foreign currency quotas and issues clearance certificates for certain groups of commodities. For a number of specified imports, the import certificate may be obtained after the commodity has been landed but before customs clearance. It is a prior condition for the granting of import certificates for most groups of commodities that importers arrange external financing with specified minimum ma- turities for the type of commodity and the amount of financing involved.3 CACEX grants exceptions from the specified financing terms for imports for projects aimed at import substitution or export production, imports with payment terms equivalent to those provided by foreign governments and bilateral or multilateral agencies, and imports by small or medium-sized firms. Certain products require the approval of the Special Secretariat for Information. For some commodities, eli- gibility for exemption from import duties may be pre- cluded by the existence of satisfactory domestic equiva- lents (similares nationals)'* application of such duties may also be affected by the establishment of a m in imum import price (pauta de valor mini mo) or of a reference price. Goods imported into the Manaus free zone are subject to an annual quota, which was set at US$702 million for 1987. The transfer to other parts of Brazil (as a passenger's baggage) of foreign goods originally imported into the Manaus free zone is restricted to the equivalent of US$600 free of import taxes. As a general rule, imports may be cleared through customs before an exchange contract is closed. CACEX may approve applications for the payment of imports of any goods at terms of up to 360 days from the date of shipment without authorization from the Central Bank. External financing at terms in excess of 360 days for imports must be authorized by the Central Bank, which will evaluate them in the light of foreign debt policy. Payment of the amount financed, and the interest thereon, may be made only upon presentation of a certificate of authorization and the related scheme of paymen ts issued by the Department of Foreign Capital Supervision and Registration (FIRCE) of the Central Bank. Prior to ship- ment of the goods, total paymen ts to suppliers for the 3 Certain specified imports, inc lud ing direct imports by public admin- istrative bodies, are exempt from th is requ iremen t. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution nonfinanced amount may not exceed 10 percent of the import value. Spot exchange contracts can be closed if the contract is intended to settle drafts, at sight or on ma tu r i ty, and once the appropriate shipping documents are presented. Spot exchange contracts must be settled on maturity of the draft; settlement may take place two working days in advance of the ma tur i ty date. Exchange contracts for imports financed under letters of credit must be closed on the date of settlement or two working days in advance of the maturity date of the letters of credit. Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles related to income from foreign capital, royalties, and technical assistance are governed by the provisions of the Foreign Inves tment Law. In addition to certain restrictions on remittances stipulated in that law, limits are placed on remittances of all royalties and technical assistance fees (see below). Subject to certain conditions, authorized banks may sell foreign exchange up to the equivalent of US$300 a month for Brazilian residents temporarily staying abroad for educational and health purposes. Payments for other current invisibles require the approval of the Central Bank's Exchange Department (DECAM) or FIRCE, which authorizes remittances freely, subject to the presentation of supporting documents as evidence that a bona fide current transaction is involved. Sales of foreign exchange w i thout the prior approval of the Central Bank in respect of personal expenses connected with travel abroad are permitted up to US$1,000 a person 12 years of age or older; for trips to or initial stopover in Central or South America, the amount is US$500. In both cases, the total amount can be provided in cash, traveler's checks, or in the form of payment orders. The basic allowances are one half of the preceding amounts for minors between the age of 2 and 12 years; no allowances are available for infants up to the age of 2 years. A special allowance of US$20,000 a year is available for the travel and representation expenses abroad of firms whose annual exports total at least US$200,000. Appli- cations for purchases of foreign exchange for travel in excess of these limits must be submitted to the Central Bank, which considers each case on its merits. Remittances abroad of income from foreign direct investments and reinvestments and remittances in respect of royalties and technical assistance are governed by Decree No. 55762 of February 17, 1965, which contains the regulations implementing the Foreign Inves tment Law. Remittances are allowed only when the foreign capital concerned, including reinvestments, and the con- tracts for patents and trademarks, and for technical, scientific, and administrative assistance, are registered at FIRCE in accordance with the established rules (see section on Capital, below). The registration of contracts or deeds for technical assistance or the use of patents or trademarks is subject to approval by the National Institute of Indus- trial Property. Remittances are normally authorized in the currency of the country of domicile or of the head BRAZIL office of the beneficiaries. Remittances of interest on loans and credits and of related amortization payments are permitted freely in accordance with the terms stipu- lated in the respective contract and recorded in the certificate of registration; the remittances are subject to withholding tax on income at a rate of 25 percent or other rate determined under agreement between Brazil and other countries for the purpose of avoiding double taxation. Remittances of royalties by a branch or subsidiary established in Brazil to its head office abroad are not permitted when 50 percent or more of the local firm's voting capital is directly or indirectly held by the foreign principal firm or when the majority of the firm's capital in Brazil belongs to the recipients of the royalties abroad. Remittances of technical assistance fees (either with or without the use of trademarks and patents) are not permitted, as a rule, when remuneration for such services exceeds specified percentages, ranging from 1 percent to 5 percent, of net receipts from the sale or manufacture of the products. The percentages are the same as those established in Brazil's taxation laws for determining the maximum permissible deductions for such expenses. Purchasers of foreign exchange for a number of current invisibles are subject to the financial transactions tax (IOF) of 25 percent. Travelers may take out domestic and foreign bank notes freely. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports are free of licensing requirements but require an export certificate (guia de exportaqdo or declaraqoes de exporta^do) issued by CACEX to ensure compliance with exchange and trade regulations. Some exports are free of controls, but exports of many commodities require prior approval of CACEX, while exports of specified commodities, including certain primary products and raw materials required for domestic consumption, are prohib- ited or suspended, and exports of certain other commod- ities are conditional on prior domestic sales. Exports requiring approval include those effected through bilateral accounts, exports without exchange cover, exports on consignment, re-exports, commodities for which mini- mum export prices are fixed by CACEX, and exports requiring prior authorization by government agencies. Exports of certain commodities are subject to an annual quota. Exports of coffee are subject to authorization by the IBC. The IBC does not grant an authorization to export coffee unless the sales contract is based on a price that is at least equal to the minimum registration price (in U.S. dollars a pound, f.o.b.) fixed periodically by the IBC for the various types of coffee, although discounts are also authorized. During 1987 the IBC continued to make periodic announcements of minimum registration prices for exports of soluble coffee and green, ground- roasted, and decaffeinated coffee, although not necessar- ily changing them. Coffee exports are subject to a con- tribution quota at a rate that is changed regularly by the IBC depending on market prices. The exporter must pay 117 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BRAZIL 50 percent of the contribution quota no later than three days after the export operation is registered and 50 percent no later than one day after the coffee is shipped. The foreign exchange proceeds from all exports are sold at freely negotiated rates within the limits of the official market. Exporters of gems and other precious stones are allowed to obtain gold from the Central Bank in exchange for their export receipts. Foreign exchange contracts covering export transactions may be closed either prior to the shipment of goods or within ten working days after shipment. The export of hides of wild animals in any form is suspended. A number of export incentives are in operation, prin- cipally for manufactured commodities. Certain exporters of manufactured goods are eligible for a tax credit on indirect federal and state value-added taxes according to the terms of contracts signed prior to July 1982 under the Special Program of Tax Benefits for Exporters (BEFIEX). Firms signing new BEFIEX contracts are not eligible for the credits. For a number of exports to the United States (primarily textiles, leatherware, footwear, and certain steel products), export taxes of 0.6-27.4 percent are levied. For exports of ladies' footwear to all destinations, a tax of 2.2 percent is levied. In 1987 export taxes at different rates were levied on a number of other products, irrespective of destination. Various financing programs for exporters, some at preferential rates of interest, are provided by the Banco do Brasil S.A. and the commercial banks. These financing facilities include both export financing and the financing of production and warehousing for export, particularly for manufactures. In addition, assistance is provided to exporters in the field of export credit insurance and by way of guarantees. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange proceeds from current invisibles must be sold through the authorized banks at the prevailing market rate. Traveler's checks and foreign bank notes are sold in the manual market. Travelers may freely bring in domestic and foreign currency notes. Capital Capital inflows in the form of financial loans under National Monetary Council Resolution No. 63, as amended, or under the provision of the Foreign Investment Law (Law No. 4131) are subject to ceilings and require the prior approval of the Central Bank. The prior approval of the Central Bank is required for borrowing by the private or public sector when the foreign funds originate from official financial institutions abroad, when the trans- action is to be guaranteed by the National Treasury or, on its behalf, by any official credit institution, and for other foreign borrowing by the public and semipublic sector (i.e., the Government, autonomous agencies, pub- lic enterprises, and companies with mixed public and private participation). In addition, prior approval by the Central Bank is required for borrowing by the private sector when the foreign funds originate from financial institutions abroad. Otherwise, inward transfers are un- 118 restricted and free of control, although the subsequent utilization of the proceeds for the acquisition of certain domestic assets may be subject to control. There is a separate regime for inward portfolio inves tmen t. For the purpose of repatriation and the remittance of income, however, inward transfers of foreign capital and the reinvestment of profits on foreign capital must be regis- tered with FIRCE. Foreign capital is defined for this purpose as (1) goods, machinery, and equipment to be used to produce goods or to render services that have entered the country without an initial corresponding expenditure of foreign exchange; and (2) financial and monetary resources brought into the country for invest- ment in economic pursuits, provided that, in either case, the owner is a person or firm resident or domiciled abroad or with headquarters abroad. Foreign capital other than capital invested in Brazilian securities is classified, for purposes of registration, as direct investments or loans, whether imported in the form of money or of goods, and it includes reinvested profits from foreign capital. Direct investment is defined as that foreign capital which constitutes part of the corporate capital and participates directly in the risk inherent in an economic undertaking. Foreign capital that is not part of the corporate capital of any enterprise is considered to be a loan. Any loan obtained to purchase capital goods abroad, whether contracted by the manufacturer himself or by a third party, is considered to be financing (mostly suppliers' credit). Persons domiciled or resident abroad may make port- folio investments in Brazilian commercial and industrial securities indirectly by acquiring shares in a Brazilian "investment company" quoted on Brazilian stock ex- changes. Such capital is subject to registration with the Central Bank and must remain in the country for at least three months. The m in imum participation in portfolio investment companies by foreign firms or individuals is US$1,000. Portfolio investments are exempted from the capital gains tax. Portfolio inves tmen ts may also be made through the purchase of quotas of the "Investment Fund- Foreign Capital." The m in imum participation in this fund is US$5,000, and the money must stay in the country at least three months. Funds and other collective investment entities established abroad may maintain, in Brazil, a portfolio of bonds and other securities, once its consti- tution and administration have been previously approved by the Central Bank and the securities and exchange commission. For financial imports and for investments made in the form of goods, the registration is in the currency of the country of domicile of the creditor or investor (or of its head office) or, in special circumstances, in the currency of the country of origin of the goods or of the credit. To register loans that are made in foreign currency, it is necessary to certify that the interest rate corresponds to that prevailing in the original market of the loan, that the amortization schedule is not disproportionately heavy in the early stages of repayment, and, in the case of import financing loans, that the prices of the imported goods ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution correspond to the prices of comparable goods in the country of origin. Capital entering Brazil is registered in foreign currency. Reinvestments are defined as profits of companies estab- lished in Brazil and accruing to persons or companies resident or domiciled abroad when they have been reinvested in the same companies that produced them or in another sector of the Brazilian economy. The registra- tion of reinvested profits is made simultaneously in Brazilian currency and in the currency of the country to which the profits could have been remitted. The conver- sion is calculated at the average exchange rate prevailing between the date on which the profits appeared on the balance sheet of a company and the date of their rein- vestment. A progressive supplementary income tax is levied on distributions of profits and dividends to non- residents in excess of 12 percent of registered capital over a three-year period; the tax is applied whether or not the profits are remitted abroad, but reinvested earnings are exempt. Special regulations govern borrowing abroad. Under National Monetary Council Resolution No. 63, as amended, private, commercial, inves tmen t, and development banks and the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social may be authorized to take up foreign currency credits abroad for domestic relending for purposes of financing working capital. Safeguards against excessive use of such credits include limitations on the foreign obligations that each bank may assume (related to the terms of the credit and the size of the bank) and the provision that the ultimate borrower must agree to bear the exchange risk. The Central Bank assumes responsi- bility for the availability of cover for the repatriation of the loan at maturity. All other financial loans in foreign currency are effected under the general provisions of the Foreign Investment Law (Law No. 4131). Loans under this law also require prior central bank authorization, but the Central Bank does not undertake to provide specific exchange cover for them. Loans under Resolution No. 63, as well as those under Law No. 4131, must have a minimum term of seven years, but no maximum term is set. Foreign loans are subject to mandatory deposit at the Central Bank. In the case of private enterprises, the deposit is applicable to 75 percent of the loan proceeds converted into cruzados, and it is released as follows: one third after 60 days from the deposit date, another one third after. 90 days, and the balance after 120 days; for public enterprises, the deposit is applicable to 100 percent of the loan proceeds converted into cruzados and is released as follows: 20 percent after 150 days from the deposit date, an additional fraction of 40 percent after 180 days, and the balance after 210 days. In addition to these mandatory deposit regulations, on June 23, 1977 the Central Bank authorized voluntary deposits at the Central Bank by financial and nonfinancial institutions of the outstanding balances of their foreign loans; these deposits may be released only on the maturity dates for payment of principal, interest, and commissions. For as long as the deposit remains with the Central Bank, BRAZIL the Central Bank covers all costs on these loans, including the exchange cost. As part of the measures announced on September 12, 1984, these provisions were modified as follows: (1) voluntary deposits at the Central Bank in respect of nonfinancial loans (under Law No. 4131) were frozen for an indefinite period, except for (a) funds required for interest and amortization payments on the deposited loan funds, (b) transformation of such loans into direct investment, or (c) in certain special cases, upon the prior approval of the Central Bank; and (2) 80 percent of the balance of voluntary deposits at the Central Bank in respect of financial loans (under Resolution No. 63), which could be released until December 31, 1984, were frozen for an indefinite period—the balance of 20 percent as well as similar deposits made after this date could be withdrawn within an initial period of 60 days, and subsequently within 180 days from deposit dates; where the funds are for use in the rollover of loans to domestic enterprises, prior notice of 15 days is required. Under a program for the management of external debt, the National Monetary Council imposes quantitative limits on the amount of financial loans for which authorization may be given by the Central Bank. Loans are authorized only if maturities conform with minimum requirements established from time to time by the Central Bank, which permits the total of loans outstanding to rise only to the extent that the servicing commitments on Brazil's total external indebtedness do not depart from the guidelines set by the National Monetary Council. As of the end of 1986 the Central Bank's minimum acceptable maturity was set at seven years. However, provided that the full amount of the foreign exchange remains committed to Brazil for the minimum specified maturity, loans to the final borrower in Brazil, as well as loans to banks under Resolution No. 63, may be made at terms shorter than the final maturity of the debt abroad, and these funds may subsequently be re-lent to the same or a second borrower. Under the provisions of debt rescheduling agreements, a similar mechanism applies to the foreign exchange equivalent of affected principal repayments originally falling due during 1983-85. The resources de- posited in the Central Bank, originating from the install- ments of the principal due in 1986-87, may not be re-lent to national borrowers, but only be transformed into equity investment. Outward capital transfers not mentioned above require authorization by DEC AM and FIRCE, which consider ap- plications on their merits. Approved exchange transac- tions involving outward transfers of private capital are effected through authorized banks at the prevailing official market rate. Gold Firms authorized by the Government may freely pur- chase, hold, and sell gold in Brazil under Decree No. 1,038 of October 21, 1969. Gold mining is conducted under Law No. 4425 of October 8,1964. The first domestic negotiation of newly mined gold is subject to a mining tax of 1 percent, plus FINSOCIAL (an income tax surcharge 119 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BRAZIL and a sales tax) (0.5 percent) and PIS/ (Programa de Integracao) PASEP (Assisttencia Social de Empregados Publicos) fees (0.75 percent), due on each transaction, unless the operation takes place in the financial market when the said fees are due on the profits of the firm. The Central Bank is empowered to buy and sell gold on the domestic market at domestic prices. (Resolution CMN 1182 of April 4, 1986.) Purchases of gold are made at current domestic prices; the international price is consid- ered as a target price. Imports of gold are subject to the issuance of an import certificate by the Central Bank. Exports of gold are subject to authorization by the Central Bank, which is always the alternative buyer.

Not for Redistribution BURKINA FASO (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Burk ina Faso is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 - F 0.02. The official buy ing and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.1 per mill for transfers from countries outside the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) and one of 2.5 per mill for transfers to such countries.2 Banks levy a commission of 2.5 per mill on transfers to all countries ou ts ide the WAMU, part of which must be surrendered to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. In the official and commercial banking sectors, forward exchange cover may only be arranged by residents for settlements with respect to imports of goods on specified lists. All contracts for forward exchange cover must be denominated in the currency of paymen ts stipulated in the contract, and they are subject to the prior authorization of the Minister of Finance. Forward exchange contracts may be concluded for a period of one mon th and may not be renewed; for certain products, the maturity period of forward exchange cover may be renewed once for a period of three mon ths. With the exception of measures relating to gold and to the repatriation of export proceeds, Burk ina Faso's ex- change controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Ben in, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Com- oros, the Congo, Cote dTvo ire, Equatorial Guinea, Ga- bon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all pay- ments to these countries may be made free ly. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of the Treasury in the Ministry of Finance. The approval authority in respect of exchange control (except for imports and exports of gold, forward exchange cover, opening of external accounts in foreign currency, and business travel allocations in excess of CFAF 400,000) has been delegated to the BCEAO and, w i th in limits specified in the exchange control regulations, to autho- rized intermediaries. The BCEAO is also authorized to 1 The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de TAfr ique de TOuest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Ben in, Bu rk ina Faso, Cote d' lvo ire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2 Transfers between member countries of the Un ion are subject to a flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO. collect, either directly or through banks, financial insti- tutions, the Postal Administration, and judicial agents, any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks, the Postal Administration, or the BCEAO. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate-General of Com- merce in the Ministry of Commerce and Supply. Import certificates for liberalized commodities and export attes- tations are made out by the importer or exporter himself and, when settlement takes place with a country outside the French Franc Area, are visaed by the Customs Administration. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Since Burk ina Faso is an Operations Account coun try, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any Operations Account country. Current transactions with The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Ni- geria, and Sierra Leone are normally settled through the West African Clearing House. Certain settlements with the People's Republic of China, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Ghana3 are channeled through special accounts. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected either through correspondent banks in France, or the country concerned, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs (or in other currencies of the French Franc Area) through Foreign Accoun ts in Francs. All settlements with South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BCEAO bank notes may be credited to Foreign Accounts in Francs when they have been mailed to the BCEAO agency in Ouaga- dougou by an authorized bank 's foreign correspondent. Otherwise, the crediting to nonresident accounts of BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is prohibited. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, w i thout prior au- thorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes mailed directly by authorized intermediaries to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments Imports of goods originating in or shipped from any country for commercial purposes and under any customs regulations may be made freely; however, for the purpose 3 A bilateral agreement was negotiated with Ghana in 1970 but is inoperative. 121 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BURKINA FASO of monitoring, prior acquisition of an official import document may be necessary for imports exceeding an amount specified by the Minister of Commerce and Supply; an import license is required for those products subject to quota, and a prior import authorization is required for all other products. For imports subject to quota, a special commission (Commission des Importations) fixes the quotas and allocates them among importers. All other imports may require prior authorization, depending on the circum- stances. Noncommercial imports require a special au- thorization, to be obtained in advance from the Ministry of Commerce and Supply. Imports of goods subject to special controls require the prior approval of the com- petent ministry. On the other hand, imports of certain products, a list of which is established by decree, may be exempted from the import document requirement. The Minister of Commerce and Supply may, on the basis of criteria established by his Ministry, waive the prescribed formalities for imports from countries with which Burkina Faso has concluded a customs union or free trade area agreement. Most imports are subject to a customs stamp tax of 6 percent, an import surcharge of 6 percent, and a statistical du ty of 4 percent. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000. Import licenses or import certificates entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange not earlier than eight days before shipment, if a documentary credit is opened, on the due date for payment, if the commodities have already been imported, or at the time of the payment on account, if such a payment has to be made prior to the import. Payments for Invisibles All payments to South Africa are prohibited. Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to exchange control approval, which for many invisibles has been delegated to the authorized intermediaries. Authorized intermediary banks and the Postal Administration are empowered to make payments up to CFAF 50,000 a transfer to foreign countries on behalf of residents without requiring justi- fication. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Trans- fers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted. Residents traveling for tourism to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries may purchase exchange equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a person a trip (CFAF 87,500 for children under 10 years) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange in excess of CFAF 5,000 remaining after return to Burkina Faso must be surrendered. The basic allocation for travel abroad for business purposes is the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a day, with a maximum of CFAF 400,000 a trip. Larger allocations are granted, 122 however, for bona fide reasons. Residents traveling to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other Operations Account countries. Res- idents traveling to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes, but if proceeding to a country that is not a member of the WAMU, they must declare to customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers may freely take out foreign bank notes up to the equivalent of CFAF 175,000, or any larger amount, if declared upon entry or acquired by drawing on a Foreign Account in Francs, or an Account in Foreign Currency, or by exchange of foreign traveler's checks, etc. They may take out any foreign means of payment other than bank notes acquired in Burkina Faso by debit to a Foreign Account in Francs or an Account in Foreign Currency, subject to submission of documentation. They may also take out freely up to CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other Operations Account countries. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports and re-exports from Burkina Faso may be made freely. However, for the purpose of monitoring, exports or re-exports of certain products may require prior official authorization by the competent services of the Ministry of Commerce and Supply, except in the case of certain goods, a list of which is established by decree. In accordance with criteria defined by the Minister of Commerce and Supply, exports of certain products may be subject to special regulations. Exports of any product may require prior special authorization from the compe- tent services of the Ministry of Commerce and Supply, depending on circumstances. Exports to Ghana are sub- ject to special regulations. Export proceeds must be surrendered within one month of the date on which the payment falls due (the due date stipulated in the com- mercial contract, which must not, in principle, be later than 180 days after arrival of the goods at their destina- tion). All export transactions relating to foreign countries, including countries in the French Franc Area, must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000, and the exporter must sign a foreign exchange commitment and submit an export attestation form. Most exports are subject to a customs stamp tax of 6 percent and a statistical duty of 3 percent. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered within two months of the due date.

Capital All capital movements between Burk ina Faso and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between Bur- kina Faso and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward inves tmen t, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Burkina Faso. Such operations require prior authorization by the Min- ister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Burkinabe Governmen t, and (2) shares that are similar to or may be substituted for securities whose issue, advertising, or sale in Burkina Faso has already been authorized. With the exception of controls over foreign securities, these measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, member countries of the WAMU, and the Operations Account countries. Special controls are maintained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit with foreign private persons and foreign firms and insti- tutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate and building operations abroad; these special controls also apply to France, Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All the special provisions described in this paragraph apply only to transactions and not to the associated payments or collections. All investments abroad by residents of Burkina Faso require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance4 and unless specifically exempted by the Minister of Finance, 75 percent of such inves tmen ts must be financed from borrowings abroad. Foreign direct investments in Burkina Faso5 must be declared to the Minister of Finan- cial Resources before they are made. The Minister has a period of two mon ths from receipt of the declaration during which he may request postponement of the project. The full or partial liquidation of either type of investment also requires prior declaration to the Minister.

Direct investments constitute inves tmen ts im- plying control of a company or enterprise. Mere partici- pation is not considered as direct inves tmen t, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Foreign firms operating in Burkina Faso in vital or priority sectors are required to have Burkinabe participation in their capital of at least 51 percent and of at least 35 percent in all other sectors. The sale to residents of Burkina Faso of securities of foreign companies operating in Burkina Faso requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance, who establishes the sale value. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct inves tmen t, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) loans taken up by industrial firms to finance operations abroad, by any type of firm to finance imports into or exports from Burkina Faso, or by international trading houses previously approved by the Minister of Financial Re- sources to finance international merchanting transactions; (3) loans contracted by authorized banks; and (4) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans, including the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 100 million for any one borrower, provided that the annual interest rate does not exceed the normal market rate and that the proceeds are imme- diately surrendered by the sale of foreign currency on the exchange market or debited to a Foreign Account in Francs. The repayment of loans not constituting a direct investment requires the special authorization of the Min- ister if the loan itself was subject to such approval but is exempt if the loan was exempt from special authorization. Lending abroad is subject only to exchange control authorization by the BCEAO, acting on behalf of the Minister of Finance. The Investment Code provides preferential treatment for foreign investment in Burkina Faso, except for enter- prises whose capital stock belongs entirely to foreigners. Three preferential categories (A, B, and C) are estab- lished, in accordance with which special guarantees and tax and customs incentives may be granted for up to eight years to any enterprise that undertakes to create or considerably expand activities likely to contribute to the coun try's economic and social development. Enterprises that the Government deems to be of a priority nature may also be given privileged treatment. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Burkina Faso. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from this requirement are: (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold 123 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution BURMA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Burma is the Burmese Kya t, which is pegged to the SDR at K 8.50847 = SDR 1. Burma applies margins of 2 percent in respect of spot exchange trans- actions, based on the fixed kyat-SDR rate. The buying and selling rates of the kyat for the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Japanese yen, the pound sterling, the Swiss franc, and the U.S. dollar, quoted by the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, are determined on the basis of the daily calculations of the value of these currencies against the SDR. On December 31, 1987 the buy ing and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were K 6.0492 and K 6.1702, respectively, per US$1. Buy ing and selling rates for the Belgian franc, the Italian lira, and the Netherlands guilder are determined on the basis of appropriate cross rates in the New York market; buying and selling rates for the Hong Kong dollar, the Malaysian ringgit, and the Sin- gapore dollar are determined weekly on the basis of appropriate cross rates in the Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore markets, respectively; and buy ing and selling rates for other currencies are based on appropriate cross rates in local markets (e.g., Bombay, for the Indian rupee). There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk operating in the official or the commercial banking sector. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Exchange Control Board, through the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, in accordance with instructions from the Ministry of Planning and Finance. A Foreign Exchange Control Committee headed by the Minister of Planning and Fi- nance is in charge of the allocation of foreign exchange. Prescription of Currency Burma maintains no bilateral payments agreements. Certain settlements with Bangladesh are channeled through a nonresident bank account at the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, and certain settlements with India are channeled through special rupee accounts in that country. Payments to other countries may be made in any foreign currency or by crediting kyats to an External Account in Burma. Receipts must be collected in convertible currencies or to the debit of an External Account in Burma. Nonresident Accounts Foreign exchange accounts may be kept with the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank by international organiza- tions, diplomatic personnel, or other foreign residents, subject to approval by the Exchange Control Board. Such accounts are normally held in deutsche mark, Indian rupees, pounds sterling, or U.S. dollars. They may be credited and debited freely, but no interest is payable on them. Foreign nationals temporarily resident in Burma are entitled to hold foreign exchange utilization cards for use in diplomatic shops. Nonresidents may be authorized to hold external accounts in kyats; all debits and credits to such accounts require prior authorization. Burmese nationals working abroad under permission from the Government may open accounts in U.S. dollars with the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, Rangoon, out of their savings; with exchange control approval, withdrawals from such accounts can be used for payment of personal imports and petty expenses. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. Also prohibited are imports of a few commodities from any source —principally opium and other narcotics, monkeys, playing cards, and gold and silver bullion. An import program is prepared annually as part of the foreign exchange budget drawn up by the Ministry of Planning and Finance. All imports involving use of official foreign exchange are made by the public sector through the Ministries. The Myanma Export-Import Corporation (MEIC) imports goods for the use of the private sector, whose requirements are estimated by the Central Trade Council. In general, state economic enterprises and de- partments import goods for their own use, including imports under loan and aid agreements, partly in their own names and partly in the name of the MEIC. Licenses are not required. A licensing fee of 5 percent of the c.i.f. value is levied on imports which are meant for resale, but imports for departmental use are exempted. Most imports are purchased on an f.o.b. basis, and shipments are made on vessels owned or chartered by the Burma Five Star Shipping Corporation whenever possible. All payments for imports are made through the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank. State economic enterprises obtain foreign exchange directly from the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank within the approved foreign exchange budget on endorsement by the respective ministries. Foreign ex- change allocations can be transferred by a ministry from one enterprise to another; transfers among ministries require cabinet approval. Imports not involving use of official foreign exchange do not require exchange control approval. Such imports for personal use generally do not require permits, but imports of certain durable items which are imported for personal use, such as cars, require specific permits. Burmese nationals working abroad as well as Burmese seamen are, however, permitted to import one vehicle every year. Seamen and other travelers may bring in a reasonable amount of personal goods when they enter the country. Payments for Invisibles There is no licensing for payments in connection with foreign trade handled by the public sector. All payments 125 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BURMA for invisibles outside the public sector are subject to licensing and are considered on a case-by-case basis. Payments for membership fees to educational or technical institutions abroad and payments for subscriptions to certain foreign periodicals are, as a rule, allowed freely. Family remittances are permitted on ly for foreign tech- nicians employed under contract by the Government, the limit being one half of the net salary if the wife is living abroad, and one third of the net salary if the wife is living in Burma. Outward remittances of insurance premium payments other than for the Myanma Insurance Corpo- ration are not permitted. The remittance of pension payments to retired government employees is permitted, only if the persons concerned had been nonnationals throughout their term of service, and are now residing in their native countries. Most personal money order re- mittances to neighboring countries through post offices are not permitted. Burmese nationals require official permission to travel abroad. Such permission may be granted for travel on official missions, for approved religious pilgrimages, or for approved employment abroad. Travel for medical reasons is authorized on a case-by-case basis, while travel for educational purposes is authorized only in connection with state scholarships. Tourist travel by Burmese na- tionals has been suspended. Residents who have been granted an official permit to travel abroad may take out freely the equivalent of K 100 in the currency of the country of destination or, if that currency is not available, in U.S. dollar notes. Nonresidents who have stayed in Burma for less than six months may, on leaving the country, take out any foreign currency they still hold and may also reconvert the remaining balance of the kyats obtained by conversion of foreign currency. Those who stay longer than six months must surrender all foreign currency in their possession but may be authorized by the Exchange Control Board to keep foreign currencies in foreign exchange accounts. The export of Burmese currency is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. There is also a list of prohibited exports comprising iron and steel, brass, copper, and aluminum and scrap thereof, foreign manufactures, and commodities of domestic origin which need to be conserved for domestic requirements. In practice, state agencies responsible for production may export any product in excess of the need for domestic consumption. Special permits are required for exports of antiques. Exports are generally effected by the MEIC, although timber, rubber, ju te, fish and fish products, coffee, hides and skins, minerals, and petroleum and petroleum products may be exported directly by the respective state economic enterprises. Rice is exported by the Agriculture and Farm Produce Trade Corporation in the name of the MEIC. Export proceeds must be obtained in a manner satisfactory to the exchange control authorities, i.e., in approved convertible currencies or by 126 debiting the kyat account of banks in the importing country, and surrendered to the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank within six months from the date of shipment. Certain exports are subsidized through the Export Price Equali- zation Fund Account. When exports are made on an f.o.b. basis, buyers are free to choose the carrier, but exports on a c.i.f. basis are usually shipped by the Burma Five Star Shipping Corporation or on vessels chartered or nominated by it. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered unless otherwise specified by special permission from the exchange control authorities, which may grant such per- mission to foreign nationals residing in Burma in connec- tion with official business. Travelers may bring in, subject to declaration, any amount in foreign currency; foreign nationals who intend to stay for more than six months must surrender all foreign exchange in their possession unless special permission is given to the contrary. The import of Burmese currency is prohibited. Burmese na- tionals working abroad under permission from the Gov- ernment are required to repatriate part of their gross earnings in foreign exchange. In the case of Burmese seamen serving abroad, the repatriation requirement is 50 percent of basic pay, and the kyat equivalent is credited to their bank accounts. Burmese nationals working abroad in international organizations and not subject to income tax are required to repatriate 10 percent of their gross earnings in foreign exchange; the kyat equivalent is credited to the accounts of such nationals or their families. Burmese nationals working abroad in private organiza- tions are required to remit as tax 10 percent of their gross earnings in foreign exchange through embassies in their country of residence. Capital There is no foreign investment code as such; in prin- ciple, investment proposals are considered by an Invest- ment Committee to ascertain whether the proposed en- terprise will utilize domestic raw materials, increase domestic employment, conserve foreign exchange, and generally conform to the economic plans of the Govern- ment. However, permission for foreign private investment in Burma has not been granted since 1963. All outward transfers of capital require prior approval. Residents are not permitted to remit funds abroad for investment. The repatriation of personal assets and the making of family remittances have been suspended, with minor exceptions, for foreign nationals employed in the private sector; those employed in the public sector may remit their personal savings when leaving the service. When the transfer abroad of payments in favor of non- residents is not permitted, the authorities can allow such payments to be credited to external accounts in kyats. All debits and credits to these accounts require prior permission. Individual licenses are required for the im- port, export, and transfer of securities involving nonres- ident interests. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Gold Residents may hold and trade in gold jewelry, gold coin, and unworked gold in Burma. Licenses for imports and exports of gold are not granted unless they are effected by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. i i f i u u u+ + r> Jewelry for personal wear may be brought into Burma, subject to customs declaration at the port of arrival. The export of personal jewelry is permitted under license, subject to the condition that the jewelry will be repatriated.

BURMA 127 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BURUNDI (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Burundi is the Burundi Franc, which is pegged to the SDR. In August 1986 Burundi introduced a flexible exchange rate system under which the exchange rate was to be adjusted periodically to reflect underlying economic conditions. On December 31,1987 the exchange rate was FBu 161 = SDR 1, and the official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were FBu 113.89 and FBu 115.04, respectively, per US$1. Exchange rates for 19 currencies1 are quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi (the central bank) on the basis of the Burundi franc/SDR rate and the transaction value of these curren- cies in terms of the SDR. Authorized banks must carry out permitted exchange transactions at the buying and selling rates established by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi for currencies quoted by that Bank. An exchange fee of 2 per mill is collected on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk operating in the official or the commercial banking sector. Administration of Control Control over foreign exchange transactions and foreign trade is vested in the Bank of the Republic of Bu rund i; authority to carry out some transactions is delegated to three authorized banks. Prescription of Currency Settlements relating to trade with Rwanda and Zaire in products specified in the commercial agreements between these countries are effected through convertible currency accounts maintained with the central bank and authorized banks of each signatory country. With these exceptions, outgoing payments may be made and receipts may be obtained in any currency quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident Accounts in Burundi francs may be main- tained, subject to the approval of the Bank of the Republic of Burundi, by (1) physical persons of foreign nationality, such as diplomats, who are temporarily established in Burundi and are not considered as residents, and (2) juridical persons of foreign nationality with special status, such as foreign embassies and international organizations. These accounts may be credited freely with the proceeds of foreign currencies quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi, and they may be debited freely for withdrawals of Burundi francs for any normal current payments in 1 Aus tr ian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish k rone r, deutsche ma rk, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kenya shillings, Ne the r lands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Rwanda francs, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, Tanzania shillings, Uganda sh i l l ings, U.S. dollars, and zaires. 128 Burundi and for conversion into foreign exchange (except bank notes). All other debits and credits require the approval of the Bank of the Republic of Burundi. These accounts do not bear interest and must not be overdrawn. Certain nonresidents may maintain Nonresident Ac- counts in Foreign Currencies with an authorized bank. The opening of such accounts requires the approval of the Bank of the Republic of Burundi and is restricted to (1) physical persons of foreign nationality who are resident abroad, and (2) juridical persons having branches or subsidiaries abroad. These accounts may be credited freely with any foreign currency quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi that is received from abroad. They may be debited freely for (1) conversion into Burundi francs for any paymen ts in Burund i, and (2) payments abroad for travel and representation or for the purchase of foreign goods, except for bank notes. These accounts cannot bear interest and must not be overdrawn; the related bank charges and commissions may be settled in Burundi francs. Imports and Import Payments All imports originating in or shipped from South Africa are prohibited. All imports require licenses, except (1) trade samples w i thout commercial value; (2) merchandise not intended for sale whose declared consumer value c. & f. Bu jumbu ra is FBu 50,000 or less; (3) traveler's personal effec ts; and (4) gifts and supplies for diplomatic missions and United Nations agencies. These licenses, used for purposes of payment and statistical control, are automatically granted. Authorization to import goods for sale using the importer's own foreign exchange is subject to prior payment of customs duties in foreign exchange. Such authorization is granted to approved importers in the form of licenses not involving purchase of official foreign exchange. Importers have been instructed not to order abroad certain goods of which domestic stocks are adequate or that are produced locally. Applications for licenses must be submitted to the Bank of the Republic of Burundi through an authorized bank. The approval of such an application also constitutes an authorization to obtain foreign exchange. With specified exceptions, authorized banks approve applications for licenses w i th a value not exceeding FBu 1 million (c. & f. point of landing); applications for amoun ts in excess of FBu 1 million require the approval of the Bank of the Republic of Burundi. A license is valid for eight months starting from the day of its validation, but extensions may be granted by the Bank of the Republic of Burund i. An administrative fee amounting to 1 percent of the f.o.b. value of the goods is collected at the time of validation of the license. All goods imported into Burundi must be insured by approved Burundi insurers, and premiums must be paid in Burundi f r an c s. All c o n s i g nm e n ts of impo r ts ex c e ed ing ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FBu 1 million in value (f.o.b.) are subject to presh ipment inspection w i th regard to qua l i ty, qu an t i ty, packaging, and price by international private agencies acting on behalf of the Bu rundi authorities. In principle, foreign exchange is made available at the time of shipment of the goods. For goods under global licenses, foreign exchange is not made available un t il after customs clearance. All imports are subject to a statistical tax of 4 percent ad valorem, in addition to any applicable customs duties and fiscal du t ies. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require approval. Shipping insurance on coffee exports normally must be taken out in Burundi francs w i th a Burundi insurer. Upon presen- tation of evidence of payment of taxes, foreign nationals residing and working in Burundi are permitted to transfer freely up to 50 percent of their net annual income. The permitted annual transfer is 60 percent of income for experts working for the Government under individual employment contracts containing a transfer clause and receiving remuneration entirely in Bu rundi francs. Private joint-stock companies may freely and immedi- ately transfer a portion of the re turn on foreign capital and of the share allocated to foreign directors, not exceeding 50 percent of the distributed profits for indus- trial and agricultural enterprises and 50 percent for com- mercial and service enterprises, net of corporation tax and the tax on capital income. Up to 50 percent of emoluments and dividends paid to foreign directors and auditors are transferable if the recipients are residents, and up to 100 percent if they are nonresidents. Requests for transfer of the balance of the profits are authorized subsequently as follows: 50 percent after two years of saving, 60 percent after four years, and 100 percent after five years. Profits awaiting remittance are required to be invested or saved at the Treasury, public agencies, public authorities, or financial institutions that manage savings; and interest earned on such deposits is eligible for transfer. However, these provisions are w i thout prejudice to any larger transfer guarantees granted by the Inves tment Code to enterprises that have been accorded special preferential status. Persons leaving Burundi permanently are authorized to transfer abroad their holdings of Burundi francs that consist of unremitted savings or the sale proceeds of their personal effects. Transfer of rental income from foreign owners of new commercial, industrial, and office buildings is permitted up to 50 percent of net rental income (after payment of taxes and deduction of 20 percent for main- tenance expenses); the remainder, plus any accrued interest, may be transferred later, provided that the funds have been held on deposit with a domestic financial institution for two years. Transfer of up to 50 percent is permitted after at least three years of placement in investment or savings bonds. Residents may apply for exchange needed for foreign travel. There is no fixed limit on the amount that may be allocated, which depends on the nature of the travel. All BURUNDI travelers may take out up to FBu 2,000 in Burundi bank notes. In addition, residents may freely purchase foreign travel tickets against payment in Burundi francs. Nonresidents staying in a hotel or guest house in Burundi must pay their hotel bills by selling foreign currencies quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi or by using a credit card. Payment in Bu rundi francs is, however, acceptable in the case of guests for whom a resident company or individual has assumed responsibility with prior authorization by the Bank of the Republic of Burund i, and in the case of nationals of Zaire or Rwanda who produce declarations of means of payment issued under the auspices of the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries (CEPGL). Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. All exports valued above FBu 10,000 require a prior declaration, which must be presented for certification by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi through an authorized bank. Declarations are valid for six months, but extensions may be granted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi. Payments must be collected within 90 days of the date of export declaration at the customs. All exchange proceeds from exports must be surrendered to an authorized bank w i th in eight days of their collection. Exports of arabica and robusta coffee from the Rumonge region are the monopoly of the Burundi Coffee Company. Virtually all exports are subject to export taxes; however, coffee exports have been exempt from the export tax since 1981. Exports of manufactured goods may receive a refund of du t ies paid, provided that they incorporate raw materials on which import du ty has been paid. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to authorized banks. Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign bank notes and up to FBu 2,000 in Burundi bank notes. Capital The Inves tment Code of August 25, 1967 provides tax and other benefits for domestic and foreign private in- vestors. A new Inves tment Law, adopted on Ju ly 10, 1986, revised some of the investment procedures. Under the Inves tment Code new investments that fulfill specified conditions as to amount and economic importance may be granted priority status to which specified privileges are attached, mainly in the form of exemptions from import duties and from taxes on income from the invest- men t. Import duties and taxes may be reduced or sus- pended for goods and equipment needed for starting a particular project and, during a period of five years, for other merchandise needed for the manufacturing process or for the upkeep of the original inves tmen t. Taxes on profits and real estate may likewise be reduced or sus- pended for up to eight years. Enterprises accorded priority status may be granted reduction or suspension of export taxes and import taxes on equipment and raw materials 129 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BURUNDI for renewable periods of five years. In addition to these privileges, companies undertaking investments that are considered to be of prime importance to Burundi's eco- nomic development may be granted, under a separate agreement, a guarantee that direct taxes on their activities will not be increased for ten years. An investment com- mission under the Planning Secretariat is responsible for examining requests for priority status and granting the necessary authorization. In addition, under the new law, Burundi guarantees each foreign investor the right to move into the country; foreign investors are also assured an allocation of foreign exchange for the purchase of raw materials abroad as well as for the repayment of loans taken out under the investment agreement. Capital transfers by residents and transfers of foreign capital on which a repatriation guarantee has been granted require individual authorization. The guarantee is fur- nished for foreign exchange imported by resident enter- prises to provide working capital in foreign exchange; it applies to any of the currencies quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi and is valid for a one-year period and is renewable. The guarantee provides for the transfer of the original amount surrendered at the official rate ruling on the day of transfer. Under the new law, Burundi also guarantees the repatriation of invested capital in the event of sale or shutdown of the business. Gold All physical or juridical persons holding gold mining permits issued by the Ministers responsible for Mining and Customs may open purchasing houses for gold mined by artisans in Burundi. Gold produced by artisans may be sold only to approved houses. Exports of gold must be declared in Burundi francs at the average monthly rates communicated by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi. Gold exports are authorized jointly by the Mining and Customs Departments. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement The external value of the Burundi franc was adjusted on three occasions between January 1, and March 16; from FBu 151.50 = SDR 1 on December 31, 1986 to FBu 161.00 = SDR 1 on March 16, 1987. Imports and Import Payments November 17. The validity period of import licenses was extended from four to eight months. Payments for Invisibles January 1. The share of income that foreign nationals residing and working in Burundi are permitted to transfer freely was increased to 50 percent. Similarly, the portion of the return on foreign capital and the share allocated to foreign directors that is permitted to be transferred freely was increased to 50 percent. 130 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CAMEROON (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Cameroon is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange trans- actions in French francs between the BEAC and com- mercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign curren- cies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market. A commission of 0.50 percent is levied on transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except transfers in respect of central and local government operations, payments for imports covered by a duly issued license domiciled with a bank, scheduled repayments on loans properly obtained abroad, travel allowances paid by the Government and its agencies for official missions, and payments of reinsurance premiums. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, Cameroon's exchange control measures generally do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, the Central African Re- public, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely, but all financial transfers in excess of CFAF 500,000 to countries of the French Franc Area must be declared to the authorities for statistical purposes. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of Economic Controls and External Finance in the Ministry of Finance. Exchange transactions relating to all countries must be effected through authorized intermediaries —that is, the Postal Administration and authorized banks. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Finance. Arrears are maintained with respect to ex- ternal payments. Prescription of Currency Since Cameroon is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements with all other countries are 1 The CFA franc circulating in Cameroon is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in the Central African Republic, Chad, the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. All settle- ments between Cameroon and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BEAC bank notes may be credited to Foreign Accounts in Francs when mailed to the National Directorate of the BEAC in Yaounde by the foreign correspondents of authorized banks. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. The import from all sources of certain "controlled" goods requires a special authorization (autorisation speciale d'importa- tiori), in addition to an import license. All other imports, irrespective of origin, are subject to licensing when valued at CFAF 500,000 or more (CFAF 1 million or more in the case of large retail stores), but licenses are issued freely. All import transactions must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 50,000. Import transactions by residents involving goods for use outside Cameroon must be domiciled with a bank in the country of final destination. Settlements for imports effected under an import license benefit from the autho- rization of uninterrupted transfer given to the authorized banks by the Ministry of Finance. Payments for Invisibles Payments in excess of CFAF 500,000 for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries require prior declaration but are per- mitted freely; those to other countries are subject to the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Payments for invis- ibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresi- dents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely, subject to declaration, when the basic transaction has been approved. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a person a year; any foreign exchange remaining after return to Cameroon must be surrendered. For business travel, the corresponding al- location is the equivalent of CFAF 15,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 450,000 a trip. In practice, additional allocations may be allowed. The transfer of rent from real property owned in Cameroon by foreign nationals is limited, in principle, to 50 percent of the income declared for taxation purposes, net of tax. Remittances for current repair and management 131 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CAMEROON of real property abroad are normally limited to the equivalent of CFAF 200,000 every two or three years. Depending on family status, the transfer of 20 percent or 50 percent of the salary of a foreigner working in Cam- eroon is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within one month of the pay period concerned. Except in the case of foreigners working in Cameroon temporarily, payments of insurance premiums to foreign countries are not permitted if the same type of insurance is available in Cameroon. Resident and nonresident travelers to coun- tries outside the French Franc Area may take out up to CFAF 20,000 in BEAC bank notes. Travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may, subject to prior declaration, take out any amount in BEAC bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign bank notes and coin up to the amount declared by them on entry, or up to CFAF 50,000 if no declaration was made. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Export transactions valued at CFAF 50,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Exports to all coun- tries are subject to domiciliation requirements for the appropriate documents. Proceeds from exports to all countries must be repatriated within 15 days of the payment date stipulated in the sales contract, and pro- ceeds received in currencies other than those of France or an Operations Account country must be surrendered within a month after collection. Payments for exports must be made within 30 days from the arrival date of the merchandise at its destination. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected within a month of the due date and surrendered within a month of collection if received in foreign cur- rency. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Capital Capital movements between Cameroon and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control. Capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Emigrants to countries outside the French Franc Area may transfer abroad their full savings, provided that they have met their tax obligations. With the exception of controls over the sale or intro- duction of foreign securities in Cameroon, the controls 132 on capital movements do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All foreign securities and titles em- bodying claims on nonresidents must be deposited with an authorized intermediary and be classified as foreign, whether they belong to residents or nonresidents. Direct investments abroad2 require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance, unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undis- tributed profits; the full or partial liquidation of such inves tmen ts requires only a report after the fact to the Minister of Finance, unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct investment abroad. Foreign direct inves tmen ts in Cameroon3 require prior declaration to the Minister of Finance, unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; the Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request postponement. The full or partial liquidation of direct inves tmen ts in Cameroon requires only reporting to the Minister of Finance, unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct investment in Cameroon. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Cameroonian investments abroad or foreign inves tmen ts in Cameroon, must be reported to the Minister of Finance within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as inves tmen ts implying control of a company or enter- prise. Mere participation is not considered as direct inves tmen t, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Cameroon requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and must subsequently be reported to h im. Exempt from authorization, however, and subject only to a report after the fact are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Cam- eroonian Government, and (2) shares similar to securities whose issue, advertising, or offering for sale in Cameroon has already been authorized. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private, whose normal residence or registered office is in Cameroon, or by branches or subsidiaries in Cameroon of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and must subsequently be reported to him. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization, and require only a report: (1) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with 2 Inc lud ing those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Cameroon and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Cameroon. 3 Including those made by companies in Cameroon that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Cameroon of foreign companies. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution the financing of commercial transactions either between Cameroon and countries abroad or between foreign coun- tries, in which these persons or firms take part; and (2) loans contracted by registered banks and credit institutions. Lending abroad by physical and juridical persons, whether public or private, whose normal residence or registered office is in Cameroon, or by branches or subsidiaries in Cameroon of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and must subsequently be reported to him. The following are, however, exempt from prior authorization, and require only a report: (1) loans constituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been obtained, as indicated above; (2) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commercial transactions either between Cameroon and countries abroad or between foreign coun- tries, in which these persons or firms take part; and (3) loans not exceeding CFAF 500,000, provided the maturity does not exceed two years and the rate of interest does not exceed 6 percent a year. Under the Investment Code promulgated in July 1984 and revised in 1985, four categories of fiscal benefits may be granted to foreign and domestic firms undertaking new projects in the agricultural, livestock, forestry, tourism, construction, public works, mining, and industrial equip- ment maintenance sectors. The Investment Code aims to promote sectors considered strategic in the development plan, to generate employment and foreign exchange, and to diversify economic activity geographically. The type and duration of benefits vary according to, inter alia, the size of the investment, the location of the enterprise, the economic activity undertaken, the factor mix, and the production techniques employed. Category A benefits, to last over a period o f t en years, apply to promotional enterprises investing over the period no less than CFAF 500 million and satisfying a number of prerequisites. The benefits consist of the reduction (to 5 percent) of taxes and duties on imported goods and their exemption on domestic purchases of equipment, spare parts, and raw materials. Category B benefits, which apply to firms in priority sectors investing no less than CFAF 2.5 billion, include, in addition to those under CAMEROON Category A, a number of other fiscal benefits related to property transfers and amortizations for a period of five years. Category C benefits apply to small- and medium- sized enterprises with an investment level of not more than CFAF 500 million over a ten-year period and are at least 65 percent Cameroonian-owned. Benefits include exemption from a number of asset and income levies. The duration of the benefits extends to 15 years for firms operating outside the areas of highest industrial concen- tration. Finally, under Category D, strategic firms in- vesting over CFAF 5 billion in 5 years may enjoy the same benefits as under Category B and are guaranteed the maintenance of the fiscal regime for 15 years. Ordi- nance No. 73/27 of August 30, 1973 provided that public entities should hold at least one third of the share capital of each banking institution and that the headquarters of each banking institution should be in Cameroon. This ordinance also required banks with foreign majority par- ticipation to submit to the monetary authorities infor- mation on all their current transactions abroad and to obtain prior approval for any changes in the structure of their equity holdings. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold jewelry in Cameroon. They require the approval of the Directorate of Mines to hold gold in any other form. Such approval is normally given only to industrial users, in- cluding jewelers. Newly mined gold must be declared to the Directorate of Mines, which authorizes either its exportation or its sale to domestic industrial users; exports are made only to France. Imports and exports of gold require prior authorization by the Directorate of Mines and the Minister of Finance, which is seldom granted for imports. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 133 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CANADA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Canada is the Canadian Dollar. The authorities of Canada do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and exchange rates are deter- mined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange market; however, the authorities intervene from time to time to maintain orderly conditions in that market. The principal intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. The closing interbank market rate for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1987 was Can$1.2993 per US$1. Forward exchange rates are similarly determined in the market, and it is not the practice of the authorities to intervene. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On March 25, 1952 Canada notified the Fund that it was prepared to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements are in force. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are required only for certain drugs; a few agricultural items; certain textile products, clothing, and footwear; certain endangered species of fauna and flora; natural gas; and material and equipment for the production or use of atomic energy. For some agricultural items, such as certain dairy products, licenses are gen- erally not issued. Commercial imports of certain com- modities from any source are tightly controlled or pro- hibited; the main products affected are oleomargarine and used automobiles. Imports of women's and girls' nonrub- ber footwear are subject to a global quota. Imports of clothing and certain textile products from low-cost sources are subject to bilateral agreements concluded under the Multifiber Agreement (MFA) that was negotiated within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Japan and the Republic of Korea monitor their automobile exports to Canada in order to avoid disruption of the Canadian market. Exports and Export Proceeds The surrender of the proceeds from exports is not required, and exchange receipts are freely disposable. For security reasons, there is export control on strategic goods to all destinations except the United States. All exports to Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic and East Berlin, Hungary, the Democratic People's Re- public of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and Viet Nam are subject to control, although certain goods of Canadian origin may be exported to these destinations under the authority of a general export permit. All exporters are eligible for certain financial 134 facilities operated by the Export Development Corpora- tion (EDC), including political risk insurance. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles No exchange control requirements are imposed on exchange payments for, or exchange receipts from, invisibles. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. Apart from specific restrictions in the financial, broad- casting, and uranium sectors, inward direct investment is governed by the Investment Canada Act. Under the provisions of this Act, new foreign investments are in general subject to notification requirements but not to review, and direct acquisition of businesses with assets exceeding Can$5 million and indirect acquisitions involv- ing assets exceeding Can$50 million are subject to review. In addition, acquisitions below these limits and invest- ments to establish new businesses in culturally sensitive sectors may be reviewed. Investments that are subject to review are required only to pass a test of yielding net benefit to Canada. There are no controls over outward direct investment, nor over inward or outward portfolio investment. Although higher ratios may be authorized on a case-by-case basis, in general the domestic assets of a foreign-owned bank operating in Canada must not exceed 20 times its authorized capital; the total domestic assets of all such banks must not exceed 16 percent of the total domestic assets of all banks operating in Canada.1 Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. However, exports of gold and all other products containing gold to countries named in the Area Control List require an export permit from the Minister of External Affairs, under the authority of the Export and Import Permits Act. Gold of U.S. origin requires a permit when re-exported to all countries except the United States. Commercial imports of articles con- taining minor quantities of gold, such as watches, are unrestricted and free of license. Legal tender gold coins with a face value of Can$100 have been issued annually since 1976, and Can$50 "bullion" coins, containing one ounce of gold, have also been issued since 1979. Beginning in 1982, Can$10 and Can$5 coins containing !/4 and V\o ounce of gold, respectively, have also been issued; since 1986, a half-ounce coin with a face value of Can$50 has been issued. 1 Under the proposed U.S.-Canada free trade agreement, regulations concerning acquisitions subject to review, and restrictions with respect to market shares and asset growth of U.S. bank subsidiaries, will be liberalized. ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution CAPE VERDE (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Cape Verde is the Cape Verde Escudo, which is pegged to a weighted basket of currencies representing nine important trading partners. The ex- change rate of the Cape Verde escudo in terms of the U.S. dollar, the in terven t ion currency, is fixed daily on the basis of quotations for the U.S. dollar and the other currencies included in the basket. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were C .V. Esc 65.47 and C .V. Esc 66.08, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control All foreign exchange transactions are under the control of the Directorate of Foreign Relations and Exchange Control (DRECC), which is a department of the Bank of Cape Verde (the central bank). All imports, exports, and re-exports are subject to licensing, except for transactions not exceeding C.V. Esc 10,000. Foreign exchange trans- actions, including the surrender of foreign exchange proceeds, are effected through the central bank. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency The central bank determines the currency in which export proceeds should be repatriated. Cape Verde has bilateral payments agreements w i th Angola and Sao Tome and Principe. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may open demand deposit accounts in local currency. These accounts may be credited only w i th the proceeds from the sale or surrender of receipts of convertible currencies and may be debited for payment of any obligations in Cape Verde. Outward transfers of balances from such accounts may be made freely. Em- bassies and foreign officials of embassies are required to open special accounts in foreign currency and in local currency; such accounts must be replenished exclusively with foreign exchange. Special Accounts (Emigrants) Three types of special interest-bearing deposit accounts are available for emigrants: (1) foreign exchange deposit accounts; (2) savings-credit deposit accounts; and (3) special accounts in Cape Verde escudos. These accounts can only be credited with convertible foreign currencies. Holders of savings-credit deposit accounts can benefit from loans on special terms for financing small-scale projects. Imports and Import Payments All imports are subject to licensing, except for trans- actions not exceeding C.V. Esc 10,000. Licenses, which are issued by the General Directorate of Commerce in the Ministry of Transportation, Trade and Tourism, re- quire the visa of the central bank and are generally valid for 90 days; they are renewable. The provision of foreign exchange is guaranteed when the license has been pre- viously certified by the central bank. Licenses are in general granted liberally for imports of medicines, capital goods, and other development-related equipment. Imports of nonessentials are restricted. Payments for Invisibles All paymen ts for invisibles require prior authorization. Any person traveling abroad may take out foreign cur- rency equivalent to C.V. Esc 20,000. Cape Verdean nationals traveling abroad as tourists are required to buy round-trip tickets in advance and make a deposit equiv- alent to a one-way ticket to the country of destination; this deposit is refunded upon return to Cape Verde. Cape Verdean nationals studying abroad are allowed up to a maximum of C.V. Esc 20,000 on leaving the country; students who do not hold scholarships are, in addition, entitled to a monthly allowance that varies according to the country of destination. Persons traveling abroad on business may take an amount of foreign currency that varies in accordance to the country of destination and the duration of each business trip. Persons traveling abroad for medical treatment may take out an amount of foreign currency that varies in accordance with medical needs. Applications for these allowances must be accom- panied by medical certification prior to the trip, and medical bills must be presented on return to Cape Verde. Transfers by foreign technical assistance personnel working in Cape Verde are authorized within the limits specified in the individual contracts. These contracts, as well as other contracts involving foreign exchange ex- penditures, are subject to prior screening by the central bank. Requests by other foreigners are examined on a case-by-case basis. The export of domestic currency by travelers is prohibited. Foreign travelers may bring in any amount of foreign currency, but may re-export only up to the amount of currency declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports are subject to licensing and to approval by the central bank, except for transactions not exceeding C.V. Esc 10,000. Export proceeds must be repatriated within three months from the date-of issuance of the license, but this period may be extended. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the central bank. The import of Cape Verdean bank notes is prohibited. 137 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CAPE VERDE Capital Any private capital transaction must be approved in advance by the central bank, but legally imported capital may be re-exported without limitation. The export of resident-owned capital is not normally permitted.

Not for Redistribution CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Central African Republic is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transactions in French francs between the BEAC and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1, free of commission. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rates for the currencies concerned in the Paris exchange market. A commission of 0.25 percent is levied on all capital transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except those made for the account of the Treasury and for the expenses of students. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, the exchange control measures of the Central African Re- public do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Bur- kina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control All draft legislation, directives, correspondence, and contracts having a direct or indirect bearing on the finances of the State require the prior approval of the Minister of Finance, who has delegated his approval authority to the Director of the Budget. The Autonomous Amortization Fund (CAADE) in the Ministry of Finance supervises borrowing abroad, and the Office of Foreign Financial Relations in the same ministry supervises lending abroad, issuing, advertising, or offering for sale foreign securities in the Central African Republic, and inward and outward direct inves tmen t. Exchange control is administered by the Minister of Finance, who has delegated some of his approval authority to the BEAC ,2 to the authorized banks, and to the Postal Administration. All exchange transac- tions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks. Export declarations are to be made through the Directorate of Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Commerce and Indus try, except those for gold, which are to be made through the BEAC. Arrears are maintained with respect to external paymen ts. 1 The CFA franc circulating in the Central African Repub l ic is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, Chad, the Congo, Equatorial Gu inea, and Gabon. 2 The au thor i ty delegated to the BEAC relates to (1) control over the external position of the banks, (2) the granting of exceptional travel allocations in excess of the basic allowances, and (3) control over the repatriation of net export proceeds. Prescription of Currency Since the Central African Republic is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The principal nonres- ident accounts are Foreign Accounts in Francs. BEAC bank notes received by the foreign correspondents of authorized banks and mailed to the BEAC agency in Bangui by the Bank of France or the Banque Centrale des Etats de I'Afrique de TOuest (BCEAO) may be credited freely to Foreign Accounts in Francs. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are suspended. Imports from all other countries are not subject to licensing requirements or to quotas. Imports of firearms are pro- hibited irrespective of origin. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. The import license entitles importers to purchase the necessary exchange, provided that the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are per- mitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. For many types of payment the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Pay- ments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income ac- cruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. Residents traveling as tourists to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 50,000 a year for each person; of this allocation, an amount equivalent to CFAF 25,000 may be taken out in foreign bank notes. Any exchange in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 5,000 that remains after return to the Central African Republic must be surrendered. For business travel to foreign countries, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 10,000 a person a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 139 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC 100,000 a trip, for travel to certain listed countries; the allocation for business travel to any other foreign country is CFAF 15,000 a day, up to CFAF 150,000 a trip; of th is allocation, an amount equivalent to CFAF 5,000 may be taken out in foreign bank notes. The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreigner working in the Central African Republic is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three mon ths of the pay period. Travelers to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 10,000 in BEAC bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes issued by any other institute of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Travelers to other countries may take out any amount in BEAC bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign currency and other foreign means of payment up to the amount declared by them on en t ry; they may reconvert up to CFAF 50,000 in BEAC bank notes into foreign currency. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are suspended. All exports require a declaration. Proceeds from exports to foreign countries must be collected and repatriated within one month from the due date; the latter must not be later than 90 days after the arrival of the goods at their destination, unless special authorization is obtained. Ex- port proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or an Operations Account country must be sur- rendered. Ail export transactions must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected within a month of the due date and, if received in foreign currency, surrendered within a month of the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Capital Capital movements between the Central African Re- public and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange con- trol; capital transfers to all other countries require ex- change control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. All foreign borrowing by the Government or its public and semipublic enterprises, as well as all foreign borrowing with a government guarantee, requires the prior approval of the Director of the Budget. 140 Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct inves tmen t, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in the Central African Republic; these controls relate to the transactions them- selves, not to paymen ts or receipts. With the exception of those controls over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in the Central African Republic, the measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. Direct inves tmen ts abroad3 require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from re inves tment of undis- tributed prof i ts; the fu ll or partial liquidation of such inves tmen ts also requires the prior approval of the Min- istry of Finance unless the operation involves the relin- quishing of a participation that had previously been approved as cons t i tu t ing a direct inves tment abroad. Foreign direct investments in the Central African Republic4 must be declared to the Minister of Finance, unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from rein- ves tment of und is tr ibu ted profits; the Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request postponement. The full or partial liquidation of direct inves tmen ts in the Central African Republic must also be declared to the Minister, unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct inves tment in the Central African Republic. Both the making and the liquidation of direct inves tmen ts, whe ther these are Central African Republic inves tmen ts abroad or foreign inves tmen ts in the Central African Republic, must be reported to the Minister w i th in 20 days following each operation. Direct inves tmen ts are defined as invest- ments implying control of a company or an enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct inve s tmen t, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in the Central African Republic requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Governmen t, and (2) shares similar to securities whose issuing, adver- tising, or offering for sale in the Central African Republic has previously been authorized.

Lending abroad by physical or juridical persons, whose normal residence or registered office is in the Central African Republic, or by branches or subsidiaries in the Central African Republic of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans granted by registered banks, and (2) other loans when the total amount outstanding of the loans does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one lender. The making of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be reported to the Office of Foreign Financial Relations within 20 days of the operation, except when the amount of the loan granted abroad by the lender is less than CFAF 500,000. Under Law No. 62/355 of February 19, 1963 (as amended by Ordinance No. 69/47 of September 2, 1969) and UDEAC Decision No. 18/65 of December 14, 1965, industrial, tourist, agricultural, and mining enterprises (both foreign and domestic) established in the Central African Republic are granted, under certain conditions, a reduction in duties and taxes on the import of specified CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC equ ipmen t; in addition, certain enterprises receive ex- emption from direct taxes on specified income. The law also provides for three categories of preferential trea tment (A, B, and C), in accordance with which fiscal and other privileges may be accorded to firms investing in new enterprises or in the expansion of existing ones . most sectors of the economy, except the commercial sector. Requests for approval for preferential trea tment must be submitted to the Minister of Indu s t ry, who is the Chairman of the Inves tment Commission, which considers the application. If a positive decision is given by the Commission, the proposed authorization is submitted to the Council of Ministers. Preferential trea tmen ts A and C are granted by decree issued by the Council of Ministers. Preferential trea tment B is granted by an Act of the Board of Directors of the former Equatorial Customs Union upon the recommendation of the Council of Ministers. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in the Central African Republic. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require a license, which is seldom granted; in practice, imports and exports are made by an authorized purchasing office. Exempt from prior authorization are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quan t i ty of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Certain companies have been offi- cially appointed as Offices for the Purchase, Import, and Export of Gold and Raw Diamonds. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments January 1.

Not for Redistribution CHAD (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Chad is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transactions in French francs between the BEAC and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rates for the currencies concerned in the Paris exchange market. A commission of 0.25 percent is levied on all capital transfers abroad, except those made for the account of the Treasury and for the expenses of students. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, Chad's exchange control measures do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Mon- aco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Ac- count (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Comoros, Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. How- ever, they must be declared and be made only through authorized banks and with bank checks. All other coun- tries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control The Office of the Minister of Finance supervises bor- rowing and lending abroad, the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Chad, and inward and outward direct investment; it also issues import and export authorizations for gold. Exchange control is ad- ministered by the Minister of Finance, who has delegated his approval authority in part to the External Finance and Exchange Control Department, which exercises this authority through instructions issued in the authorized intermediaries. All exchange transactions relating to for- eign countries must be effected through authorized banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Foreign Trade Office in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Since Chad is an Operations Account country, settle- ments with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in 1 The CFA franc circulating in Chad is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. 142 any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BEAC bank notes may be credited freely to Foreign Accounts in Francs main- tained by the foreign correspondent of an authorized bank, provided that the notes are mailed to the BEAC agency in Chad by the correspondent bank concerned. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa and the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya are prohibited. Imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar from all sources require licenses. All other imports from countries in the French Franc Area and from European Communities (EC) countries (the original member states), other than France, may be made freely. All imports from non-EC countries outside the French Franc Area are subject to licensing in accord- ance with an annual import program. This program and the amount of foreign exchange required to implement it are determined by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry on the basis of proposals drawn up by the Committee on Imports. The import program contains global quotas for imports from non-EC countries outside the French Franc Area and a special quota for imports of cotton textiles from countries with abnormal competitive advantages. In ad- dition, the program contains global quotas for imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar from EC countries, coun- tries in the French Franc Area, as well as other countries. Specified imports from certain neighboring countries not belonging to the French Franc Area up to a value of CFAF 3 million a year in each direction for a single importer may be made through compensation transac- tions. The issuance of import licenses for sugar and a specified brand of cigarettes has been suspended until further notice. All import transactions valued at CFAF 100,000 or more and relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Import licenses entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, provided that the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank. Forward cover for imports from foreign countries is permitted only for specified commodities and requires the prior approval of the Office of the Minister of Economy and Commerce. There has been some accumulation of arrears on external paymen ts, owing to the imposition of statutory ceilings on central bank credit to the Govern- ment and an ensuing shortage of domestic currency with which to purchase foreign exchange. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are per- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution mitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. For many types of payment, the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Pay- ments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income ac- cruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when bona fide. Some current payments, however, may be subject to delay. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Oper- ations Account countries may obtain an exchange allo- cation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a person a trip, for any number of trips a year. This allocation is increased by the equivalent of CFAF 50,000 for each child under 10 years of age. For pilgrimage to Mecca, an additional allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 200,000 may be granted. For business travel to foreign countries, there is a daily allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 60,000, with a maximum allocation of the equiv- alent of up to CFAF 500,000 a person a trip; the External Finance and Exchange Control Department may approve additional amounts. Travelers to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 30,000 in BEAC bank notes; the limit for children under 10 years of age is CFAF 5,000. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign bank notes and coin up to the amount declared by them on entry, in addition to amounts remitted from foreign bank accounts. If no declaration has been made, they may take out up to the equivalent of CFAF 150,000, in addition to a maximum of CFAF 30,000 in BEAC bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa and the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya are prohibited. All exports to non-EC countries outside the French Franc Area require licenses. Specified exports to certain neighboring countries, including Nigeria and Sudan, may be made through compensation transactions. Exports of cotton are the monopoly of the Soci6te Cotonniere du Tchad (COTONTCHAD). Export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 50,000. Export proceeds received in cur- rencies other than those of France or an Operations Account country must be surrendered. Export proceeds normally must be received within 180 days after the arrival of the commodities at their destination. The proceeds must be collected, and be surrendered if received in a foreign currency, within one month of the due date. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be CHAD collected and, if received in foreign currency, be surren- dered within two months of the due date. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) and other foreign means of payment. Foreign bank notes and coin in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 brought in by residents must be exchanged for CFA francs within eight days of their return. Capital Capital movements between Chad and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. All foreign securities, foreign cur- rency, and titles embodying claims on foreign countries or nonresidents that are held in Chad by residents or nonresidents must be deposited with authorized banks in Chad. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable or suspended insofar as they would be contrary to the exchange control regulations) are maintained over borrowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Chad; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the excep- tion of those controls over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in Chad, the measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. Direct investments abroad2 require the prior approval of the Minister of Finance, irrespective of the method of financing; the full or partial liquidation of such investments also requires the prior approval of the Minister. Foreign direct investments in Chad3 require the prior approval of the Minister of Finance unless they take the form of a mixed-economy enterprise. The full or partial liquidation of direct investments in Chad must also be declared to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Chadian investments abroad or foreign investments in Chad, must be reported to the Minister within 30 days of each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Chad requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, how- ever, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed 2 Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Chad and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Chad. 3 Including those made by companies in Chad that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Chad of foreign companies. 143 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CHAD by a guarantee from the Chadian Government, and (2) shares similar to securities whose issue, advertising, or offering for sale in Chad has previously been authorized. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal resi- dence or registered office is in Chad, or by branches or subsidiaries in Chad of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been obtained, as indicated above; (2) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commer- cial transactions either between Chad and countries abroad or between foreign countries in which these persons or firms take part; and (3) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of the loan does not exceed CFAF 10 million for any one borrower, with an interest rate not higher than 7 percent and a maturity of two years or less. The contracting of loans referred to under (3) that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be declared to the Minister within 30 days of the operation. Lending abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal residence or registered office is in Chad, or by branches or subsidiaries in Chad of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans directly connected with the ren- dering of services abroad by the persons or firms men- tioned above, or with the financing of commercial trans- actions either between Chad and countries abroad or between foreign countries in which these persons or firms take part; and (2) other loans, when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed CFAF 5 mil- lion for any one lender. The making of loans referred to under (2) that are free of authorization, and each repay- ment thereon, must be declared to the Minister within 30 days of the operation. Commercial banks must maintain in Chad a specified minimum proportion of their assets. Under the Investment Code of August 26, 1963, any enterprise established in Chad, whether domestic or foreign, is granted, under certain conditions, reduced duties and taxes on specified imports, as well as exemption from direct taxes on specified income. The Code also provides for three categories of preferential treatment, in accordance with which certain fiscal and other privileges may be accorded to firms investing in specified new industries or in the expansion of existing ones. Requests for preferential treatment must be submitted to the Min- ister of Finance who, after examining the documents, transmits them to the Inves tment Commission. After an opinion has been given by that Commission, the project is submitted to the Council of Ministers. Gold Chad has issued gold coins with face values of CFAF 1,000, CFAF 3,000, CFAF 5,000, CFAF 10,000, and CFAF 20,000, which are legal tender. Residents who are not producers of gold may not hold unworked gold unless specifically authorized. Imports and exports of gold, whether unworked or refined, require prior author- ization by the Ministry of Finance and by the Directorate of Energy, Mines, and Geology, as well as the visa of the External Finance Department. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Exports of unworked gold and of raw diamonds (as well as domestic purchases and sales of both) are the monopoly of the Office for Purchases, Sales, Imports, and Exports (BAVIE), which is an approved private company. Un- worked gold may be exported only to France. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments January I. With the re-entry of Chad into the Central African Customs and Economic Union (UDEA), import taxes and tariffs began to be adjusted to conform to UDEA rates. As a result, between 1987 and 1990, 80 percent of all tariffs would be reduced and 20 percent would be increased. Changes will take place on Janu- ary 1 of each year. 144 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CHILE (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Chile is the Chilean Peso (Ch$). The off ic ial exchange rate of the Chilean peso is pegged to the U.S. dollar, at a rate adjusted at daily intervals according to a schedule established on the basis of the domestic rate of inflation during the previous mon th, less the estimated world rate of inflation. On December 31, 1987 the official exchange rate was Ch$234.05 per US$1. Foreign exchange dealers, the Banco del Estado, com- mercial banks, exchange houses, and other authorized entities are free to trade in foreign exchange at any price. However, the Central Bank intervenes in the foreign exchange market when the upper or lower limit (± 2 percent on either side of the official rate) is reached.' Since January 1, 1986, commercial banks have been authorized to provide a forward market for foreign ex- change with a ma tur i ty of between 15 and 180 days. On maturity, contracts are settled in pesos on the basis of the difference between the market rate and the contract rate. Contract rates are determined freely without inter- vention by the Central Bank. The regulations impose limits on banks' gross forward purchases and on their net exposure both overall and in individual currencies. The Central Bank provides forward cover against exchange risk in the form of currency swaps. The maturity periods of forward transactions range from 5 days to 360 days.2 Direct transactions in foreign exchange among private parties can take place at freely negotiated exchange rates, provided that they are occasional and unpublicized. Com- missions on exchange transactions are subject to a 20 percent value-added tax. The exchange rates of the Chilean peso with other currencies are determined on the basis of the peso exchange rate with respect to the U.S. dollar and of the U.S. dollar exchange rate with respect to other currencies quoted in foreign markets. The Central Bank has applied an exchange subsidy on service paymen ts on some debts contracted prior to August 6,1982. The following have access to the remaining subsidy: (1) debtors to Chilean banks or financial com- panies whose debt is indexed to the official exchange rate; and (2) debtors w i th direct obligations abroad whose obligations were registered with the Central Bank. The subsidy is paid by means of notes indexed to inflation with a maturity of six years, and carrying a 3 percent rate of interest. On December 31, 1987 the difference between the official rate and the subsidized rate was Ch$72.69 per US$1. Administration of Control The Executive Committee of the Central Bank is responsible for carrying out currency exchange policy. The Chilean Copper Commission is responsible for the 1 In terven t ion margins were widened to ± 3 percent on January 4,1988. 2 The max imum period was extended to 720 days in April 1988. supervision of copper exports and all imports of the copper indus try; this supervision has to be exercised in accordance with general rules enacted by the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency Settlements with Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Vene- zuela must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Bank of Chile and the central banks of each of the countries concerned, within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Settlements with the Dominican Republic must be made through clearing accounts established under a reciprocal credit agreement. Settlements with other countries take place in specified convertible currencies. Imports and Import Payments Most imports are free, with the exception of used motor vehicles. Most imports require a document (known as Informe de Importation) issued by the Central Bank, which can be obtained and processed through the inter- mediary local commercial bank. Payment for visible trade transactions is not permitted unless an Informe de Im- portation has been issued. Since March 23, 1983, imports are subject to a 120-day m in imum financing requirement. Importers may purchase spot exchange before the payment date and place a deposit in foreign exchange at the Central Bank in anticipation of payment. Imports on deferred payment terms (cober- tura diferida) —that is, on credit terms exceeding 360 days —require prior authorization of the credit terms by the Central Bank. Virtually all imports are subject to a registration tax of up to 3 percent of value, which is offset against the applicable import du ty. Since June 29, 1985, imports are subject to a uniform 20 percent tariff rate, with some exceptions.3 Exceptions include tariffs bound under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and tariffs negotiated with LAI A countries. A few items are exempted from the general tariff regime. Imports of some dairy products, such as condensed and powdered milk, butter, and cheese, are subject to specific duties and to a customs valuation regime based on European Communities (EC) internal prices for these products. Since May 2, 1984, imports of wheat, edible oil, and sugar have been subject to a special regime involving price bands within which the after-duty price has to remain. In addition, tariff duties or surcharges are applied, on a temporary basis, on imports of certain products that are subsidized in the country of origin. 3 The uniform tariff rate was lowered to 15 percent on January 4, 1988. 145 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CHILE Payments for Invisibles Specified allowances exist for certain transactions; central bank authorization is required for others. The authorization is provided upon presentation of appropriate documentation. The established limit for tourist travel (in addition to the fares) is the equivalent of US$1,000 a trip for travel to Latin America and Caribbean countries and of US$3,000 a trip to other countries. For travel by land, 20 percent of the allowance is provided in the form of foreign exchange, and the rest, in money orders. Higher amounts for travel other than tourism may be authorized by the Central Bank of Chile, upon presentation of adequate justification. Residents may purchase up to US$200 a month for study abroad, subscriptions to magazines, books, and pension payments, subject to presentation of appropriate documents. Higher amounts may be authorized by the Central Bank of Chile, upon presentation of adequate justification. Insurance activities within the country are limited to Chilean companies or to authorized foreign companies. Exports and Export Proceeds All commodities may be freely exported. All foreign exchange proceeds from exports in excess of US$1,000 must be surrendered through commercial banks, which are required to advise the Director of Foreign Trade of the Central Bank immediately (the Chilean Copper Com- mission in the case of copper). Commercial banks are authorized to purchase all foreign exchange proceeds spot from exporters. Exporters are allowed to retain from 2 percent to 5 percent of export proceeds in a special Foreign Exchange Account, but the cumulative deposits in any such account during a 12-month period may not exceed US$500,000. Receipts from exports of CODELCO (the state copper mines) must be deposited in a special foreign currency account at the Central Bank. Export proceeds subject to surrender requirements must be repatriated within 90 days from the date of shipment and surrendered within 1014 days from the date of shipment; for specified goods, this period may be extended. As a means of expediting the operation of the drawback system in respect of small export values, exporters of eligible items (approximately 6 percent of the coun try's annual exports), whose average annual exports in 1983 and 1984 were less than or equal to US$2.5 million, have an option of taking a subsidy, in lieu of benefits under the existing import du ty drawback scheme; alternatively, such exporters may avail themselves of the provisions of Decree No. 409, under which they may draw back their payments of duties on imported inputs. At the end of December 1987, this subsidy was equal to 10 percent of the net export value of sales for those exporters whose annual export value was less than or equal to US$8.1 million and 5 percent for those exporters whose 4 The period was extended to 180 days in April 1988. 146 annual export value was between US$8.1 million and US$12.1 million. Proceeds from Invisibles In general, foreign exchange proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered only when required by a legal provision. Such is the case for commissions, proceeds from insurance, and other benefits related to foreign trade. There are no similar rules concerning the proceeds from royalties and copyright fees, family remittances, and the surplus foreign exchange from travel allocations. Capital Capital inflows are generally free, but most outflows are restricted. All new foreign borrowing or refinancing of existing credits by commercial banks requires prior approval by the Central Bank; the exceptions to this regulation are lines of credit of up to one-year maturity with foreign correspondents, and short-term loans for domestic relending. Short-term loans are subject to a limit determined mainly by a bank 's capital and reserves. However, the Central Bank must still be notified of foreign borrowings even if they do not require its approval. Foreign capital may enter Chile under one of the following arrangements, depending on the purpose and type of the inves tmen t. (1) Article 14 of Decree No. 471 of October 17, 1977 stipulates, inter alia, that capital brought into the country in the form of foreign borrowing (creditos externos) must be sold through authorized banks when the investor (individual or corporate, national or foreign) has registered the transaction with the Central Bank. There is no m in imum term on the ma tur i ty of foreign borrowing. Repatriation normally is allowed only in accordance with the amortization schedule established at the time of registration. Accelerated paymen ts or extensions of pay- ment are subject to special authorization. (2) Article 15 of the same decree authorizes the Central Bank to make exemptions to the general rules enacted by it concerning the inflow and outflow of capital or credits. (3) Decree-Law No. 600 of July 7, 1974 (amended by Decree-Law No. 1748 of March 18, 1977), the Foreign Investment Statute, establishes a regime for long-term capital inves tmen t. Authorization to make a foreign ex- change investment in Chile is granted by the Foreign Inves tment Committee through a contract containing undertakings that the inves tment program will normally not exceed eight years for mining and three years for other projects. Inves tmen ts of less than US$5 million may be approved by the Executive Secretary of the Committee, with a few exceptions. There are no general limitations on profit remittances, but specific agreements in this regard may be included in the above-mentioned inves tment contract. Capital may be repatriated after three years unless specified otherwise in the inves tment contract. Foreign investors can opt for a guaranteed 49.5 percent a year total corporation income tax over a period of ten years, or may subject themselves to a tax system ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution similar to that which is applied to domestic corporations. (According to this system, foreign investors are subject to an effective tax rate of 32.5 percent.) Any foreign credits involved must be on terms authorized by the Central Bank. Foreign capital that entered Chile prior to the promulgation of Decree-Law No. 600 and is not subject to that law continues to be subject to the regu- lations prevailing on the date of entry. Contract awards in the oil sector are decided by the Government under Presidential Decree; rights and responsibilities under such a Decree may be vested in the Empresa Nacional de Petroleo (ENAP) by the Ministry of Mines. (4) Chapters XVIII and XIX of the Chilean Compen- dium of Rules on International Exchange, introduced in May 1985 and amended several times since, regulate the purchase of selected Chilean foreign debt instruments abroad at a discount as well as their repatriation. Eligible instruments are defined as external debt payable in foreign currency outside Chile with a maturity of more than one year, the debtor of which may be either the Treasury, the Central Bank, a public sector entity, the Development Corporation (CORFO), a financial ins t i tu t ion, or a private sector resident having a guarantee from a financial insti- tution. Chapter XIX governs the use of Chilean debt instruments by foreign residents for direct investment in Chile with remittance rights. Upon approval of the Central Bank, the foreign currency obligation is exchanged into a domestic currency obligation, the proceeds of which must be used for direct investment purposes, with the intermediation of a financial institution; special regulations apply to repatriation of such capital as well as to dividend payments. Chapter XVIII specifies the regulations for the conversion into peso assets (without remittance rights) by residents and nonresidents of debt purchased at a discount abroad with foreign exchange not obtained in the official market and of private sector external debt not guaranteed by the Government. Transactions under Chap- ter XVIII are also channeled through financial institutions, subject to an overall quota assigned on the basis of an auction system. Gold Chile has issued three gold coins, which are not legal tender. Monetary gold may be traded only by authorized houses, but ordinary transactions in gold between private individuals may be freely undertaken. Imports and exports of gold are unrestricted, subject to compliance with the normal formalities for import and export transactions, including registration with the Central Bank. CHILE Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments February 17. The regulations governing imports from Free Zones (Zonas Francas) were modified. May 23. It was announced that with effect from June 1, preferential tariff treatment would be suspended for those countries that had not until that date adopted the new regional scheme of preferential tariffs (i.e., all countries other than Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Uruguay). August 5. A system of deferred payment was introduced for customs duties on imports of capital goods. Under the new system, du ty payments can be deferred for up to six years if the c.i.f. import value is US$5,000 or greater. Exports and Export Proceeds July 8. The list of goods eligible for export financing through rediscounts of the Central Bank was expanded. October 3. Law No. 18.653 changed the regulations governing export subsidies. The main changes, which took effect as from April 20, 1987, were the introduction of a subsidy equal to 5 percent for export values of between US$7.6 million and US$11.25 million and the indexation of these values, which are to be adjusted annually. December 17. Decree No. 361 of the Ministry of Economy changed the maximum values of exports subject to the subsidies of 10 percent and 5 percent, to US$8.1 million and US$12.1 million, respectively. Capital September 9. Law No. 18.645 established a fund which would guarantee loans granted to nontraditional exporters to cover their capital needs. September 16. The establishment of External Invest- ment Funds under Chapter XIX to facilitate the conver- sion of Chilean external debt was authorized. Under the new mechanism, small external investors are able to participate in debt equity conversions without having to go through the case-by-case conditions normally applied to such operations. September 29. Law No. 18.657 allowed the setting up of foreign capital investment funds. Proceeds from these funds may only be invested in Chilean domestic financial instruments with certain portfolio restrictions. Original capital may only be repatriated after five years, with no limit on profit remittances. 147 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the People's Republic of China is the Renminbi and its unit is the yuan. Since January 1, 1986 China formally has followed an exchange arrangement whereby the exchange rate for the renminbi is based on developments in the balance of payments and in costs and exchange rates of China's major competitors, al- though since July 5, 1986 the exchange rate for the renminbi has not changed against the U.S. dollar. The exchange rates for the U.S. dollar and 19 other currencies are published on a daily basis by the State Administration of Exchange Control;1 on December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were Y 3.7128 and Y 3.7314, respectively, per US$1. Published rates for currencies other than those that are important in China's international transactions are changed whenever the calculated rate diverges from the previously published rate by 0.5 percent or 1 percent. Since Novem- ber 1986 Chinese enterprises in the four economic zones of Shantou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, and Zhuhai, and foreign investment corporations have been permitted to transact foreign exchange at rates mutually agreed on between buyers and sellers under the supervision of the State Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC). A relatively small volume of transactions has taken place in these markets at rates which are depreciated relative to the official rates. In the principal market for these transactions (in the Shenzhen special economic zone), the exchange rate depreciated from Y 5.5 per US$1 to about Y 6 per US$1 during the first quarter of 1987, and subsequently stabilized at that level. On December 31, 1987 the exchange rate in this market was Y 5.9 per US$1. Forward exchange rates are published for 15 curren- cies.2 China does not apply a system of forward premiums and discounts but instead uses the spot rate plus a forward charge. Forward transactions are only permitted in con- nection with an underlying trade transaction. When banks sell renminbi forward, a charge is levied; when they buy, no charge is levied except for the deutsche mark, Neth- erlands guilder, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. Rates are given for one to six months; transactions can be renewed for a further six months, but not for longer than one year. Forward charges reflect interest rates and trends in international markets in the currencies concerned. Administration of Control The People's Bank of China (PBC) exercises central bank functions and control over foreign exchange; and 1 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dol- lars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Iranian rials, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Pakistan rupees, pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 2 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 148 the SAEC, as a government institution under the lead- ership of the PBC, is responsible for implementing the exchange regulations and controlling all foreign exchange transactions in accordance with state policy. There are sub-bureaus in the provinces, main municipalities, auton- omous regions, and special economic zones. The Bank of China (BOC) is the specialized foreign exchange bank of the People's Republic of China. Other banks and financial institutions, including affiliates of nonresident banks, may handle designated transactions with the ap- proval of the SAEC. Currently, 90 institutions are au- thorized to handle foreign exchange transactions. The China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) is authorized to conduct transactions connected with investments of foreign capital in China. Individuals and financial institutions may hold foreign exchange but may not deal in it or conduct arbitrage operations. Special exchange control measures are applied to special eco- nomic zones, the 14 designated coastal cities, and border regions. Foreign exchange transactions are generally conducted in accordance with a foreign exchange plan. The PBC has responsibility for foreign exchange reserves and external borrowing. Within guidelines recommended to the State Council by the PBC on balance of payments management and total external borrowing, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (MOFERT) prepares estimates for those parts of the foreign exchange plan dealing with foreign trade, foreign loans, and China's external assistance program; the foreign exchange budgets of other government departments are prepared by the Ministry of Finance. The SAEC draws up the section of the plan covering local and provincial nontrade transac- tions, receipts from overseas Chinese, and individual receipts. The overall foreign exchange plan is coordinated and balanced by the State Planning Commission (SPC) and is submitted to the State Council for approval. Following approval, the plan is sent back to the various localities and ministries for implementation. The SAEC is responsible for supervising the implementation of the foreign exchange plan. In principle, the foreign exchange plan covers all transactions, including those with countries with which China maintains bilateral payments agreements.3 The annual plan is divided into quarterly plans, and at the end of each quarter, the SAEC and SPC review the imple- mentation of the plan and determine whether corrections are necessary. That part of the foreign exchange plan dealing with trade is broken down by commodity.

It also maintains operative bilateral paymen ts agreements with Albania, Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Repub l ic, the Democratic People's Repub l ic of Korea, Mongolia, and the U.S.S.R. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution expected events, such as changes in foreign trade policies, might necessitate a revision of the plan. Prescription of Currency Trade transactions with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, and the U.S.S.R. are expressed in Swiss francs, and those with Albania and Cuba, in U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate and settled through bilateral payments arrangements. In normal circumstances, imbalances emerging toward the end of each year are covered by increased deliveries of goods. Noncommercial transac- tions are settled on a current basis in convertible curren- cies, except for part of such transactions with the Dem- ocratic People's Republic of Korea and Romania and all the transactions with Cuba, which pass through the clearing account. Payments to and from countries with which China has bilateral payments agreements are made in currencies and in accordance with the procedures set forth in those agreements. In other cases, where there are no specific regulations prescribing the currencies to be used in transactions, they are determined by terms agreed under the respective contracts. Bilateral trade and payments agreements are of two kinds: Type A agreements are designed to ensure balanced trade and include, for each good itemized, quantitative commodity lists or foreign exchange quota lists for those commodities that cannot be expressed in quantitative terms; these lists are binding on both parties. Most arrangements are of this type. Type B agreements (those with the Islamic Republic of Iran and Sierra Leone) provide such binding itemized lists only for the principal goods traded by the parties and also include nonbinding lists of secondary goods. Nonresident and Foreign Currency Accounts Nonresidents4 in China for a short period may open nonresident accounts with the BOC and other authorized banks and financial institutions. Joint ventures may also open foreign exchange accounts and use them to make payments abroad. Foreign banks may hold convertible renminbi accounts in connection with commercial or noncommercial transactions. Renminbi may be purchased for such an account only on presentation of documentary evidence that the money will be used in the designated transaction. The BOC and other authorized banks and financial institutions may check any use made of renminbi in such accounts. Foreign banks in the special economic zones may lend in foreign exchange and accept foreign currency deposits from joint venture companies. Individuals may open resident foreign currency ac- counts at the BOC and may withdraw funds from such accounts in the form of foreign curency. 4 Nonresidents include overseas Chinese and residents of foreign coun- tries and of the Hong Kong and Macao regions. Foreign embassies are also included. PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA Imports and Exports All trade, both direct and indirect, with the Republic of Korea and South Africa is prohibited. The primary responsibility for formulating foreign trade policies and ensuring the implementation of regulations and policy measures rests with MOFERT, which also issues the licenses required for restricted imports and a large number of exports;5 following the reform in the exchange and trade system effected in early 1985, MOFERT no longer engages in direct foreign trade transactions and is no longer involved in the daily enter- prise management of trading corporations. Foreign trade is conducted by national foreign trade corporations and other entities licensed by MOFERT to conduct foreign trade; in addition, certain manufacturing companies are permitted to engage directly in foreign trade, and some companies conduct foreign trade as agents on a commis- sion basis. Exporters and importers can freely choose their agents; however, a limited number of essential import commodities continue to be handled by one of the 14 national foreign trade corporations. All enterprises, other than registered national foreign trade corporations, need approval from the local foreign trade bureau in accordance with the authorization of MOFERT and a license from the local bureau for industry and commerce to engage in foreign trade. Proceeds of certain exports (joint-venture companies and 100 percent foreign-owned companies) may be retained in a foreign exchange account with the BOC or an authorized bank. All other foreign exchange earnings from exports must be repatriated and surrendered to the BOC, unless specific exception is granted by the SAEC, and may not be used directly to offset import payments. Part of the proceeds of exports (including foreign exchange earned in com- pensation trade) may be held as foreign exchange retention quotas6 in the SAEC or its sub-bureaus by localities and enterprises in accordance with state regulations. The percentage of export earnings that can be retained varies with the enterprise. Before using their holdings of foreign exchange or foreign exchange retention quotas, enter- prises other than the national foreign trade corporations must seek the approval of the SAEC. The BOC provides foreign exchange for imports on the basis of import licenses and approval by the SAEC. Residents may not pay for imports with local currency. Imports consist of those included in the Annual Import Plan and those outside of the annual plan. The foreign trade plan is drawn up by MOFERT in conjunction with the SPC. The former sends directives on the preparation of the plan to all foreign trade corporations and to the foreign trade bureaus in the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, which, in turn, meet with other interested entities and prepare lists of needed imports 5 MOFERT itself issues licenses for some restricted imports into Beijing; for the rest, it delegates its authority to its special commission offices at major ports and to its regional counterparts —commissions on foreign economic relations and trade (COFERT). 6 A retention quota constitutes a right to purchase foreign exchange in the fu tu re for renminbi. 149 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA and goods available for export. The plans prepared at the local level are coordinated and balanced by MOFERT and the SPC at national foreign trade planning confer- ences. The State Council grants final approval to the foreign trade plan. Goods that can be produced domestically or for which adequate domestic substitutes are available are not in- cluded in the import plan. Priority is given in the import plan to goods that cannot be produced domestically in adequate quantities and those that are urgently needed by the State, especially for key projects. In the case of some goods that are not produced in adequate quantities but for which a good foreign market exists, part of the production may be allocated to export. Imports into China are also classified into two other categories—restricted imports and unrestricted imports.7 A number of restricted imports overlap with those in- cluded in the annual import plan.8 Import licensing serves to limit, and in some cases, prohibit imports of restricted goods that are included in the annual plan. Imports of seven assembly lines on the restricted list (for television sets, household refrigerators, household washing ma- chines, radio-cassette recorders, room air conditioners, motorcycles, and light motor vehicles) are effectively banned through the licensing system; import of these lines requires approval by the State Economic Commis- sion, which currently does not grant approval. Apart from imports that are restricted through the licensing system, a few types of imports are explicitly banned, such as all second-hand garments. Imports of poisons, narcotic drugs, diseased animals, and plants are prohibited, as is the export of valuable cultural relics and rare books, rare animals, seeds and plants, and precious metals and artifacts made from these metals. In addition, the import and export of weapons, ammunition and explosives, radio receivers and trans- mitters, Chinese currency, manuscripts, printed and re- corded materials, and films that are deemed to be detri- mental to Chinese political, economic, cultural, and moral interests are prohibited. All imports and exports require prior inspection before release by customs at the port of entry or exit. Exports of specified machine tools require a license from the State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities, as a means of quality control. The customs regulations in force are the Provisional Customs Law of the People's Republic of China and the Customs Import and Export Tariff of the People's Re- public of China. The tariff rates for imports fall into two categories: minimum and general. The m in imum tariff rates apply to imports originating in the countries with which China has concluded trade treaties or agreements with reciprocal favorable tariff clauses therein;9 the gen- 7 As of October 1987, there were 46 goods on the restricted list, including 23 kinds of assembly lines counted as one item. 8 In principle, the restricted list can change on a mon th ly basis. The coverage of the import plan also changes. Therefore, the degree of overlap changes over time. 9 These countries are as follows (classified by geographical areas): 150 eral tariff rates apply to imports originating in the countries with which China has not concluded trade treaties or agreements with reciprocal favorable tariff clauses. The duties are calculated on the basis of the c.i.f. value of imported goods. Excluding goods that are exempt from duties, goods in the general tariff rate category are subject to 17 rates ranging from 8 percent to 180 percent, and goods in the m in imum tariff rate category are subject to 17 rates ranging from 3 percent to 150 percent. In addition to the import duties mentioned above, a regulatory tax on imports is applied to 15 selected products; the regu- latory tax rates range from 20 percent to 80 percent. Imports into Tibet through border trade with the neigh- boring countries are subject to a separate system of customs duties established by the People's Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region. The tariff, however, applies to goods imported directly into Tibet for use only. It does not apply to imports of other provinces, munici- palities, and autonomous regions through Tibet, or to imports through Tibet by mail or brought in as part of the luggage carried by travelers; such imports are subject to the regular Chinese tariff. In addition to customs duties, a consolidated industrial and commercial tax (a turnover tax also applied to other commodities) is levied on imports in accordance with the list contained in the Draft Regulations of the Consolidated Industrial and Commercial Tax of the People's Republic of China. Raw materials imported for further processing are exempted from both customs duties and commercial taxes, provided that the products are all exported within a specified period. Most imports and exports by joint ventures are exempt from customs duties. Special economic zones have been set up in Shantou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, and Zhuhai. Economic and technol- ogy development areas have been established in 14 designated coastal cities. Foreigners, overseas Chinese, and Chinese from the Hong Kong and Macao regions are permitted to invest in and open factories in these zones and areas. Raw materials, equipment and machinery or parts and components thereof, means of transportation, and other means of production imported by and intended to be used in the production of the enterprises in the zones are exempt from import duties and the consolidated industrial and commercial tax.

Not for Redistribution Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Enterprises must sell their foreign exchange earnings from invisible transactions to the BOC and other autho- rized banks, except for enterprises with foreign invest- ment and some foreign trade sectors designated as an experiment area for trade reforms. Foreign exchange remitted from abroad or from the Hong Kong and Macao regions to Chinese residents may be retained and used to open an account in the BOC or an authorized bank. Similarly, foreign exchange owned by immigrants or returning Chinese before becoming residents may be retained. Such retained foreign exchange may be sold to or remitted through the BOC, or taken out of China against certification by the BOC. All foreign exchange earned by Chinese residents when working abroad, or in the Hong Kong or Macao regions, or earned from publication fees, copyright fees, awards, subsidies, honoraria, or other premiums must be repa- triated and may not be deposited abroad; but individuals may retain such earnings according to prevailing regula- tions. All the surrendered portion of foreign exchange remittances is accorded the privileged treatment given to remittances by overseas Chinese. Foreign staff members and employees of foreign joint ventures, as well as those from the Hong Kong and Macao regions,10 may remit their salaries and other income earned in China, after payment of taxes and deduction of their living expenses in China and approval by the relevant local authorities. Profits of joint ventures may be remitted after taxation, in accordance with foreign exchange reg- ulations; such remittances are subject to the approval of the local branch of the SAEC and should be paid through the foreign exchange account of the joint venture. Re- mitted profits are subject to an additional tax of 10 percent, but only if the profits have been generated in areas other than the special economic zones and the economic and technological development areas in the 14 selected coastal cities. If a Chinese resident wishes to spend money on travel abroad, receive his pension abroad, or remit money abroad, he must apply to the local SAEC bureau for approval. Such factors as the individual's normal income and expenditure are examined to determine if approval is to be granted for remittances. In cases of serious illness, death, or injury affecting a Chinese resident's parents, spouse, or children outside China, he may apply for foreign exchange up to a specified limit on presentation of documentary verification. If permission is granted to travel abroad, a Chinese resident is normally allowed to take a reasonable amount of foreign exchange to cover expenses for transport and subsistence; any surplus must be repatriated and surrendered to the BOC. There is no tax on travel. A Chinese resident who retires and emi- grates is normally permitted to receive his pension abroad, but he is not normally permitted to remit the proceeds from any assets he may sell in China. 10 Including those employed by enterprises with overseas and foreign Chinese capital. PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA Foreign exchange remitted or brought in by nonresi- dents may be converted into either renminbi or foreign exchange certificates denominated in renminbi. Foreign exchange certificates can be used by nonresidents in hotels, restaurants, and shops serving nonresidents, for purchasing airline tickets and train or ship fares to Hong Kong and Macao, and for international telecommunica- tions and parcel post charges. Special regulations apply in Guangdong province. Persons entering China must declare their holdings of foreign currency and may take out of China any unused foreign currency on presentation of the import declaration form issued by the customs. The import and export of Chinese bank notes are prohib- ited. Foreign exchange certificates may be imported, but their export is subject to the provision of documentation showing that they have been acquired legitimately. Chinese residents must show their authorization to export foreign currency at the border. Income from royalties, dividends, interest, and rentals earned by foreign businesses without establishments in China is subject to a 20 percent withholding tax; a preferential rate of 10 percent is applied for foreign and overseas Chinese partners in joint ventures set up in the special economic zones and the economic and technolog- ical development areas in the old urban areas of the 14 coastal cities. Joint ventures are required to be insured with Chinese insurance companies. Capital Foreign borrowing is classified either as "plan" or "nonplan" borrowing.11 Plan borrowing includes borrow- ing by the Central Government (through the PBC, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Forestry, and MOFERT and enterprises under the control of MOFERT) from international orga- nizations and bilateral sources; borrowing by CITIC and other investment and trust companies (ITICS) (mostly in the form of bond issues and bond borrowing abroad) to finance plan projects; borrowing by the BOC from foreign commercial banks to finance plan projects; and borrowing by provincial governments (either directly or through the BOC) for large projects included in provincial govern- ments' annual plans. Nonplan borrowing includes bor- rowing by the BOC for purposes other than projects included in the annual plan (this includes interbank loans and foreign exchange deposits held in BOC headquarters and abroad), foreign exchange deposit taking by other financial institutions, short-term trade credits, borrowing by joint-venture companies and 100 percent foreign- owned companies, all borrowing at the provincial level 11 The SAEC is the sole agency for monitoring and controlling China's external borrowing. The SAEC permits the BOC and other financial and nonfinancial institutions responsible for undertaking commercial borrow- ing to borrow up to specified limits without prior approval. All bond issues, however, are subject to prior approval by the SAEC. In August 1987, comprehensive regulations were issued requiring all foreign borrow- ing to be registered with the SAEC. Borrowers who do not comply will not be permitted to transfer foreign exchange abroad to meet their debt service obligations and will be subject to other penalties. 151 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA to finance small projects, lease financing, and borrowing from offshore Chinese enterprises (mainly in Hong Kong). The total amount of external borrowing for a specified future period and its split between concessional and nonconcessional sources is approved by the SPC. Within these limits, the SPC coordinates foreign borrowing for projects included in the annual and five-year plans. Under this procedure, the project-executing agencies (the Min- istry of Finance, MOFERT, foreign trade corporations, and provincial governments) propose projects to the SPC. Proposals indicate the total amount of foreign exchange needed, how much of it will be earned and how much will be borrowed from abroad, and the kinds of imports for which loans are intended. The SPC reviews these plans and in cooperation with the SAEC, the Ministry of Finance, and MOFERT recommends to the State Council the overall number of projects and their associated fi- nancing. Loans for vital projects or projects that have a rapid rate of return are given priority approval. If the imports are for new construction, the plans are also reviewed by the State Economic Commission. Within these guidelines, loans from international finan- cial institutions and foreign governments require the sanction of the SPC and the approval of the State Council. Loans from international development agencies are gen- erally the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance or the China Investment Bank (an organization under the direc- tion of the Ministry); intergovernmental loans are the responsibility of MOFERT, and loans from international financial institutions are the responsibility of the PBC. Government departments, local governments, and enter- prises usually borrow through the BOC (or with its guarantee) or through specialized agencies such as ITICS, rather than borrowing directly abroad themselves. The SPC sets an annual limit on such borrowing. Foreign borrowing in the form of deferred payments requires the approval of MOFERT. Resident organizations may not issue securities for foreign exchange unless approved by the PBC. All commercial borrowing abroad (including bond is- sues) for nonplan purposes requires prior SAEC approval. Joint-venture enterprises and 100 percent foreign-owned companies are required to balance their foreign exchange receipts and payments. While their borrowing is not subject to prior approval by the SAEC, it must be reported.12 All foreign direct investment projects are in principle subject to the approval of MOFERT. However, a number of provincial and local authorities have been granted the authority to approve foreign direct investment projects up to specified amounts. The policy with respect to foreign capital is designed both to make up the insufficiency of domestic capital and to facilitate the introduction of modern technology and management. Most foreign ex- change earned by joint ventures and other enterprises involving nonresident capital must be deposited with the BOC or an authorized bank; outward transfers of capital generally require SAEC approval. Enterprises involved in the exploitation of offshore petroleum reserves may also hold foreign exchange abroad or in the Hong Kong or Macao regions. When a joint venture is wound up, the net claims belonging to the foreign investor may be remitted with SAEC approval through the foreign ex- change account of the joint venture. Alternatively, the foreign investor may apply for repayment of his paid-in capital. Profits of joint ventures, with the exception of firms in special economic zones and the 14 coastal cities and those exploiting petroleum, natural gas, and other specified resources,13 are subject to tax at 33 percent (30 percent basic rate plus a 10 percent surcharge on the assessed tax). As mentioned above, remitted profits are subject to an additional tax of 10 percent, which is waived for joint ventures in the special economic zones and the economic and technological development areas of the 14 coastal cities. A joint venture scheduled to operate for ten years or more may be exempted from income tax in the first one or two profitmaking years and be allowed reductions of 50 percent for the following three years. Joint ventures in low-profit operations, such as farming and forestry, or located in areas considered to be economically under- developed may, upon the approval of the Ministry of Finance, be allowed a further 15-30 percent reduction in income tax for the following ten years. A participant in a joint venture that reinvests its share of profit in China for a period of not less than five years may obtain a refund of 40 percent of the tax paid on the reinvested profit. Certain joint ventures established before the pass- ing of tax regulations in August 1980 are subject to taxes at different rates. Foreign companies, enterprises, and other economic organizations that have establishments in China engaged in independent business operations, cooperative produc- tion, or joint business operations with Chinese enterprises are subject to tax on their net income. There are five levels of tax rates, ranging from 20 percent for the first Y 250,000 of profits to 40 percent for profits exceeding Y 1 million. In addition, a local income tax of 10 percent of the same taxable income is levied. Income from interest on deposits of foreign banks in China's state banks and on loans from foreign banks to China's state banks with a normal interest rate is subject to a 20 percent withholding tax. Foreign state banks originating from countries in which income from interest on deposits and loans of China's state banks is exempted from income tax are correspondingly exempt from this Chinese tax. For in- terest income or leasing fees (less than the value of equipment) earned under credit agreements by foreign business without establishments in China, trade agree- ments, and leasing agreements signed by them with Chinese companies and enterprises during the period 1983-85, income tax is to be levied at the reduced rate 12 To assist individual enterprises balance their foreign receipts and payments, enterprises with a surplus of foreign exchange may sell it to enterprises with a deficit. 13 The special tax rate for these firms is 15 percent. In addition, new joint ventures scheduled to operate for ten years or more may, inter alia, be exempted from taxation in the first and second profitmaking years. 152 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution of 10 percent (half the normal rate) during the validity of the aforesaid agreements; interest earnings from export credits are entitled to income tax exemption. For fees collected by foreign businessmen for the use of special technology provided by them in such fields as agriculture, animal husbandry, research, energy, communications, transport, environmental protection, and the development of important techniques, income tax may, on the approval of the tax authorities, be levied at the reduced rate of 10 percent, or be waived if the technology is advanced and is provided on favorable terms. Foreign investment by Chinese enterprises is subject to approval; profits earned thereby must be sold to the BOC, except for a portion that may be retained locally as working balance. Chinese diplomatic and commercial organizations abroad, as well as businesses abroad and in the Hong Kong and Macao regions, are required to draw up annual foreign exchange plans. Gold The PBC buys and sells gold and has central control over dealings in gold and silver. Sales of gold and silver are restricted to pharmaceutical, industrial, and approved uses. Private persons may hold gold but may not trade or deal in it. The amount of gold, gold products, silver, and silver products that may be imported is unlimited but must be declared on entry. When exporting gold or silver, the exporter must present an import document from customs or a PBC export permit. Nonresidents may buy gold and silver and gold and silver products at special stores but must present the invoice when exporting them. Changes During 1987 Prescription of Currency January 16.

Not for Redistribution COLOMBIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Colombia is the Colombian Peso. The Colombian authorities follow a policy of adjusting the peso in small amounts at relatively short intervals, taking into account (1) the movements of prices in Colombia relative to those in its major trading partners; (2) the level of Colombia's foreign exchange reserves; and (3) Colom- bia's overall balance of payments performance. Exchange surrender and foreign payments are generally effected through the medium of exchange certificates, which are traded in the official market at the official rate and in the stock exchange at varying rates of discount. In the case of export proceeds, exporters have the option of either immediate conversion or acquisition of exchange certifi- cates with a maturity of 90 days. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates in the official market for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, were Col$263.51 and Col$263.70, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are also officially quoted, with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. All exchange transactions are effected through the Bank of the Republic (the central bank) or authorized banks. There are other effective exchange rates, which result from (1) a 6.5 percent tax on coffee export proceeds; (2) tax credit certificates granted at three different percentage rates for most export proceeds; (3) the imposition of a remittance tax at two different rates on certain service payments; and (4) a 95 percent advance exchange license deposit for import payments. The peso equivalent of the Government's exchange receipts from the export tax on coffee is credited to the Treasury's Special Exchange Account at an accounting rate applied by the Bank of the Republic; the Government purchases exchange for all public debt payments and other expenditures included in the national budget at the same exchange rate. The Bank of the Republic stands ready to sell exchange warrants (titulos canjeables por certificados de cambio) to government enterprises in the oil sector and to public sector recipients of external loans against payment in pesos at the certificate market selling rate on the date of issue. These warrants, which are expressed in U.S. dollars and have a maturity of 24 months, are negotiable and may also be exchanged for exchange certificates, provided that the holder presents an exchange license. Within their period of validity, warrants may also be sold to the Bank of the Republic for pesos at the certificate market buy ing rate on the date of repurchase. Warrants bear interest at 1.5 points above the New York prime rate if held by government enterprises in the oil sector, or an interest 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 154 rate equal to that of the external loan, but never higher than the average 30-day rate on primary certificates of deposit at the close of operations in the New York market for the previous day before the certificate is issued if held by public sector recipients of external loans. Warrants held longer than 24 months cannot be converted into exchange certificates but may be resold to the Bank of the Republic at the certificate market rate on the last day of the twen ty - fou r th mon th. Administration of Control All imports and exports require prior registration at the Colombian Institute of Foreign Trade (INCOMEX). Ex- change for paymen ts must be purchased through the Bank of the Republic or the commercial banks, with an approved exchange license issued by the Exchange Office of the Bank of the Republic; however, payments for specified current transactions, when made through credit institu- tions, do not require prior exchange licenses but must be submitted to the Bank of the Republic for ex post authentification. All paymen ts for study purposes require prior authorization by the Colombian Institute for Inter- national Education (!CETEX). The Monetary Board is authorized periodically to draw up a foreign exchange budget, and it did so in 1985. It can also establish priorities w i th in that budget for the delivery of exchange, after setting aside the amounts necessary to cover the obligations of the Bank of the Republic and to service the external debt of the public agencies and the National Federation of Coffee Growers. The Foreign Trade Council (FTC), which includes representatives of the Ministry of Finance, INCOMEX, and other public entities, determines overall import and export policy and assigns foreign exchange for imports in the following order of priority: (1) raw materials and spare parts; (2) imports of El Cerrejon coal project; (3) public sector imports of agricultural products; (4) fuel imports; (5) capital goods imports for export industries; and (6) other imports. A joint Trade Commission (Comision Mixta de Comer do Exterior), w i th representatives from the Ministry of Finance, INCOMEX, and the private sector, serves as an advisory committee on foreign trade. IN- COMEX, through its Import Board, controls those imports that are subject to prior licensing, administers special import-export arrangements in the form of barter, clear- ing, and triangular trade operations, and also sets maxi- mum import prices for certain commodities. The National Council for Economic and Social Policy issues directives concerning direct inves tment in Colombia to the Exchange Office and the National Planning Department. The Ex- change Office keeps an accounting record both of foreign inves tment in Colombia and of debts abroad and controls the movement of foreign capital as well as the transfer of profits, d iv idends, commissions, and royalties for trade- marks, pa ten ts, etc. The sale of proceeds from certain ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution current invisibles is also subject to prior registration with the Exchange Office. The Superintendency of Exchange Control, which is an autonomous agency reporting to the Presidency of the Republic, enforces the control and supervision over exchange transactions and is responsible for applying penalties for any violation of the exchange regulations. Prescription of Currency The Monetary Board establishes the list of currencies that it accepts for exchange surrender and provides for import payments. Payments and receipts are normally effected in U.S. dollars, but importers and exporters are also free to use quoted currencies (see footnote 1). Settlements for commercial transactions with countries with which Colombia has bilateral payments or reciprocal credit agreements2 must be made through special accounts in accordance w i th the provisions of the particular bilateral payments agreement. Settlements between Colombia and Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Par- aguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela are made through accounts maintained w i th in the framework of the multi- lateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). There are also reciprocal credit agreements with the People's Republic of China, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Spain, Yugoslavia, the U.S.S.R., and member countries of the Central American Common Market (CACM). Nonresident Accounts Credit institutions are authorized to receive short-term deposits in foreign currency from physical or juridical persons not resident in Colombia; these deposits are freely available to the holders, but any foreign currency deposits that they may wish to convert into Colombian currency must be sold to the Bank of the Republic. Before releasing the accounts of nonresidents, banks must obtain authorization from the Exchange Office. Imports and Import Payments Imports are subject to one of the following regimes: (1) freely importable goods, requiring only registration with INCOMEX; (2) goods subject to prior approval and requiring an import license; (3) goods included in the prohibited import list; and (4) goods requiring special import-export arrangements for their importation. In the free-import regime, there is a global free list applicable to all countries, a National List applicable only to member countries of the LAI A, and special lists applicable only to less-developed member countries of the LAIA and to members of the Andean Pact. Operations under special import-export arrangements in the form of barter, clearing, and triangular trade arrangements are required to take place in accordance with the relevant regulations issued by the Monetary Board in the event that they give rise to a request for 2 Colombia maintains bilateral payments agreements w i th Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Romania. COLOMBIA foreign exchange or to an obligation to surrender foreign exchange. These arrangements involve payments in for- eign currency in cases when the Colombian importer and the Colombian exporter are not the same juridical entity and, in addition, the import operation is not followed by the export operation contemplated in the arrangement because of noncompliance on the part of the exporter. In such cases, INCOMEX designates a "responsible party," which is requested to provide the value of the import in pesos plus a peso-denominated fine. Similarly, the ex- porter participating in barter arrangements is requested to surrender the foreign exchange earned in cases where the export operation precedes the import operation and the importer fails to comply with the terms of the arrangement. INCOMEX encourages special import-export operations as a means to promote, through other foreign trade mechanisms, exports which would not be carried out otherwise. A distinction is drawn between reimbursable and non- reimbursable imports. Reimbursable imports involve pur- chase of official foreign exchange, including imports of machinery and equipment, financed by international credit institutions. Nonreimbursable imports consist mainly of aid imports under grants and commodities constituting part of a direct investment. All import registrations by public sector agencies are screened by INCOMEX to determine whether local substi- tutes are available. Import licenses for certain items are normally not issued; these include arms and habit-forming drugs, certain foodstuffs, certain textiles and clothing, and jewe lry. Both import licenses and registrations are valid for six months, except for imports of agricultural and livestock products, for which the validity period is three months. Import licenses can be extended for suc- cessive three-month periods, whereas registrations of free imports can be extended for only two successive three- month periods. All imports other than those classified as "minor imports" or shipments with an f.o.b. value of less than US$500 are subject to registration with INCOMEX. Urgently needed spare parts not exceeding US$10,000 are also classified as minor imports and are not subject to registration. The charge for import registration is Col$ 1,500. An advance exchange license deposit (consig- nation) has to be lodged at the official rate for exchange certificates at least 20 calendar days prior to an application for an exchange license. The rate of deposit is 95 percent of the value of the exchange license. Imports of crude oil and petroleum products are subject to prior approval of Empresa Colombiana de Petroleo (ECOPETROL). Import duties are calculated at the "Ministry of Finance exchange rate" (the average selling rate for exchange certificates for the previous month, as determined by the Ministry of Finance). In addition to customs duties, there is an ad valorem tax on imports equal to 5 percent of the c.i.f. value, the proceeds of which go to the Export Promotion Fund. Exempt from this tax are temporary imports; imports by public entities; goods of LAIA origin; imports under the Vallejo Plan; diplomatic, consular, and similar imports; gifts; and imports destined for CORFERIAS 155 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COLOMBIA (International Commerce Fair of Bogota), for the free port of San Andres y Providencia, or effected through the Port of Leticia. With the above exemptions, imports are also subject to a tax of 1.5 percent of the c.i.f. value, the proceeds of which accrue to the ordinary budget of the National Government. All imports (except newspr in t) are subject to a stamp tax of 1 percent of the f.o.b. value, as well as to a temporary surcharge of 8 percent. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are made at the exchange certificate rate. To obtain exchange licenses for freight payments, a freight company must, either directly or through agents in Colombia, lodge a deposit amounting to 95 percent of payment value. Payments for more than 80 percent of total import or export freight are allowed only if it can be established that freight costs payable in local currency amounted to less than 20 percent of total cost. Services may be imported through special import- export arrangements in the form of barter, clearing, and triangular trade arrangements. Most paymen ts for invisibles, including banking com- missions, international air travel, and expenses incurred in the export of noncoffee products, are subject to exchange licenses. Banks may transfer w i thout prior approval payments for certain other current invisibles, including interest on suppliers' credit, medical expenses, support of technical staff abroad, the monthly allowances of students studying abroad with government support, and for the service of registered foreign loans taken up by the private sector. Foreign exchange purchases for travel are limited to the equivalent of US$90 a day, up to US$1,500 a year, for those under 12 years of age; US$180 a day, up to US$3,000 a year, for an adu l t; and up to US$250 a day, within a limit of US$12,500 a year, for "special" travelers (defined as those traveling for reasons that are of particular usefulness in the economic and social development of the country). Remittances abroad for study purposes are subject to the following limits: (1) US$300 for travel; (2) US$400 for books and study material; (3) US$400 to cover thesis fees; (4) up to US$500 monthly for living expenses; (5) up to US$250 mon th ly for expenses incurred by a spouse if course work extends beyond six mon ths; and (6) a once-and-for-all US$500 allowance for unforeseen ex- penditures. Registration fees for courses approved by ICETEX, as well as health and accident insurance for students, are not subject to limits. Requests for foreign exchange for study purposes have to be approved by ICETEX. The transfer of profits accruing to foreign investors is limited to 20 percent of the capital base a year. Profits beyond such limit may count toward increasing the capital base up to a yearly maximum of 7 percent of registered capital and only when at least 50 percent of the amount is reinvested in bonds issued by the Industrial Promotion Institute or in new enterprises satisfying the following criteria: (1) at least 80 percent of their production is exported; and (2) at least 40 percent of their financing is 156 in the form of direct foreign inves tment and/or foreign medium- and long-term loans. These limitations do not hold for multinational enterprises in which at least 80 percent of the capital is held by investors in the countries of the Andean Pact; in such cases, profits can be reinvested and transferred f r e e l y. Foreign tourists who have stayed in Colombia for a period not exceeding three months may, on leaving the coun t ry, purchase foreign currency of up to US$100 on presentation of their passports. A remittance tax of 12 percent is applicable to a number of current paymen ts; for profits transferred by branches of foreign companies, the tax is 20 percent. Colombian nationals and resident foreigners are re- quired to pay a travel tax of US$15 whenever they leave the country. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of certain commodities are prohibited, and exports of certain foods tuffs are subject to quotas. Exports of certain other items, such as beef, are reserved for the Institute de Mercado Agropecuario (!DEMA). No export licenses are required, but prior application for registration is necessary for all exports except samples and Colombian products in noncommercial quantities. When registering an export transaction, exporters must provide INCOMEX with either a personal guarantee in pesos (but without depositing any fund s) or a bank guarantee corresponding to 5 percent of the registered amount, calculated at the M in is try of Finance exchange rate; for petroleum exports, the requ irement is 25 percent of the projected value of production. The periods for surrendering export proceeds are normally as follows: (1) for coffee, w i th in 20 days from the date of registration of the export (180 days for instant coffee); and (2) for other goods, generally within 5 mon ths of registration. However, longer time periods for the surrender of proceeds are permitted for exports to Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela; goods sold on a commission basis; books, magazines, and other printed matter (18 mon ths ); capital goods (2 years); and other goods that normally require more extended payment terms. The Bank of the Republic is empowered in certain cases to retain a portion of the exchange proceeds surrendered by the exporter of any product to repay debts for imports under the Vallejo Plan. All exchange proceeds from exports must be surrendered to the Bank of the Republic, with the exception of export proceeds of Eco- PETROL and exports of minerals associated with state enterprises, which are permitted to retain part of their export proceeds abroad for the settlement of their import costs. On surrendering their export proceeds to the Bank of the Republic, exporters of commodities other than coffee, raw cattle hides, or petroleum and petroleum products receive tax credit certificates (certificados de reembolso tributario, or CERTs) in an amount corresponding to a specified percentage of the total earnings surrendered, converted at the M in is try of Finance exchange rate. Three ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution rates—5 percent, 9 percent, and 14 percent —are applied, depending on the product and the coun try of destination; the rates are calculated on domestic value added for specified assembly operations. These certificates, which are freely negotiable and are quoted on the stock ex- change, are accepted at par by tax offices for the payment of income tax, customs duties, and sales taxes. The surrender of foreign currency earned by exporters can, as an option, be effected by exchanging the foreign currency for exchange certificates (of 90 days' maturity), which are negotiable on the stock exchange. M in imum surrender prices for coffee, bananas, and a few other exports are set from time to time by the Monetary Board. Exports of coffee are subject to the following regulations: (1) A m in imum surrender price (reintegro) is fixed after deduction for freight and insur- ance at US$188.71 a 70-kilogram bag. (2) Exporters pay a tax in foreign exchange at the rate of 6.5 percent ad valorem. Of this tax, 3.2 percent is paid to the National Coffee Fund, and 0.8 percent is paid to the Departmental Committees of Coffee Growers; the remainder provides revenue for the Treasury. (3) Exporters must either surrender without payment (in the form of un trea ted coffee) the equivalent of 35 percent of the volume of excelso coffee that they wish to export (retention cafe- tera) or pay the National Federation of Coffee Growers the peso equivalent. (4) Exports of coffee are subject to an additional tax of 6 percent ad valorem (pasilla y ripio tax); the tax must be paid to the Federation either in kind or in pesos. (5) A committee composed of the Ministers of Finance and Agriculture and the Managing Director of the Federation establishes a domestic buying price for export-type coffee, expressed in pesos per cargo, of 125 kilograms. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange receipts from invisibles must he surren- dered; they are converted against exchange certificates, which can be sold on the stock exchange. In respect of exchange receipts from gifts and the rendering of profes- sional services other than medical, hospital, or educational services, prior authorization from the Exchange Office is required before conversion. Capital All inward and outward capital transfers are effected at the certificate market rate. There is a 95 percent advance payment deposit on all outflows, which must be lodged prior to applying for an exchange license. All foreign inves tment in Colombia, all new foreign loans, direct lines of foreign credit obtained by nonbank residents,3 and the movement of capital previously im- ported (except loans previously registered under Decree 3 Loans by financial entities for the import of goods also require registration; their repayment is authorized by the exchange license covering the relevant import transaction. Such loans are subject to an interest rate ceiling of 2.5 percent over the New York prime rate or the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR). COLOMBIA No. 2322 of September 2, 1965) must be registered with the Exchange Office. Direct foreign investment regulations in Colombia are in accordance with the provisions of Decisions Nos. 24 and 103 of the Cartagena Agreement, which govern foreign investment within the member countries of the Andean Pact. The National Council for Economic and Social Planning (CONPES) can legislate special conditions affect- ing foreign investment so as to overrule the above- mentioned provisions. Foreign investment is required to become 51 percent Colombian-owned by the fifteenth year after its registration, with the exception of investment in enterprises that satisfy one of the following conditions: (1) at least 25 percent of their production is exported; or (2) at least 50 percent of their material inputs are of Colombian origin. Member countries of the Andean Pact are treated as Colombian investors for purposes of ful- filling the Colombian ownership requirement, provided that profit and capital remittances remain within the country of origin and shares are not sold outside the area. Capital imports require prior approval by the National Planning Department, with the exception of capital for the petroleum industry, which requires approval by the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and capital for mineral exploration other than petroleum, which requires approval by both the National Planning Department and the Min- istry of Mines. All foreign banks and their branches must have Colombian majority participation. New foreign di- rect investment in banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions is restricted to investors from mem- ber countries of the Andean Pact and to national or mixed companies on the basis of reciprocal treatment. The purchase of 10 percent or more of the shares of a Colombian financial institution requires the prior approval of the Banking Superintendent. Capital registration enti- tles the investor to export profits and to repatriate capital at the certificate market rate on certain conditions spec- ified in Decree No. 1900 of September 15, 1973. The transfer of profits is limited to 20 percent of registered direct inves tment with certain exceptions (see section on Payments for Invisibles, above); where the profits were earned (and not remitted) prior to the coming into force of Decree Law No. 444 of 1967, the additional remittances must not exceed 3 percent a year. Special legal regimes exist for direct foreign investment in the nickel, coal, and uranium sectors, which waive the 20 percent limit on the transfer of profits abroad. A special regime also applies to a total of 34 different industrial activities, including fishing, food products, leather prod- ucts, chemicals, iron and steel, machine tools, engines, specialized machinery, shipbuilding, automobiles, the aeronautic industry, and photographic equipment, as well as to enterprises exporting at least 50 percent of their output. This regime allows remittances in a percentage of dollar-denominated capital determined by adding 20 points to the average New York prime interest rate prevailing in the year of registration of the foreign in- vestment transaction, as estimated by the Bank of the Republic. Other special regimes are applicable to (1) the 157 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COLOMBIA earthquake-hit area of Popayan, which allow profit re- mittances on invested capital in a percentage equivalent to 25 percent above the average New York prime interest rate in the year of registration of the capital inflows; and (2) bordering regions, which allow transfer of profits up to 24 percent of the dollar-denominated investment. Foreign loans contracted by private Colombian indi- viduals or firms are generally subject to a minimum maturity of three years with one year of grace and an interest rate ceiling of 2.5 percent over the New York prime rate or LIBOR. Such loans are normally permitted only for financing working capital or fixed investment. Special regulations govern the periods for which resident banks may provide import financing from foreign currency borrowed abroad. Foreign loans for national or govern- mental entities in excess of Col$10 million or US$500,000 require prior authorization by the Ministry of Finance and the National Planning Department. For loans to the Government, or guaranteed by the Government, the following are also required: prior authorization by the National Council for Economic and Social Policy and by the Monetary Board, prior consultation with the Inter- parliamentary Committee on Public Credit, and ex post approval by the President of the Republic. Contracts involving royalties, commissions, trademarks or patents, and similar arrangements must be registered with the Exchange Office to enable the beneficiary to make transfers abroad; they also require approval by the Royalties Committee before they can be registered. Colombian nationals who have invested abroad must surrender to the Bank of the Republic, against exchange certificates, not only the interest, profits, commissions, and royalties, but also the proceeds of the sale or liquidation of the investment. Export of capital by resi- dents is restricted, and such export by private individuals is not normally permitted. Current deposit accounts in foreign currency may be held by insurance companies, export firms, transportation companies, and other specified entities, upon prior au- thorization of the Bank of the Republic. A ceiling equiv- alent to 5 percent of their total foreign liabilities is applied on the foreign currency deposits that may be held by domestic financial institutions. Gold Natural and juridical persons may trade in Colombia in gold coins for numismatic purposes only. With this exception, only the Bank of the Republic is entitled to purchase, sell, hold, import, or export gold. Imports of nonmonetary gold are not normally undertaken. The Bank of the Republic purchases locally produced gold at the average price prevailing in the London, Zurich, and New York markets on the day preceding the domestic gold purchase plus 3 percent. The Bank of the Republic levies an ad valorem tax of 2 percent on the total payment received by the miner. The Bank of the Republic makes domestic sales of gold for industrial use directly at a price equivalent to the average quotation in gold markets abroad during the 158 previous day; this price is converted into pesos at the prevailing selling rate of exchange certificates on the date of sale. The assay and refining houses and the mining companies producing gold are under the supervision of the Super- intendency of Exchange Control. In addition, the mining companies and traders must obtain a license from the Superintendency in order to carry on their operations. The Bank of the Republic from time to time issues commemorative gold coins, which are legal tender. Res- idents and nonresidents may freely buy such coins, but export licenses are not normally granted. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments January 7.

Exports and Export Proceeds January 21. The max imum period of one month was set for the final surrender to the Bank of the Republic of foreign exchange corresponding to domestically produced crude oil that oil producers were unable to sell for refining in Colombia. This period would commence on the date that an assessment is issued by the Ministry of Mines for the foreign currency to be surrendered. To guarantee timely surrender, crude oil exporters must fu rn i sh a bank guarantee for the following six-month period equal to 25 percent of the projected value of production. February 18. Exporters who surrender foreign exchange to the Bank of the Republic (under Resolution 99 of 1985 advance export surrender) would have a max imum period of 60 calendar days from the date of the sale of the foreign exchange to make the corresponding exports. March 1.

Not for Redistribution COMOROS (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Comoros is the Comorian Franc, which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CF 1 = F 0.02. The current buying and selling rates for the French franc are CF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies1 are also officially quoted on the basis of the fixed rate of the Comorian franc for the French franc and the Paris exchange market rate for the respective currencies in terms of the French franc. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, the exchange control measures of the Comoros do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Terri- tories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose institute of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank of Comoros. The Ministry of Economy and Finance supervises borrowing and lending abroad, inward direct investment, and all outward investments. Part of the approval authority in respect of exchange control has been delegated to an authorized bank —the sole commer- cial bank —and to the Postal Administration. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through the authorized bank or the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate- General of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency The Central Bank of Comoros maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury; settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in Comorian francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. All settlements with South Africa are prohibited. 1 Currencies quoted on the Paris official market: Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Djibouti francs, ECUs, Finnish markkaa, Greek drachmas, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, and zaires. 160 Imports and Import Payments Imports of South African origin are prohibited, and the import of certain other goods is prohibited from all countries. The import from any source of certain other commodities is subject to individual licensing. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domi- ciled with the authorized bank if the value is CF 500,000 or more. Payments for Invisibles All payments to South Africa are prohibited. Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely. Those to other countries are subject to approval; with the exception of travel, for which there are maximum allocations, such approvals are generally given liberally. For tourist travel, residents traveling to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Ac- count countries may take out the equivalent of CF 125,000 in bank notes and any amount in other means of payment. Residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain up to CF 250,000 in foreign currency a person a trip. The maximum that may be allocated in bank notes is CF 125,000; the remainder may be in the form of a bank transfer, traveler's checks, a certified check, or any other means of payment. For business travel, a special allocation may be authorized by the Central Bank of Comoros upon the request of the au- thorized bank. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. With a few exceptions, exports to France (as defined above), Mo- naco, and the Operations Account countries are free of license. Most exports to other countries require licenses. Proceeds from exports to foreign countries must normally be collected, and the receipts repatriated within 30 days of the expiration of the commercial contract and sold immediately to the authorized bank. All export transac- tions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with the authorized bank if the value is CF 500,000 or more. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and, if received in foreign currency, be surren- dered within one month of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of domestic and foreign bank notes and coin. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Capital All settlements between the Comoros and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between the Comoros and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Opera- tions Account countries are, in principle, free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval, but capital receipts from such countries normally are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, inward direct inves tmen t, and all outward inves tmen t; these controls relate to the trans- actions themselves, not to payments or receipts. COMOROS Gold Imports and exports of monetary gold require prior authorization. Imports and exports of articles containing gold are subject to declaration, but transfers of personal jewelry within the limit of 500 grams a person are exempt from such declaration.

Exchange transactions in French francs between the BE AC and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1. Buy ing and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rates for the currencies concerned in the Paris exchange market. Payments to France and its Overseas Departments and Territories, Monaco, and the Operations Account coun- tries (see section on Administration of Control, below), as well as the purchase of those countries' bank notes and traveler's checks, are subject to a commission of 0.75 percent, with a m in imum charge of CFAF 75; exempt from this commission are payments of the State, the Postal Administration, and the BEAC, salaries of Con- golese diplomats abroad, expenditures of official missions abroad, scholarships of persons studying or training abroad, and debt service payments due from companies that have entered into an agreement with the Congo. Most payments to other foreign countries and credits to Foreign Accounts in Francs are subject to a commission of 1 percent or, for foreign exchange purchased by the Diamond Purchase Office, 0.50 percent; these commis- sions are subject to a m in imum of CFAF 100. A com- mission of 0.25 percent is levied on all capital transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Payments to the following countries, although subject to declaration, are unrestricted: (1) France (and its Over- seas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked w i th the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Ben in, Bur- kina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo).

Import and export licenses are issued by the Foreign Trade Directorate in the Ministry of Commerce. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Since the Congo is an Operations Account country, settlements w i th France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting of BEAC bank notes to Foreign Accounts in Francs is permitted when they have been mailed to the BEAC agency in Brazzaville by the foreign correspondent of an authorized bank. Imports and Import Payments Imports from all sources require prior authorization. An indicative annual import program distinguishes five zones: (1) the countries of the Central African Customs and Economic Union (UDEAC); (2) France; (3) other countries of the French Franc Area; (4) European Com- munities (EC) countries other than France; and (5) all remaining countries. All imports under this program require licenses. The quotas for non-EC countries may be used to import goods originating in any country outside the French Franc Area. All import transactions relating to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries must be domiciled w i th an authorized bank. Licenses for imports from countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank, and they require the visa of the Foreign Trade Directorate and the General Directorate of Credit and Financial Relations. The approved import license entitles importers to purchase the necessary exchange, provided that the shipping documen ts are submitted to an autho- rized bank. All imports must be insured w i th the state insurance company, Societe d'Assurances et de Reassurances du Congo (SARC). To imp lement this measure, the Congo- lese Customs Service releases imports only after an insurance certificate issued by the SARC has been produced.

Residents traveling as tourists to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, the Operations Ac- count countries, or Zaire may obtain an exchange allo- cation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a person a trip (CFAF 87,500 for children under 10 years) or CFAF 10,000 if the duration of the trip is less than 24 hours, for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange in excess of CFAF 5,000 remaining after return to the Congo must be surrendered. For business travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a person a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 400,000 a trip; additional amounts may be authorized in appropriate cases. The use of credit cards abroad by residents is prohibited. There are special facilities for travelers to Kinshasa who request no foreign means of payment other than Zairian bank notes. Resi- dents traveling to France (as defined above), Monaco, or an Operations Account country may take out CFAF 25,000 (CFAF 12,500 for children under 10 years) in BE AC bank notes. Residents and nonresidents traveling to foreign countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, the Operations Account countries, or Zaire may freely take out up to a max imum of CFAF 10,000 in BEAC bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes issued by any other ins t i tu te of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury. The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreigner working in the Congo is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Exports and Export Proceeds In principle, all exports require prior authorization, but most exports to countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely; among the exceptions are commodities exported by the National Marketing Office for Agricultural Products (Office National de Commercialisation des Pro- duits Agricoles) and by the National Marketing Office for Timber (Office Congolais du Bois). Proceeds from exports to foreign countries must be col- lected and repatriated, generally w i th in 180 days of arrival of the commodities at their destination. Export proceeds must be surrendered within a month of the due date. All export transactions relating to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Proceeds from Invisibles All amounts due from residents of foreign countries in respect of services and all income earned in those coun- PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO tries from foreign assets must be collected when due and surrendered within a month of the due date.

Capital Capital movements between the Congo and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free, though ex post declarations are re- quired. Such movements to countries that are not mem- bers of the BEAC are subject to a commission of 0.25 percent. Most international capital transactions are sub- ject to prior authorization. Capital transfers abroad require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from abroad generally are permitted freely. All foreign securities, foreign currency, and titles embodying claims on foreign countries or nonresidents that are held in the Congo by residents or nonresidents must be deposited with authorized banks in the Congo. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, advertising, and offering for sale of foreign securities in the Congo; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. Direct investments abroad2 require the prior approval of the Minister of Finance; the full or partial liquidation of such investments also requires the prior approval of the Minister. Foreign direct investments in the Congo3 require prior approval by the Minister of Finance, unless they involve the creation of a mixed-economy enterprise. The full or partial liquidation of direct investments in the Congo must be declared to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Congolese investments abroad or foreign investments in the Congo, must be reported to the Minister within 20 days. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in the Congo requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) borrowing backed by a guarantee from the Congolese Government, and (2) shares similar to securities whose issue, advertis- ing, or offering for sale in the Congo has already been authorized. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance.

Lending by residents to nonresidents is subject to exchange control, and all lending in CFA francs to nonresidents is prohibited, unless special authorization is obtained from the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans in foreign currencies granted by registered banks; (2) other loans in foreign currencies when the total amount out- standing of these loans does not exceed the equivalent of CFAF 5 million for any one lender; and (3) foreign currency loans whose interest rate does not exceed 5 percent a year and whose maturity is two years or less. The making of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be reported to the General Directorate of Credit and Financial Relations w i th in 20 days. Under the Inves tment Code of April 26, 1973, a number of privileges may be granted to approved foreign invest- ments. The Code provides for four categories of prefer- ential trea tmen t. Gold By virtue of Decree No. 66/236 of July 29, 1966, as amended by Decree No. 66/265 of August 29, 1966, residents are free to hold gold in the form of coin, art objects, or jewelry; however, to hold gold in any other form or to import or export gold in any form, from or to any other country, the prior authorization of the Minister of Finance is required. Exempt from the latter requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BE AC, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quan t i ty of gold (such as gold- filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. There are no official exports of gold. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments April 1.

Not for Redistribution COSTA RICA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Costa Rica is the Costa Rican Colon. Costa Rica follows a flexible exchange rate system under which the exchange rate is adjusted from time to time, taking into account relative rates of inflation between Costa Rica and its trading partners and balance of pay- ments developments. All transactions, with the exception of allowance for studies abroad (see below), take place at the unified exchange rate. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling banking rates were C 68.75 and C 69.75 per US$1, respectively. The official exchange rate of C 20.00 = US$1 is used exclusively for granting foreign exchange to students in foreign countries who registered with the Central Bank prior to 1981. The spread between the buying and selling rates in the banking exchange market is legally set at C 1.00. Purchases and sales of other Central American currencies are effected on the basis of quotations in coiones, taking into account the value of those currencies in terms of U.S. dollars in the parallel exchange markets of the respective countries. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk operating in the official or the com- mercial banking sector. Costa Rica formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 1, 1965. Administration of Control Exchange controls are operated by the Central Bank. The only institutions authorized to deal with foreign exchange transactions are the Central Bank of Costa Rica, the state commercial banks, and certain private banks authorized by the Central Bank. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency In practice, nearly all exchange transactions in Costa Rica are expressed in U.S. dollars. Beginning from May 20, 1985, settlements in respect of all trade with Central American countries are required to be made in U.S. dollars. Payments to and from Colombia in respect of commercial operations, services, and capital may be made in U.S. dollars through a reciprocal credit arrangement between the member central banks of the Central Amer- ican Clearing House and the Bank of the Republic of Colombia. Payments to Mexico in respect of trade, invisibles, and capital may also be made in U.S. dollars under an agreement between the member central banks of the Central American Clearing House and the Bank of Mexico. Imports and Import Payments There is no import licensing, and all import payments may be made freely. All imports must be registered in the Central Bank prior to removal from customs or prior to the submission of requests for foreign exchange, with the following exceptions: (1) merchandise whose c.i.f. value is less than US$500; (2) temporary imports; (3) domestically produced goods reimported into Costa Rica; (4) imports by diplomatic and foreign missions and inter- national organizations; and (5) household items. Imports made on a barter basis require a barter license (licencia de trueque), issued by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Imports from South Africa are prohibited. In addition to any applicable customs du ty, the follow- ing taxes are levied on imports: (1) a stamp tax of 3 percent of the customs du ty; (2) a sales tax of 10 percent ad valorem, from which certain essential items are ex- empt; and (3) a selective consumption tax at rates varying from 10 percent to 75 percent, depending on the consid- ered degree of essentiality. In addition, other levies are imposed as follows: (1) for inputs, if nominal protection (ad valorem tax plus 3 percent pursuant to Law No. 6966) is less than 8 percent, a surcharge is applied until the 8 percent level is reached; (2) for capital goods—if nominal protection is less than 10 percent, a surcharge is applied until the 10 percent level is reached. There are no import surcharges on consumer goods. Surcharges on imports from Central America are levied only on capital goods and at a maximum rate of 2 percent. Vehicles used in paid (public service) transportation, trucks and other work vehicles, ambulances and hearses, simple off-road passenger vehicles, and chassis with single or dual cab are exempt from the surcharge. Minibuses with a dis- placement of up to 1,250 cubic centimeters are subject to a surcharge of 10 percent, and those with greater dis- placement are subject to a surcharge of 100 percent. Other vehicles with displacements of under 1,300 cubic centimeters are exempt from the surcharge, but those with a larger displacement are subject to a surcharge of 150 percent. Minibuses for collective transportation and vehicles with displacement of up to 1,300 cubic centimeters or with a customs value of up to US$5,QOO are exempt from the selective consumption tax. Other vehicles are subject to an ad valorem selective consumption tax of 75 percent. Vehicles with a weight of up to 1 ton are subject to a 25 percent selective consumption tax, and those with a weight exceeding 1 ton are exempt. Pickup trucks with a weight of up to 1 ton are also subject to a selective consumption tax of 25 percent. Payments for Invisibles Withholding taxes of 15 percent and 10 percent, re- spectively, are levied on remittances abroad of dividends and interest; interest on certain borrowing abroad (e.g., from government banks) is exempt. Costa Rican nationals and resident foreigners traveling abroad by air, sea, or land must pay a travel exit tax in coiones equivalent to 165 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COSTA RICA US$10; Costa Rican nationals who reside abroad must pay, in addition, a consular fee of US$20 upon renewal of their passports abroad. For residents covered by Law No. 4812 (pensionados rentistas) and residents not so covered, the payment differs from the national one. Costa Rican diplomats and certain Peace Corps officials pay an exit fee of only C 6, provided their passports state that they are exempt from the above charges. Civil servants and students are not exempt from these payments unless so determined by the Ministry of Finance or the Migration Council. Costa Rican minors are subject to all of the above payments, except for dependents of diplomatic parents, who pay only the C 6 exit fee. Commercial banks dealing in the unified market may sell foreign exchange —without prior authorization of the Central Bank —in the following amounts: (1) for foreign travel, a limit of US$100 a day up to a maximum of US$800 a traveler (upon presentation of passport and travel tickets, commercial banks are authorized to sell the equivalent of this amount in the currency of a Central American country to travelers to Central American coun- tries other than Panama); (2) for family remittances, up to US$500 a month a person to a maximum of US$1,000 a family; and (3) for registered students, a maximum of US$500 a month for living expenses, in addition to tu i t ion, textbooks, and insurance, upon presentation of docu- ments. Subject to approval by the Central Bank, these limits may be exceeded where justified by evidence of bona fide current expenditures for the specified purpose. Prior authorization by the Central Bank is also required for any foreign exchange purchases for the servicing of private foreign debt, foreign payment of dividends, roy- alties, patent rights, and professional services. Exports and Export Proceeds The Central Bank supervises exports to ensure that exchange proceeds are surrendered to the banking system; the latter sell to the Central Bank all of their purchases. Exporters of nontraditional commodities to markets out- side Central America are entitled to receive tax credit certificates (CATs, which are freely negotiable) for 15 percent of the f.o.b. value in the case of exports to the United States and Puerto Rico, and for 15 or 20 per- cent for destinations outside Central America. In addition, exporters of nontraditional commodities eligible for CATs may also receive certificates for increases in exports (CIEXs) for 4-10 percent of the increase in the f.o.b. value of exports over the preceding calendar year; the certificates are redeemable against cash at the Central Bank. Licenses from the Central Bank are necessary for the exportation of merchandise. Exports to Nicaragua must be on the basis of advance payment in U.S. dollars, barter arrangement, or letters of credit confirmed by a major international bank. In addition to the export license from the Central Bank, other export licenses are required as follows: strategic materials, such as armaments, muni- tions, scrap iron, and scrap of nonferrous base metals (from the Ministry of Economy and Commerce); sugar 166 (from the Agricultural Industrial Board for Sugarcane); beans, rice, potatoes, onions, cotton, meat, and purebred cattle (from the National Council of Production); airplanes (from the Civil Aviation Board and the Ministry of Economy and Commerce); Indian art objects made of gold, stone, or clay (from the National Museum); tobacco (from the Tobacco Defense Board); lumber, root of ipecacuanha, certain livestock, and animals and plants of forest origin (from the Ministry of Agriculture and Live- stock); and coffee (from the Coffee Institute); in addition, when there is a lien on coffee in favor of a bank, that bank's approval is required before the Central Bank grants an export license. Exports to South Africa are prohibited. The exchange proceeds from coffee, bananas, sugar, beef, bovine cattle, and other perishable items must be surrendered within 30 days of shipment; within 90 days of shipment for exports of semiperishable goods; and w i th in 180 days of shipment for other industrial products, except for capital goods, which, by decision of the Central Bank of Costa Rica, may be granted periods of up to 360 days. Foreign-owned banana companies that have con- tracts with the Government must surrender their net export proceeds, which are calculated by deducting from their gross export proceeds (1) profits obtained during the year from their transactions in Costa Rica; (2) the allow- ance for depreciation on their investment in Costa Rica that is acceptable to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service; (3) the export tax on bananas payable in foreign currency; and (4) the cost of imports made during the year that were necessary for their normal business in Costa Rica. There are no taxes on nontraditional exports to countries outside the Central American area and Panama; traditional exports do pay tax, in some cases, graduated in line with the international prices. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles are free from controls or restrictions, but receipts from invisibles may be ex- changed into colones only at the Central Bank or other authorized ins t i tu t ions. Capital All capital transfers between residents and nonresidents may be made, subject to prior authorization by the Central Bank. Capital received by the private sector may be registered at the Central Bank of Costa Rica, provided that it meets various requirements, including the require- ments that (1) the project financed with the funds has (or will eventually have), directly or indirectly, a positive effect on Costa Rica's balance of paymen ts; (2) the amount of the capital is not less than US$5,000; and (3) the individual concerned sells the foreign exchange to the Central Bank. The registration guarantees the individual that the Central Bank will sell to him the exchange required to service the debt at the exchange rate in force at the time the servicing is effected. The National Budget Au thor i ty1 is in charge of authorizing the negotiation of 1 Composed of the M in is ter of Finance, the M in i s ter of P lann ing, and the President of the Central Bank. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution new external credits contemplated by the Central Gov- ernmen t, decentralized agencies, and state enterprises. Foreign and domestic capital transferred from abroad may be deposited as time deposits in U.S. dollars w i th agent banks in the form of specified foreign currencies or be invested in certificates of deposit denominated in colones; such fund s, when they mature, are repaid in the currency in which the deposits were made. Gold The Central Bank may purchase, sell, or hold gold coin or bars as part of the monetary reserves in accordance with regulations established by its Board. Private physical and juridical persons may negotiate freely, at home or abroad, domestically produced gold (except national ar- chaeological treasures), provided there is no infraction of international agreements. As in the case of other exports, licenses from the Central Bank are required for exports of gold. Gold may also be held in any form in Costa Rica. The Central Bank may sell unrefined gold to artistic or professional users. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments January 1. Import surcharges on consumer goods were eliminated. For goods imported from Central American COSTA RICA countries, surcharges may be levied only on capital goods and at a rate not exceeding 2 percent. April 1. All imports were required to be registered in the Central Bank prior to removal from customs or prior to the submission of requests for foreign exchange, with the following exceptions: (1) merchandise whose c.i.f. value is less than US$500; (2) temporary imports; (3) domestically produced goods reimported into Costa Rica; (4) imports by diplomatic and foreign missions and inter- national organizations; and (5) household items. June 25. The selective consumption tax was eliminated on vehicles with a customs value of up to US$5,000 or with engine displacements of up to 1,300 cubic centime- ters. It was reintroduced at a 25 percent rate on pickup trucks with a capacity of up to 1 ton. October 1. If nominal protection on inputs is less than 8 percent, a surcharge would be applied to bring the level to 8 percent; similarly, if nominal protection on capital goods is less than 10 percent, a surcharge would be applied to bring the level to 10 percent. Gold February 5. The Central Bank adopted a regulation permitting the sale of unrefined gold. To date, this gold is not sold for artistic or professional uses. 167 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COTE D'lVOIRE (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Cote d'lvoire is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.10 per mill on transfers from countries outside the West African Monetary Union (WAMU), and of 2.50 per mill on transfers to countries outside the WAMU.2 Banks and the postal system also levy a commission on transfers to all countries outside the WAMU, part of which must be surrendered to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of measures relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, the exchange control measures of Cote d'lvoire do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Spot foreign exchange cover is limited to imports effected by means of documentary credits; the transaction must be domiciled with an authorized intermediary, and goods must be shipped within eight days of the exchange operation. Forward exchange cover for eligible imports must not extend beyond one month for certain specified goods and three months for goods designated as essential commodities; no renewal of cover is possible. Forward cover against exchange rate risk is permitted, with prior authorization from the Directorate of External Finance and Credit, only in respect of payments for imports of goods and only for the currency stipulated in the com- mercial contract. There are no official schemes for cur- rency swaps or guaranteed exchange rates for debt servicing. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of External Finance and Credit in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The BCEAO is authorized to collect any information necessary to compile the balance of payments statistics, either directly or through the banks, other financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and no- 1 The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de I'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2 Transfers between member countries of the WAMU are subject to the flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO. 168 taries public. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks or the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate of External Trade in the Ministry of Commerce. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Since Cote d'lvoire is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Current payments to or from The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mau- ritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BCEAO bank notes may be credited to Foreign Accounts in Francs when they have been mailed to the BCEAO agency in Abidjan by authorized banks' foreign correspondents. Otherwise, the crediting to nonresident accounts of BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is prohibited. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, without prior au- thorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes that are mailed by authorized intermediaries to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. Under a decree that came into force on January 1,1982, all imports are classified into four categories, as follows: (1) prohib- ited imports (e.g., wheat flour, and used garments); (2) import items (e.g., paints, matches, and detergents) for which import licenses are obligatory for each import transaction exceeding CFAF 25,000, f.o.b.; (3) import items requiring a declaration of intent to import; and (4) import items requiring both prior authorization and a declaration of intent to import; in the last two cases, (3) and (4), the requirements apply only to individual trans- actions exceeding CFAF 100,000, f.o.b. As noted below, certain other import items are subject to annual volume or value quotas. Imports of rice depend on domestic production, since they are intended as a supplementary means of satisfying domestic demand; such imports take place on the basis of an international invitation to bid or a government-to-government contract. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution All other imports may be made freely from any coun try; however, as mentioned above, when valued f.o.b. at CFAF 100,000 or more, they are subject to the submission of a declaration of intent to import or to prior authorization, and when the f.o.b. value exceeds CFAF 1.5 mil- lion or more, they are subject to mandatory preshipment inspection by international agencies to control their price, quantity, and quality. Tariffs have been raised with a view to harmonizing effective protection of local produc- tion; in the case of some goods, quotas have been replaced by temporary surcharges scheduled to decline progres- sively during a five-year period. Imports from member countries of the West African Economic Commun i ty (WAEC) are exempt from the surcharge. All import operations relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000; transactions of lower value also must be domiciled with an authorized bank if a financial transaction is to be undertaken before customs clearance. The import licenses or import attestations entitle import- ers to purchase the necessary foreign exchange, but not earlier than eight days before shipment, if a documentary credit is opened, or only on the due date of paymen t, if the commodities have already been imported. Effec t ive June 15, 1981, foreign exchange for import payments must be purchased either on the settlement date specified in the commercial contract or at the time when the required down payment is made. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are per- mitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Trans- fers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. Any resident may make paymen ts abroad freely at any time through an authorized bank, up to the equivalent of CFAF 50,000 a month without submitting any documentation. Residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation for tourism of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a person a year (CFAF 87,500 for children under 10 years). For business travel, a special foreign exchange allocation is authorized up to a maximum of CFAF 20,000 a day and CFAF 400,000 a trip. Any foreign exchange remaining in excess of CFAF 5,000 after return to Cote dTvoire must be surrendered. The transfer of the fu ll basic salary of a foreigner working in Cote d'lvoire is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place w i th in three mon ths of the pay period. Resident and nonresident travelers to foreign countries may take out BCEAO bank notes up to CFAF 25,000. Travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank COTE D'lVOIRE notes; however, if they travel to a country that is not a member of the WAMU, the amount taken out must be declared to customs if it exceeds CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers to foreign countries may freely take out foreign bank notes and coin up to the equivalent of CFAF 175,000, as well as any traveler's checks, etc., issued abroad. Subject to documentation, they may also take out any amount of traveler's checks, etc., in foreign currency established in their name after conversion of foreign currency into CFA francs, or drawn against a Foreign Account in Francs, or in a foreign currency in Cote d'lvoire. Nonresidents who have made a currency declaration upon entry or are able to show the proper banking notices may take out larger amounts. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Most exports are free of license and require a declaration only. Exports of certain processed and unprocessed agricultural com- modities, however, require the issuance of an export license by the Directorate of External Trade. An export premium is applied on the basis of the domestic value added in locally manufactured products and agricultural products, excluding coffee, cocoa, cotton, and pineapples. Export taxes are waived for products receiving the pre- m ium, and products covered by taxation agreements under the WAEC are not eligible for the premium. The due date for payment in respect of exports to foreign countries, including those in the French Franc Area, must not be later than 180 days after the arrival of the goods at their destination. Regardless of the currency of settle- ment and the buy ing country, export receipts must be collected and repatriated through authorized intermediary banks w i th in one month of the due date. Regardless of destination, all export transactions must be domiciled with an authorized bank when valued at more than CFAF 500,000. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered within two mon ths of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may import any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area; residents bringing in foreign bank notes or other foreign means of payment must surrender any amount in excess of CFAF 5,000 to an authorized bank within eight days and must make a declaration to customs upon en try. Capital Capital movements between Cote d'lvoire and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account 169 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COTE D'lVOIRE countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, over foreign inward direct inves tmen t, over all outward investment in foreign countries, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Cote d'lvoire. Such operations require prior authorization by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, as do issues by Cote d'lvoire companies. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Government of Cote d'lvoire, and (2) shares similar to securities whose issuing, advertising, or offering for sale in Cote d'lvoire has already been authorized. With the exception of controls relating to foreign securities, these measures do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, member countries of the WAMU, and the Operations Account countries. Special controls are main- tained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate and building operations abroad; these special con- trols also apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All investments abroad by residents of Cote d'lvoire require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance.3 Foreign direct investments in Cote d'lvoire,4 are subject to prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Effective June 15, 1981, at least 75 percent of investments abroad by residents of Cote d'lvoire must be financed by borrowing abroad. The liquidation of investments, whether direct investments or not, in Cote d'lvoire or abroad must similarly be reported in advance to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Cote d'lvoire investments abroad or foreign investments in Cote d'lvoire, must be reported to the Minister within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans taken up by industrial firms to finance transactions abroad, to finance imports into or exports from Cote d'lvoire, or by approved international 3 Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons resident in Cote d'lvoire and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies resident in Cote d'lvoire. 4 Including those made in Cote d'lvoire by companies that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Cote d'lvoire of foreign companies. 170 trading houses to finance international merchanting trans- actions; (2) loans contracted by authorized banks; and (3) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans, including the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower, and provided that the annual interest rate does not exceed the normal market rate. The repay- ment of loans constituting a direct investment is subject to the formalities prescribed for the liquidation of direct investments. The repayment of other loans requires au- thorization only if the loan itself was subject to prior approval. Lending abroad is subject to exchange control authorization. Under the investment code introduced in 1984, special incentives are provided for foreign and domestic invest- ments in certain priority sectors and priority geographical areas. The incentives include exemption from customs duties and tariffs on all imported capital equipment and spare parts for investment projects, provided that no equivalent item is produced in Cote d' Ivoire. In addition, all such investments are exempted for a specified period, depending on the investment sector or area, from cor- porate profit taxes, patent contributions, and capital assets taxes. In general, the exemption covers 100 percent of applicable tax up to the third-to-last year of the exemption period, and is reduced progressively to 75 percent of the tax in the second-to-last year of the exemption period, 50 percent in the penultimate year, and 25 percent in the last year of the exemption period. Imports of intermediate goods or raw materials for which no equivalents are produced locally are not exempt from import duties and taxes. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Cote d'lvoire. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance, which is rarely granted. Exempt from this requirement are: (1) imports and exports by the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold articles up to a weight of 250 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports and exports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments August 11. Import duties on a number of products were raised (Decree No. 87-822). Exports and Export Proceeds October 28. The system of export premium payments was extended to a number of manufacturing industries, including chemical and metallurgic industries, and to the agricultural sector, with the exception of coffee, cocoa, cotton, and pineapples. The premium rates for a number of products were raised to offset the impact on exports of the increase in import duties (Decree No. 87-1276). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CYPRUS (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Cyprus is the Cyprus Pound. The exchange rate of the Cyprus pound is adjusted daily, with the aim of maintaining its effective relationship with the currencies of the main trading partners. On December 30, 1987 the official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, were £C .4413 and £C .4419, respectively, per US$1. The Central Bank of Cyprus also quotes daily buying and selling rates for the deutsche mark, the Greek drachma, and the pound ster- ling. It also quotes indicative rates for other foreign currencies1 on the basis of market rates in international money market centers. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The Central Bank offers authorized dealers (banks) facilities for for- ward purchases of U.S. dollars and pounds sterling for exports and tourism for periods of up to 12 months. Rates for longer periods up to two years for exports are also available on an ad hoc basis, when justified. Cover for imports is normally provided up to six months. When justified (e.g., payments for imports of raw materials for exports or capital goods), rates may be quoted up to 15 months on request. Forward contracts must be based on genuine commercial commitments. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Central Bank in cooperation with authorized dealers. Au thor i ty to approve applications for the allocation of foreign exchange for a number of purposes has been delegated to authorized dealers. Prescription of Currency Payments may be made by crediting Cyprus pounds to an External Account, or in any foreign currency;2 the proceeds of exports to all countries may be received in Cyprus pounds from an External Account, or in any foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts Residents of countries outside Cyprus may open and maintain with authorized banks nonresident accounts in Cyprus pounds, designated External Accounts, or Foreign Currency Accounts. These accounts may be credited freely with payments from nonresidents of Cyprus (such as transfers from other External Accounts or Foreign Currency Accounts), proceeds from sales of any foreign currency by nonresidents (including declared bank notes), and the entire proceeds, including capital appreciation, 1 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs (commercial), Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 2 Foreign currencies are all currencies other than the Cyprus pound. from the sale of an investment made by a nonresident in Cyprus with the approval of the Central Bank and with authorized payments in Cyprus pounds. External Ac- counts and Foreign Currency Accounts may be debited for payments to residents and nonresidents, for remit- tances abroad, for transfers to other External Accounts or Foreign Currency Accounts, and for payments in cash (Cyprus pounds) in Cyprus. Companies registered or incorporated in Cyprus that are accorded nonresident status by the Central Bank as well as their nonresident employees may maintain External Accounts and Foreign Currency Accounts in Cyprus or abroad, as well as local disbursement accounts for meeting their payments in Cyprus. Blocked Accounts are maintained in the name of nonresidents for funds that may not immediately and in their entirety be transferred outside Cyprus under the existing exchange control regulations. Blocked funds may either be held as deposits or be invested in government securities or government-guaranteed securities. Income earned on blocked funds so invested is freely transferable to the nonresident beneficiary or it may be credited to an External Account or Foreign Currency Account. In ad- dition to income, the principal released in each such case annually for transfer outside Cyprus may not exceed £C 5,000. Funds can also be released from Blocked Accounts to meet reasonable educational expenses in Cyprus of the account holder's children, reasonable living expenses of the account holder while visiting Cyprus, donations to charitable institutions in Cyprus, and for other authorized purposes. Imports and Import Payments Imports of fresh fru i ts, fresh vegetables, and fresh meat are prohibited. Most other imports are free of licensing requirements. Only imports of certain commodities re- quire an import license. Such commodities include goods produced or manufactured locally, as well as all machin- ery, plant and equipment, spare parts and accessories. The Minister of Commerce and Industry may take measures whenever required to regulate the importation of goods for the encouragement of local production and manufacture. Exchange is allocated to pay for imports freely and without restriction through authorized banks, provided that documentary evidence of shipment or actual importation of goods is available. Advance payments before shipment require the prior approval of the Central Bank, except for imports whose value does not exceed £C 500. Payments for imports requiring a license are expected to be made within the time limits specified on the license. An import surcharge of 6 percent (3.9 percent for imports from European Communities (EC) countries) ad valorem is levied on all imports except food, feedstuff, Pharmaceuticals, and goods imported by the Government. 171 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CYPRUS Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles abroad require the approval of the Central Bank, but approval for certain types of payments has been delegated to authorized banks. Profits, dividends, and interest from approved foreign investments are transferable abroad without limitation, after payment of any due charges and taxes. Insurance premiums due to foreign insurance companies are remittable after de- duction of all contingencies. Allowances are granted for study abroad at colleges, universities, or other institutions of higher education, and certain lower-level institutions of learning. Exchange allowances are based on the cost of living and cover the fu ll amount of tuition fees plus living expenses for the student. For studies in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East, Yugoslavia, and Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) countries, the maximum yearly allowance for living expenses is £C 1,800; for Canada and the United States, £C 4,400; Austria, the Benelux countries, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland, and the United King- dom, £C 3,000; and for all other countries, £C 2,600. There is no limit for the remittance of foreign exchange for payment of tuition fees. The exchange allowance for tourist travel is £C 450 a person per trip. The allowance for business travel is not fixed, but depends on the length of stay abroad, the country or countries to be visited, and the purpose. For medical treatment abroad, the amount is unlimited but based on actual expenses. On leaving Cyprus, travelers may take out with them up to £C 50 in currency notes. There is no limit on the amount of foreign currency notes that departing residents may take out of the country as part of any of their foreign exchange allowances. Nonresident travelers may take out any amount of foreign currency notes they declared on arrival. Foreign currency notes equivalent up to US$1,000 need not be declared, except when they are to be deposited with an authorized dealer. In addition, authorized banks may convert up to £C 100 into foreign currency for departing nonresidents. Furthermore, authorized banks are permitted to issue to nonresidents as well as to resident employees of offshore companies any amount of foreign currency notes against external fund s. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of potatoes and carrots are subject to control by the respective Marketing Boards, and those of wheat, barley, and maize to control by the Cyprus Grain Com- mission. Exports of cement are subject to a license for the purpose of ensuring adequate domestic supply. All exports are subject to licensing when the f.o.b. value exceeds £C 100, to ensure the repatriation of the sales proceeds. Export proceeds must be surrendered without delay. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be sold to an authorized bank. Persons entering Cyprus may bring in any amount 172 in foreign currency notes and up to £C 50 in Cyprus currency notes. Capital Transfers abroad of a capital nature are not normally permitted. Applications for direct investment abroad by residents are approved only in cases where the proposed inves tmen ts will promote exports of goods and services and provided the amount required is small. Inves tmen ts in Cyprus by nonresidents require prior approval of the Central Bank. In considering applications, due regard is given to the purpose of the investment, the extent of possible foreign exchange savings or earnings, introduction of know-how, and, in general, the benefits accruing to the national economy. Foreign direct invest- ment is normally permitted in selected fields of production, such as export-oriented industries and new products. Annual profits and proceeds from the liquidation of approved foreign inves tmen ts, including capital gains, may be repatriated in full at any time, after payment of any charges and taxes. With the permission of the Council of Ministers, alien nonresidents may acquire in Cyprus immovable property for use as a residence or holiday home; they are required to pay the value of such property in foreign exchange. The sales proceeds of such property are transferable abroad up to the amount originally paid for the purchase of the property; the balance, if any, is transferable at the yearly rate of £C 5,000, plus interest. The same treatment is accorded to nonresident Cypriots purchasing a holiday home in Cyprus. Residents of Cyprus (Cypriots or foreign nationals) who take up residence outside Cyprus may transfer abroad immediately up to £C 5,000; any excess amount is de- posited in a Blocked Account and released at the rate of £C 5,000 a year. The transfer abroad of funds resulting from estates and intestacies and from the sale of real estate is limited to £C 5,000, with any excess amount to be credited to a Blocked Account and also released at the rate of £C 5,000 a year. Interest earned on blocked accounts is freely transferable abroad. Transactions in foreign securities owned by residents require prior permission from the Central Bank. In prin- ciple, all securities held abroad by residents are subject to registration. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Cyprus for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities, authorized dealers in gold, and industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Authorized dealers in gold are permitted to import gold only for the purpose of disposing of it to industrial users. The export of gold requires the permission of the exchange control authorities. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement „ September 1.

Not for Redistribution DENMARK (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Denmark is the Danish Krone. Den- mark participates with Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, Denmark maintains the spot exchange rates between the Danish krone and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in ECUs (European Currency Un i ts). The agreement implies that the National Bank of Denmark (the central bank) stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. On December 31, 1987 these rates were as follows: Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 100 deutsche mark 100 French francs 100 Netherlands guilders 100 Irish pounds 100 Italian lire Danish Kroner Upper limit Lower limit 18.43 390.16 116.32 346.24 1,045.11 0.5620 18.31 373.00 111.20 331.02 999.13 0.4985 The participants in the EMS do not maintain the exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper func t ion ing of the system, the Danish central bank intervenes to smooth out fluctuations in exchange rates. Middle rates for 20 foreign currencies (including the ECU) are quoted daily on the basis of market rates.1 On December 31, 1987 the middle rate for the U.S. dollar was DKr 6.097 per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized exchange dealers may engage in arbitrage, both spot and forward. Spot transactions are defined as transactions where actual delivery takes place w i th in two banking days; transactions that mature in three banking days or more are defined as forward transactions. Spot transactions in all currencies, including Danish kroner, and forward transactions involving purchases of foreign currencies against sales of foreign currencies may be concluded freely with domestic and foreign banks. For- ward transactions involving Danish kroner may also be concluded, but maturities may not exceed three years. Forward premiums and discounts are generally left to the 'Aus tr ian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche ma rk, Greek drachmas, ECUs, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Icelandic kronur, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 174 interplay of market forces. Forward transactions invo lv ing resident and nonresident purchases of foreign currencies against sales of Danish kroner must cover contractual paymen ts, the paymen ts covered being due w i th in three years from the date of the forward contract. There are no restrictions on forward transactions that involve res- ident and nonresident purchases of Danish kroner against sales of foreign currencies, other than the three-year limit on ma tur i ty. Denmark formally accepted the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreemen t, as from May 1, 1967. Exchange Control Territory The Danish Monetary Area comprises Denmark, Greenland, and the Faeroe Islands. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the National Bank and the authorized exchange dealers, that is, most com- mercial banks, some savings banks, some stockbrokers who are members of the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, and some stockbrokerage companies. The exchange reg- ulations generally do not apply to ind iv idual transactions and transfers of DKr 40,000 or less. Transfers of up to DKr 40,000 may, in any even t, be made w i thout delivery of forms. Permission, when required, for foreign direct inves tmen ts in Denmark has to be obtained from the Ministry of Indu s t ry. Licenses for imports and exports, when required, are issued by the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Agr icu l ture, or the M in is try of Fisheries. Prescription of Currency Payments to or from foreign countries may be made in any foreign currency or in Danish kroner. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident Krone Accounts are convertible. The only exceptions are Emigrant Accounts. Krone Accounts may be opened by authorized banks for foreign banks and ins t i tu t ions of the European Com- mun i t ies (EC). They may also be opened for other nonresidents, provided that the total credit balance of the accounts of an ind iv idual nonresident does not exceed DKr 1,000,000. Emigrant Accounts are kept by authorized exchange dealers for holding liquid assets owned by or accruing to Danish emigrants, to the extent that the amounts exceed the exchange allowance of DKr 100,000 available to each person at the time of departure. Certain paymen ts to residents may be made freely from these accounts, and the balances are in any case made convertible one year after departure. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Imports and Import Payments Most commodities, except for textiles, are free of licensing from all sources. For textiles, a common EC system of export-import licenses has now been established for almost all countries exporting low-priced textiles. The only commodities that require a license when originating in or purchased from member countries of the EC are alcoholic beverages and unwrought and semimanufac- tured gold. A few items require a license when originating in Japan, the Republic of Korea, or any other non-state- trading, non-EC country. A larger number of items require a license when originating in or purchased from Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, the Demo- cratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., or Viet Nam. Payments for imports and the related shipping expenses may as a general rule be made freely w i th in five years from the end of the mon th in which the goods were cleared through customs, provided that the terms of payment conform to normal commercial practice in the trade concerned. Repayments of debts must not be made more than 30 days before the day stipulated as the latest in the contract (or before the latest customary date in the trade). However, commercial credits can be repaid at any time if a discount is obtained as a result, provided the payment is made to the supplier and conforms to normal commercial practice in the trade concerned. Prepayments linked to trade in goods and services that are in conformity with normal commercial practice may be granted to nonresidents up to one year prior to the expected date of import or the effected date of performance of the service; the permitted period is up to five years for capital goods (ships, aircraft, heavy machinery, and major installations) when purchased for an amount of DKr 1 million or more. All other advance payments for imports require prior approval by the National Bank. Payments for Invisibles Payments by residents for invisibles may be made freely. Authorized banks are empowered to allow the transfer of funds to an account abroad kept by a person of foreign nationality who has not resided in Denmark for more than seven years, provided that the balance of the account does not exceed DKr 200,000. Foreign ex- change for travel is allocated freely and may be obtained for travel to any country, but not earlier than 30 days before the trip if the amount applied for exceeds the equivalent of DKr 40,000. Travelers may take out freely DKr 40,000 in Danish bank notes and coin, and any amount in foreign bank notes or other means of paymen t. Nonresidents may, in addition, export amounts of up to DKr 50,000 or any such larger amount in Danish kroner and foreign exchange that they can substantiate as having been imported upon entry into Denmark. DENMARK Exports and Export Proceeds Gold is the only commodity that requires a license when exported to member countries of the EC. Except for certain items subject to strategic controls, licenses for exports to other destinations are required only for waste and scrap of certain metals and monetary gold. Export proceeds must be transferred to Denmark with- out undue delay unless the National Bank permits other- wise. However, such amounts collected abroad may be kept in an account with a foreign bank for a maximum period of 30 days; otherwise, foreign exchange receipts must either be offered for sale to the National Bank or to an authorized exchange dealer without undue delay, or kept in an account with an authorized exchange dealer for a maximum period of three months. Nearly all exports of goods and services to the Republic of South Africa and Namibia are prohibited. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange derived from invisibles must be transferred to Denmark, unless the National Bank permits otherwise, and offered for sale to the Bank or to an authorized exchange dealer without undue delay, with exceptions similar to those that apply to export proceeds (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, above). Travelers may bring in any amount of Danish bank notes and coin, foreign bank notes, and other Danish or foreign means of payment. Capital Both inward and outward transfers of capital and all borrowing and lending between residents and nonresi- dents are subject to exchange control and may be re- stricted. The general rules on exchange control issued by the Ministry of Industry are based on EC directives on capital movements and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Capital Code; no distinction is made in these rules between residents of member countries of the EC and those of the rest of the world. Residents have an obligation to repatriate proceeds realized from the sale or liquidation of assets abroad. Transfers abroad may be made by residents to pay interest on, or to redeem upon maturity, or to repurchase any Danish securities. Residents may lend amounts not exceeding DKr 2 million in a calendar year to subsidiary companies (direct investments of loan capital) or, in the case of resident persons, DKr 500,000 in a calendar year to a member of the resident's family. Contributions from a parent enterprise to a branch are treated as direct investment of equity capital. Residents may buy foreign shares as portfolio inves tmen ts, provided that these are listed on the stock exchange or traded in the NASDAQ System (National Association of Securities Dealers Au- tomated Quotations System) in the United States. Resi- dents may only subscribe to or purchase foreign bonds with an original maturity exceeding two years that are listed on a stock exchange. The purchases have to be made through an authorized exchange dealer against cash. 175 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DENMARK The Central Bank applies a liberal procedure to the approval of residents' purchases of unlisted foreign se- curities. Residents may enter into forward transactions and options in securities w i th nonresidents. Actual deliv- ery of the security requires that the buyer is allowed to acquire the security. No special permission is required for residents to make transfers abroad, w i th in certain limits, in connection w i th most direct investments or with private acquisitions of real estate abroad. The limits are DKr 10 million a year for each foreign enterprise for direct inves tmen ts of equ i ty capital.2 Private acquisition of real estate for noncom- mercial purposes and expenses related to building and construction work on such property can be made w i thout limitations. Direct inves tmen ts abroad by residents are normally approved in accordance with Denmark's obli- gations as a member of the EC and the OECD. Au thor ized exchange dealers do not need special permission to grant loans to nonresidents for the financing of paymen ts to residents for purchases of Danish goods and services, provided that the loan is normally granted directly to the foreign purchaser; in those cases where the National Bank's approval is required, this is generally given when the loans are customary in the trade concerned. Permis- sion from the National Bank is required for certain other transfers abroad of a capital nature by residents. Danish emigrants are granted an exchange allowance of up to DKr 100,000 for each person at the time of departure. The remaining liquid assets must be credited to an Emigrant Account in the name of the owner and may be transferred abroad one year after departure, or earlier if the emigrant can show that he has taken up permanent residence abroad with the approval of the relevant foreign authorities. Inward direct inves tment in the form of equ i ty capital may be made without prior license if the inves tment does not increase total direct foreign inves tment in the enter- prise concerned by more than DKr 10 million in each calendar year. However, prior license is always required if the inves tment is undertaken by a foreign firm in which a resident directly or indirectly owns an interest repre- senting a direct investment. Direct investments require notification to the National Bank if they are made w i thout a prior license. A contribution from a parent company to a branch is treated as direct inves tment of equ i ty capital. Other direct inves tmen ts by nonresidents require permis- sion from the exchange control authorities, which is granted liberally in accordance with Denmark's obliga- tions as a member of the EC and the OECD. The purchase by a nonresident of real property in Denmark normally requires a special license from the Ministry of Justice; permission is usually granted readily where real estate is to be used for industrial or similar enterprises. The sale to nonresidents of Danish bonds listed on a stock exchange does not require a special license. Non- residents may freely purchase or subscribe to all types 2A license is requ ired, however, for investments in firms that are engaged exc lus ive ly or largely in cap i tal inv e s tm en ts or financing. 176 of Danish shares, including shares of joint stock and private companies; th ey may also acquire private mort- gage deeds w i th a residual ma tu r i ty of five years or more. Residents may as a general rule take up loans for up to five years from nonres iden ts to finance imports of commodities and services; they may also take up such loans to finance the granting of credits for exports of commodities and services, provided that the credits are in conformity with normal commercial practice and that the ma tur i ty of the loans does not exceed the borrowers' credits to nonresidents in connection with exports of goods and services. Most business enterprises may bor- row abroad w i thout restriction, provided that the maturity is at least one year. Res iden ts may take up loans of up to DKr 500,000 in a calendar year from the borrower's family members. Foreign borrowing by municipalities and public u t i l i ty companies may in certain cases be subject to control by the appropriate department of the Government. Transfers of proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all types of investments and transfers of all other liquid funds in Denmark owned by nonres iden ts, other than new emigrants, are perm i t ted f ree ly, irrespective of when and how the original inves tment was acquired. Interest and repayment of principal on authorized loans, credits, and deposits received from persons and firms who are nonres iden ts at the time of receipt may be paid freely, with the proviso that loans and credits obtained from a nonresident generally must not be amortized or repaid in fu ll more than 30 days before the amortization payment or repayment is due. Inheritances and gifts to relatives may normally be transferred to any coun t ry w i thout limitation. Individual paymen ts above DKr 40,000 as gifts to persons other than relatives are subject to approval from the National Bank. Imports and exports of securities are subject to regu- lation, the details of wh ich are established by the National Bank. Bona fide imports and exports of Danish and foreign securities are permitted. Danish securities held in Denmark and belonging to nonresidents may, in most cases, be sold freely to residents. Foreign securities held in Denmark may be negotiated freely between residents. Authorized foreign exchange dealers' commercial net balances in accounts w i th foreign countries may be negative to the ex tent of an amount equal to the loans that the authorized dealer has granted to residents in foreign currency in conformity w i th the exchange control regulations and, for the purpose of financing Denmark's foreign trade, w i th in a limit of DKr 3 million; for banks and savings banks, the limit is up to 5 percent of net worth (up to 10 percent of net worth allowed under certain conditions). A positive net commercial foreign position is, in principle, allowed only so long as it does not exceed DKr 2 million or, for banks and savings banks, 15 percent of the capital and reserves, whichever is larger. Gold Residents may freely buy, hold, and sell gold coin in Denma rk; they may also import gold coin. Otherwise, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DENMARK residents other than the monetary authorities and au- thorized industrial and dental users are not allowed to acquire gold abroad. Imports and exports of gold normally require licenses issued by the Ministry of Indus try and Commerce; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial and dental users. Imports of gold in bars or coin, unless made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, are subject to value-added tax at a rate of 22 percent; domestic transactions in gold are also taxed at a rate of 22 percent. There is no customs du ty on imports of gold in bars or coin. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 12.

Not for Redistribution DJIBOUTI (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Djibouti is the Djibouti Franc, which is freely convertible into U.S. dollars, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of DF 177.721 = US$1. The buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar are DF 176.84 andDF 179.48, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are set by local banks on the basis of cross rates for the U.S. dollar in inter- national markets. The posted rates are subject to com- mission charges of 1.5-6.0 percent set by the commercial banks, depending on the currency concerned. There is a fixed commission of about DF 500 (or US$3) for transfers in foreign currencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Commercial enterprises are free to negotiate forward exchange con- tracts in respect of commercial and financial transactions through local banks or banks abroad. All transactions are negotiated at free market rates. There are no official schemes for currency swaps or guaranteed exchange rates for external debt servicing. On September 19, 1980 Djibouti formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control There is no exchange control and no prescription of currency. The Djibouti franc is issued in notes and coins by the National Bank of Djibouti, which issues and redeems the currency against U.S. dollars. Deposits in U.S. dollars constitute the cover for the notes issued. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. Otherwise, no prescription of currency require- ments are in force. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Djibouti has a free trade zone in the port of Djibouti, but 1 Deutsche mark, French francs, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs. the territory as a whole does not constitute a free zone. Formally, customs duties are not charged on imports, but in practice, fiscal duties are levied by means of indirect taxes (the general consumption tax). The rate of the general consumption tax is 26 percent for luxury goods and 23 percent for all other goods. A supplementary surtax of 5 percent is levied on the c.i.f. value of imports originating from countries outside the European Com- munities (EC), food, periodicals, and photographic film for noncommercial use. Certain commodities, including alcoholic beverages, noncarbonated mineral water, pe- troleum products, kha t, and tobacco are subject to a surtax at various rates. Additional taxes are levied on imported milk products and fruit juice. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Otherwise, there are virtually no restrictions on exports, w i th the exception of the prohibition on exports of live animals. Export proceeds may be retained. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles No restrictions are imposed on payments for or pro- ceeds from invisibles, except that payments must not be made to or received from Israel and South Africa. A tax of 20 percent applies to salaries paid to individuals who are not residents of Djibouti for professional purposes. Capital No restrictions are imposed on inward or outward capital transfers, but paymen ts may not be made to or received from Israel and South Africa. Under the In- vestment Code of June 5, 1975, enterprises established or expanded to under take certain specific economic ac- tivities are eligible for various tax exemptions. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 178 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DOMINICA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Dominica is the Eastern Caribbean Dollar,1 which is issued by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB). The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at EC$2.70 = US$1. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were EC$2.6949 and EC$2.7084, respectively, per US$1. The ECCB also quotes daily rates for the Canadian dollar and the pound sterling. There is a 1.5 percent tax on sales of foreign exchange for invisible trade transactions involving more than EC$100. Dominica informed the Fund on December 13, 1979 that it formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Finance and applies to all countries outside the ECCB area. The Ministry of Finance has delegated to commercial banks certain of its powers to approve sales of foreign currencies within specified limits. The Ministry of Trade administers import and export arrangements and controls. Prescription of Currency Settlements with residents of territories participating in the ECCB Agreement must be made in Eastern Car- ibbean dollars; those with member countries of the Car- ibbean Common Market (CARicoM)2 must be made in the currency of the CARICOM country concerned. Settlements with residents of other countries may be made in any foreign currency.3 Foreign Currency Accounts Foreign currency accounts may be operated only with the permission of the Ministry of Finance; such permission is normally confined to major exporters and foreign nationals not ordinarily resident in Dominica. The ac- counts can only be credited with foreign currencies obtained outside Dominica. Payments from these ac- counts require no approval, but transactions are subject to the foreign exchange sales tax. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. Most other goods are imported under open general license, but individual licences are required for manufactures or items that compete with regionally available products. 1 The Eastern Caribbean dollar is also the currency of Anguilla, An t igua and Barbuda, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. 2 The CARICOM countries are Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 3 Foreign currencies comprise all currencies other than the Eastern Caribbean dollar. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon presentation to a bank of documentary evidence of pur- chase. Advance payments for imports require prior ap- proval by the Ministry of Finance. Payments for Invisibles All settlements overseas require exchange control ap- proval. However, commercial banks have been delegated authority to sell foreign currency to local residents, as specified below: (1) for incidentals, EC$100, subject to a limit of EC$500 a person a year; (2) for each trip outside the area served by ECCB, EC$3,000, subject to a maxi- mum of two trips in any 12-month period and upon presentation of travel documents; (3) for bona fide busi- ness travelers, EC$1,000 for each day outside Dominica, provided the total does not exceed EC$30,000 in any 12- month period and upon presentation of travel documents; (4) for overseas travel for medical treatment, EC$ 1,000 a day up to a maximum of EC$30,000 in any 12-month period, subject to the presentation of a medical certificate stating that the journey is necessary and upon presentation of travel documents; (5) for educational expenses, in- cluding accommodation, up to EC$15,000 a student in each academic year; and (6) for dependents residing abroad, EC$2,400 in any 12-month period (EC$3,600 for minor or incapacitated dependents). Amounts in excess of specified limits may be obtained with approval from the Ministry of Finance. Specific approval of the Ministry of Finance may also be obtained for outward remittances of cash gifts up to EC$ 1,000 a year to each recipient. Profits may be remitted overseas in full, provided that the Comptroller of Inland Revenue has prior knowledge of the transfer. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited, and specific licenses are required for the export of certain goods to any destination. The conversion of export proceeds to an ECCB currency account is mandatory, except when the exporter has a foreign currency account into which the proceeds may be paid. Exports of bananas are subject to a levy when the export price exceeds a minimum level. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign currency proceeds from transactions in invis- ibles must be sold to a bank or paid into a foreign currency account. There is no restriction on importation of bank notes and coin. Capital All outward transfers of capital or profits require exchange control approval. The purchase by residents of foreign currency securities and of real estate located abroad is not normally permitted. Capital transfers, such as inheritances, to nonresidents require approval, which 179 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DOMINICA normally is granted, subject to the payment of any taxes due. Emigrants leaving Dominica to take up residence outside the ECCB area may transfer up to EC$30,000 per family from their assets, subject to income tax clearance. Direct investment in Dominica by nonresidents may be made with exchange control approval. The remittance of earnings on, and liquidation proceeds from, such invest- ment is permitted, subject to the discharge of any liabilities related to the investment. The approval of the Ministry of Finance is required for nonresidents to borrow in Dominica. Any borrowing abroad by authorized dealers to finance their domestic operations requires the approval of the Ministry. Gold Residents are permitted to acquire and hold gold coins for numismatic purposes only. Small quantities of gold may be imported with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, for industrial purposes only. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments July 27. The 5 percent stamp duty on imports was abolished. July 27. The customs service charges on imports, ranging from 1 percent to 5 percent, were unified at the rate of 1.5 percent. Export and Export Payments July 27. An export levy on bananas was introduced. The levy would be applied when the export price exceeds a specified minimum level. 180 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Dominican Republic is the Domin- ican Peso. All foreign exchange operations, with the ex- ception of those for which the peso counterpart had already been deposited with the Central Bank by Jan- uary 23, 1985 or those that had been otherwise authorized by the Monetary Board as of this date, take place at a unified exchange rate, which is same as the free market rate of the day. On December 31, 1987 the buy ing and selling rates of the Dominican peso in terms of the U.S. dollar, as published by the Central Bank, were RD$4.79 = US$1 and RD$4.88 = US$1, respectively. The Central Bank charges an exchange commission on sale of foreign exchange for merchandise imports equiv- alent to 20 percent of f.o.b. value.1 Proceeds from exports of sugar and mineral products are subject to a surcharge equivalent to the difference between the exchange rate of the day and the exchange rate of RD$4.00 per US$1. Other exchange transactions in U.S. dollars between the Central Bank and other banks carry a commission of l/32 of 1 percent. Commercial banks charge their customers commissions of l/4 of 1 percent (buying) and Vi of 1 percent (selling); an additional commission of 1 percent is levied on payments by letter of credit. Foreign Currency Accounts Under a Monetary Board resolution of August 24, 1982, commercial banks are authorized to open two types of foreign exchange accounts for their clients.2 One of these is a non-interest-bearing U.S. dollar account, from which funds can be drawn to make payments for current trans- actions approved by the Central Bank. The other type of account yields interest at a rate announced periodically by the Central Bank but not more than 1 percentage point below the federal funds rate in the United States; such an account is subject to a m in imum deposit requirement of US$25,000. Both types of account are subject to a 100 percent reserve requirement. Beginning in mid-No- vember 1983, exchange banks have been established, and except for certain temporary restrictions, have been empowered to purchase and sell foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control policy is determined by the Monetary Board, and is administered by the Central Bank. A commission, composed of representatives of the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and the Office of the President, determines priorities for the servicing of public sector external debt. Commercial banks are permitted to 1 Imports of food, fertilizer, petroleum, medicine, and agricultural imports are exempted from this commission. 2 Since the end of 1971, interested natural and juridical persons could be authorized directly by the Monetary Board to open accounts denom- inated in U.S. dollars in the Dominican Repub l ic's banking system. Balances in such accounts could be used freely to make payments abroad. transact freely in foreign exchange. Payments abroad are subject to documentation and limited to transactions via commercial banks. At the end of 1987, there were 16 commercial banks and 90 exchange banks operating in the foreign exchange market in the Dominican Republic. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Imports from the United States that are financed by the U.S. Agency for International Development must be made under special letters of credit. Settlements with Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela may be made through special accounts established under reciprocal credit agreements within the framework of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Import payments in currencies other than the U.S. dollar must be made through letters of credit. Otherwise, no obliga- tions are imposed on importers, exporters, or other residents regarding the currency to be used for payments to or from nonresidents. Imports and Import Payments In principle, all import payments can be made with foreign exchange purchased in the free market. Import settlements against collection or by draft must be denom- inated in U.S. dollars. The importation of automobiles and heavy machinery is prohibited. Most imports are subject to an exchange commission equal to 20 percent of the f.o.b. value. In principle, "nominal duty rates" range from a minimum of 40 percent to nearly 900 percent for imports of malted beverages. Most of the nominal du ty rates at the three- and four-digit level of the tariff schedule range between 40 percent and 75 percent. An internal consumption tax of 20 percent ad valorem and a 4 percent surcharge on the total amount of all customs charges are applied on all imports, subject to the minimum duty of 20 percent, with the exception of agricultural and industrial machinery and inputs for the manufacture of agrochemical products, which are subject to a 5 percent duty. Payments for Invisibles All categories of invisible payments, with the exception of profit remittances and royalty payments, may be made freely through commercial banks, subject to documen- tation requirements. Annual profit remittances cannot exceed the equivalent of 25 percent of the net value of original and additional investment plus reinvestment mi- nus repatriation, duly registered in the Foreign Depart- ment of the Central Bank. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports are temporarily prohibited, including some food products and animal species, unprocessed 181 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DOMINICAN REPUBLIC wood (for environmental protection purposes), and blood (for public health reasons). In addition, products imported under specified bilateral trade agreements are prohibited to be exported under the terms of such agreements. A number of products (such as sugar, molasses, coffee, and cocoa) are subject to prior authorization. Export licenses, issued by the Dominican Center for Export Promotion (CEDOPEX), are required for all products. With specified exceptions, exporters mus t, within two working days of receiving payments, surrender to the Central Bank, through the commercial banks, foreign exchange equal to 100 percent of the value of their exports. For the purposes of exchange surrender, declared export prices must equal or exceed the minimum export prices established by CEDOPEX for certain exports. A mandatory deposit equivalent to 10 percent of the proceeds from exports must be maintained at the Central Bank for 90 days. The deposits bear interest at an annual rate of 12 percent. Firms operating in industrial free zones and ferro-nickel exports are exempted from the exchange surrender re- quirements and are required to convert only the foreign exchange needed by them to cover local costs and taxes. Law No. 69 provides for the issuance of tax credit certificates (certificados de abono tributario—CATs) for a value not exceeding 15 percent of the f.o.b. or c.i.f. value of exports; the percentage can be up to 25 percent when exports contain a high degree of domestic agricul- tural inputs. The CATs are, in principle, fully negotiable and can be used for the payment of taxes or other obligations to the Government. However, only a limited number of CATs have been issued. Law No. 69 also regulates the system of temporary admission for imports, under which duties are waived for any imports used in the manufacture of nontraditional products to be exported within a year. Nontraditional exports are entitled to a refund of a percentage of the import duties paid on raw materials or component parts used in the manufacture of goods sub- sequently exported; the refund is 90 percent on exports containing only imported inputs, 95 percent on exports containing domestic inputs, and 100 percent on exports produced in the industrial free trade zone.3 Exporters are also eligible for a refund of 95 percent of any internal tax levied on locally manufactured goods that are exported. Exporters may not extend credit to foreign buyers for more than 90 days from the date of shipment without authorization by the Central Bank. Proceeds from Invisibles With certain exceptions, such as those relating to tourism and remittances of Dominicans living abroad, foreign exchange proceeds from invisibles must be sur- rendered to the Central Bank through the commercial banks. Proceeds originating in transactions with foreigners 3 Nontraditional exporters who qualify under the temporary import regime of Law No. 69 are also fu l ly exempted from payment of import duties. 182 using international credit cards are also subject to the same surrender requirements as those applicable to ex- ports. The import of Dominican bank notes and coin is prohibited. Capital There are no restrictions on the inward movement of capital by either residents or nonresidents. However, direct foreign investment is regulated by Law No. 861 of July 19, 1978, which created a Directorate of Foreign Investment to approve direct investment requests. Such investments must be registered with the Central Bank. Beginning from May 1984, outward remittances related to investments are made freely through the banks, subject to prior registration with the Central Bank. Foreign debt can be contracted directly by the Central Government, subject to congressional authorization. Ac- cording to Law No. 251 of 1964, new loans by other public and private entities require Monetary Board au- thorization. According to a set of criteria established by the Monetary Board on November 19, 1981, priority in the approval of new loans is given to foreign borrowing for export, import substitution, and social projects such as housing and education. Total financial charges on foreign loans are not allowed to exceed the principal international interest rate by more than 3 percent. There are also minimum maturity requirements according to the type of financing. Since January 23, 1985, the Central Bank has provided foreign exchange for the servicing of public external debt at the market rate; the servicing of private external debt is effected through the market. There are no restrictions on the amount of foreign exchange that Dominican resi- dents can purchase in the free market. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in the Dominican Republic for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary au- thorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, in the Dominican Republic or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 12. The Monetary Board required that foreign sales at the preferential exchange rate of RD$2.96 per U.S. dollar, applicable to certain imports and public sector external debt service, be taken into account in the calculation of the exchange rate applicable to exports. January 19. An exchange commission of 2 percent of the f.o.b. value was imposed on purchases and sales of foreign exchange for merchandise exports and imports, levied on f.o.b. value. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution February 19. The preferential exchange rate of RD$2.96 per US$1 was eliminated. May 30. The exchange commission applicable to sales of foreign exchange for merchandise imports was raised to 5 percent. June 17. The free foreign exchange market was sus- pended, and all foreign exchange was required to be surrendered to the Central Bank at the exchange rate fixed by the Bank. In practice, many foreign exchange transactions continued to take place through the unofficial parallel market and the range of transactions effected through the official market was narrowed over time. November 12. The official and unofficial parallel ex- change markets were unified, with the official rate to be set at the rate prevailing in the parallel market. The exchange commission of 2 percent on purchases of foreign exchange proceeds from merchandise exports was elim- inated, and the commission for sales of foreign exchange for merchandise imports was raised to 20 percent of the f.o.b. value. November 22. An exchange surcharge was imposed on the conversion of receipts from exports of sugar and mineral products. The surcharge is equivalent to the difference between the exchange rate of the day and the exchange rate of RD$4.00 per US$1. Administration of Control January 29. A commission, composed of representa- tives from the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and the Office of the President, was established for the purpose of setting priorities for the servicing of external debt. DOMINICAN REPUBLIC June 17. The authority of commercial and exchange banks to sell foreign exchange (other than to the Central Bank) was suspended. November 12. Commercial and exchange banks were authorized to resume sales of foreign exchange. Imports and Import Payments June 17. Payments for merchandise imports were sub- ject to prior Central Bank approval based on a priority list, under which applications for nonessential imports would not receive foreign exchange or customs certification. November 12. The requirement for prior Central Bank approval of import payments was rescinded. Payments for Invisibles June 17. Limits were placed on the provision of foreign exchange for invisibles and capital, with private debt servicing given low priority. November 12. Unrestricted access to foreign exchange for invisibles and capital transactions was restored. Exports and Export Proceeds November 12. A mandatory deposit requirement was established, under which 10 percent of export proceeds is to be deposited at the Central Bank for 90 days, at an interest rate of 12 percent a year. Proceeds from Invisibles June 17. All proceeds from invisibles were required to be surrendered to the Central Bank through the com- mercial banks. November 12. The surrender requirement for proceeds from invisibles was abolished. 183 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ECUADOR (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Ecuador is the Ecuadoran Sucre. At present, there are three exchange rates: the official rate of S/. 95 per US$1, which is used for the accounting purposes of the Central Bank of Ecuador on ly; the intervention market rate of the Central Bank; and the free market rate. On August 11, 1986 the decision was taken to transfer private sector transactions to the free market and to adjust the intervention rate of the Central Bank regularly, so as to limit the spread between the two rates. On December 31, 1987 the exchange rate averaged S/. 221.50 per US$1 in the intervention market of the Central Bank, and S/. 247.36 per US$1 in the free market. Beginning August 12, 1986 the Central Bank is autho- rized to purchase the foreign exchange proceeds relating to the following transactions in the intervention market: exports of crude oil and petroleum products; interest earned on international reserves; all public sector income in foreign currency, including foreign loan disbursements; foreign exchange balances (when positive) on public sector deposits in foreign currency at the Central Bank; passenger airport taxes; and all other transactions of the Central Bank. From the same date, the Central Bank is authorized to sell foreign exchange relating to paymen ts of the following operations in the intervention market: imports and purchases of services abroad by the public sector; interest payments and principal amortization in foreign currency of the public sector; transfer of surpluses of foreign oil companies operating in Ecuador; and all other transactions of the Central Bank. All foreign exchange receipts from exports for which permits were granted before August 12, 1986 are allowed to be sold, on a transitional basis, in the intervention market of the Central Bank. Also, on a transitional basis, the following payments are allowed to be made in the intervention market: imports for which permits were granted before August 12, 1986; servicing of the private sector external debt for which the foreign exchange was sold to the Central Bank prior to August 12, 1986; profit remittances accruing from foreign inves tmen ts for which the foreign currency was sold to the Central Bank before August 12, 1986; and expenses incurred abroad by stu- dents and handicapped persons for which a contract was approved by the Central Bank prior to August 12, 1986. On August 27, 1986 a regulation of the Monetary Board postponed, for two-year renewable periods, payment of the difference between the exchange rate of S/. 110 and the rate of the U.S. dollar or its equivalent in other foreign currencies quoted at the time of payment for purposes of payment of installments by importers whose permits had been granted before August 12, 1986. This line of credit is intermediated through the commercial banks. 184 Arrangements for forward exchange transactions were established as of November 19, 1987. Under these ar- rangements, the Central Bank may periodically issue non- interest-bearing bonds denominated in U.S. dollars to qualified importers with List I import permits. The Central Bank determines the amounts, maturities, spreads in exchange rates, and other conditions it considers appro- priate. Interested importers must submit their bids to the Central Bank in closed envelopes indicating the amount of foreign exchange and the exchange rate at which they are willing to purchase these bonds. Importers must deposit at the Central Bank a partial countervalue in sucres when their bid is accepted, with the balance due at the ma tur i ty of the bond. Most borrowings abroad are subject to an exchange tax ranging from 0.5 percent to 2 percent. Ecuador formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, with effect from August 31, 1970. Prescription of Currency Most settlements with the German Democratic Repub- lic, Hungary, and Poland take place through bilateral accounts. Payments between Ecuador and Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, U ruguay, and Venezuela must be made w i th in the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Exchange proceeds from other countries must be received in convertible currencies. Whenever possible, import payments must be made in the currency stipulated in the import license. Imports and Import Payments Permitted imports are divided into two categories: List I, consisting of priority goods (Group I "Special"), essential goods (Group A), and semi-essential goods (Group B); and List II, consisting of less essential and luxu ry goods. All goods not included in these two lists are prohibited. Mainly for reasons of industrial protection, certain imports require prior authorization from govern- ment ministries or agencies, although in the course of 1986 and 1987 th is requ irement was eliminated for a considerable number of imports. With specified exceptions, prior import licenses are required for all permitted imports. Books, newspapers, periodicals, and printed music may be imported w i th or w i thout prior import licenses; private sector transactions are effected w i thout limitation through the free private market at the rate obtained on that marke t. These imports are subject to payment of the applicable taxes and charges regardless of the ir purpose. Medicines and spare parts for machinery and auto- motive vehicles are free of license when valued at US$500 f.o.b. or less, but all applicable charges and taxes must ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution be paid on them. In addition, the State Petroleum Cor- poration may import supplies, materials, and equ ipment necessary for the conduct of its business dur ing emergency situations w i thout obtaining a prior import license. A few goods may be imported only from member countries of the LAIA, and some on ly from Paraguay. W i th these exceptions, import licenses are issued freely irrespective of the origin of goods, provided tha t: the appropriate import taxes (including import surcharges) have been paid; prior ministerial authorization (where applicable) has been obtained; and a cer t if ica te is subm i t ted showing that insurance has been arranged in Ecuador. All mer- chandise imports may be inspected by international agen- cies prior to shipping to ensure conformance w i th the import perm i t. Upon arrival of the merchand ise, the importer must settle up to 20 percent of total f .o .b. value in cash for imports for wh ich the Central Bank has provided foreign currency. All private sector imports are subject to a tax of 10 percent levied on commercial transactions. Further- more, all public sector imports are subject to a service charge of 1 percent of the c.i.f. value. With certain exemptions, imports on List II are subject to an import surcharge of 30 percent ad valorem. In January 1987, a system of allowing du ty-free imports of inpu ts used in export production was expanded. On October 21, 1987, a prior import deposit scheme was introduced, requiring private sector importers to lodge at the Central Bank a non-interest-bearing 90-day deposit in domestic currency. The rate of deposit is 50 percent for goods on List I, Group A (essential goods, consisting of capital equ ipmen t, inputs for agriculture and indus t ry, and consumer goods w i th no local sub s t i tu te s) and Group B (semi-essential goods, consisting of goods with some local equ iva len t, except luxu ry goods), and 80 percent for goods on List II ( luxu ry items). Essential goods (List I, Special) are exempt from the deposit requirement. Payments for Invisibles Only public sector payments for invisibles are handled in the intervention market, including interest on public debt. Other payments for current invisibles must be settled in the free market and are unrestricted. There are no limitations on the amounts of domestic and foreign bank notes that travelers may take out. The arrangement for the refinancing of private external debt involves d ifferent implicit exchange rates arising from the imposition of charges on the official rate to compensate for possible exchange losses. These rates are applicable to the refi- nancing of private external credits contracted or endorsed by the domestic financial system or/3irectly by the private sector,* and to payment of interest on loan proceeds sold to the Central Bank before refinancing or sold in the same way at any time if under Resolution No. 1202, or those sold at the free market beginning from July 1, 1982 up to a day prior to short- or long-term financing. With respect to foreign loans to petroleum companies, interest, com- missions, and other financial charges on foreign loans ECUADOR may not exceed the equivalent of 2 percent above the interest rates in the creditor country, and annual amor- tization may not exceed the sum of undistributed profits, depreciation of fixed assets and liquidated assets, and any variation in working capital. Residents traveling abroad by air must pay a tax of S/. 2,900 for each exit visa. Airline tickets for foreign travel are taxed at 10 percent, and tickets for travel by ship are subject to tax at the rate of 8 percent for departure from Ecuador and 4 percent for the return trip. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require licenses; licenses are issued freely, subject to guarantee. All private sector export proceeds must be sold in the free market not later than: (1) 15 days from the date of shipment for exports against cash paymen t, exports of bananas, coffee beans, cacao beans, prawns in any marketable form, and other unprocessed seafood products; (2) 60 days from the date of each shipment for perishable products appearing on the lists issued by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Integra- t ion, and Fisheries, or the Ministry of Agriculture and Stockbreeding, provided it is shown that the sale was made on an installment basis or on consignment; (3) 30 days from the date of shipment for the remaining primary products, provided it is shown that the sale was made on an installment basis; and (4) 120 days from the date of shipment for products not mentioned above, provided it is shown that the sale was made on an installment basis. However, the Central Bank may extend these periods. The surrender requirement does not apply to exports effected under authorized barter transactions; however, barter transactions require a prior contract. M in imum reference prices are established for exports of bananas, coffee, fish products, cacao, and semifinished products of cacao to help ensure that exchange proceeds are fully surrendered. Payment of foreign exchange for petroleum exports will be made on the basis of the sale prices stated in the sale contracts. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be sold in the free market, except for interest income on foreign reserves of the Central Bank, invisible receipts of the public sector, and proceeds from the passenger airport tax, which are transacted at the intervention rate. Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign or domestic bank notes. Capital Capital may freely enter or leave the country through the free market. Most borrowings abroad are subject to an exchange tax ranging from 0.5 percent to 2 percent (see section on Exchange Arrangement, above). All foreign direct inves tment in Ecuador must be registered with the Central Bank. New investment re- quires the prior authorization of the Ministry of Indus try, Commerce, Integration, and Fisheries. For foreign capital entering Ecuador in the form of machinery and equipment, the investor must show that the merchandise has been 185 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ECUADOR cleared through customs and that it took the form of a "nonreimbursable" import. Additionally, investors must present to the Central Bank certification from the appro- priate ministry that the declared value conforms to the actual value of the machinery and equipment. The De- partment of Credit and Foreign Investment of the Central Bank of Ecuador must submit a recommendation to the General Management of the Central Bank within 30 days from receipt of the request for registration and all pertinent documentation. Thereafter, the General Management of the Central Bank must approve or deny the request for registration for foreign exchange purposes within an additional 30 days, taking into account the interests of the Ecuadoran economy and priorities established in the country's development plans. In certain cases, where all documentation has been submitted, the Central Bank can provisionally register the investment for a period of up to 90 days. Similarly, loans granted to the Government or to official entities involving the disbursement of foreign exchange must be registered for foreign exchange purposes with the Exchange Department of the Central Bank; for all other foreign loans, registration is mandatory for statistical purposes. In the case of short-term suppliers' credits, no special registration procedure is required. Foreign na- tionals are prohibited from owning rural properties and from owning or operating mining industries w i th in 30 miles of Ecuador's coastline or borders. The Ministry of Indus t ry, Commerce, Integration, and Fisheries does not authorize direct foreign investment for the purpose of establishing publicity firms, commercial broadcasting sta- tions, television stations, newspapers, or magazines. Since August 11, 1986, repatriations of capital and remittances of profits on foreign inves tmen ts have been handled through the free exchange market in respect of those investments that have been effected through this market. There are no time limits on the remittance of profits. The limit on the repatriation of profit remittances is 30 percent a year, or 40 percent for firms that export at least 40 percent of their production. There are no limits on repatriation of capital for the tourism sector and for enterprises exporting more than 80 percent of their production. Gold Residents other than the Central Bank may export gold only in the form of filigree work, the gold content of which does not represent more than 25 percent of its market value. Imports of monetary gold are reserved for the Central Bank. The import du ty on gold in bars is 10 percent of the c.i.f. value, while the du ty on semi- worked gold is 40 percent ad valorem; semiworked gold is treated as a List II import. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement November 19. Forward foreign exchange arrangements were introduced, under which the Central Bank may periodically issue non-interest-bearing bonds denomi- 186 nated in U.S. dollars to importers of List I import permits (essential and semi-essential goods). These importers must submit their offers to the Central Bank in sealed envelopes indicating the amount of foreign exchange and the exchange rate at which they are willing to purchase the bonds. Importers must deposit at the Central Bank a partial countervalue in sucres at the time of acceptance of their offers, with the balance due at the maturity of the bond. Imports and Import Payments January 14. Imports of additional inpu ts used for export production were allowed du ty free. February 5. The number of prohibited items and items for which prior authorizations are required was reduced. June 11. Quantitative restrictions on imports, mainly covering agricultural products, were lifted. October 21. A prior import deposit scheme was intro- duced, under which private sector importers were re- quired to lodge a non-interest-bearing 90-day deposit in domestic currency at the Central Bank in an amount equivalent to 50 percent of the c.i.f. value of imports included under List I, Group A (essential goods, consisting of capital goods, inpu ts for agriculture and indus t ry, and consumer goods with no local subs t i tu tes) and Group B (semi-essential goods, consisting of products with some local equ iva len t, except luxu ry goods). The rate of deposit is 80 percent for the c.i.f. value of imports under List II ( luxury items). Essential imports of so-called priority goods (included under List I, Special, such as pharma- ceuticals) are exempt from the deposit requirement. Exports and Export Proceeds May 13. The periods for the surrender of export proceeds by the private sector to the free market were shortened. Capital February 9. The procedure for the Central Bank's debt- equity swaps was modified. July 29. The regulations governing foreign participation in direct investment were amended as follows: (1) 49 percent in banks, financial and insurance companies, and in certain commercial sectors; (2) no limits or prior authorization requirements for agro-industry, agriculture, and manufacturing, while mining and fishing are to be governed by their own specific laws; and (3) prohibition in communications, internal transport, public services, advertising, and in sectors adequately served by domestic enterprises. The establishment of branches of foreign enterprises would be authorized subject to the require- ment of a m in imum operating capital of S/. 50 million. August 13. The Central Bank's debt-equity swap scheme was temporarily suspended. September 3. Foreign enterprises operating in Ecuador will have to obtain authorization from the Ministry of Indus try, Commerce, Integration, and Fisheries for par- ticipation in domestic companies if their share exceeds 10 percent of capital. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EGYPT (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Egypt is the Egyptian Pound, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at LE 1 = US$1.42857. The established buying and selling rates of the Central Bank of Egypt for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1987 were LE 0.700 and LE 0.707, respec- tively, per US$1. Established rates for 16 other convertible currencies are based on cross rates for these currencies quoted in New York.1 The established central bank rate applies, on the re- ceipts side, to proceeds from: (1) exports of petroleum, rice, and cotton; (2) Suez Canal dues; and (3) SUMED pipeline royalties. The established central bank rate ap- plies, on the payments side, to: (1) settlements for imports of certain essential foods tuffs, insecticides, and fertilizers; and (2) specified capital transactions. All external debt- service payments are effected at the established rate, with the exception of suppliers' credits for imports of capital goods by the public sector, which are effected at the commercial bank pool rate. Some special exchange rates are also in effect. At the end of December 1987 a rate of LE 0.70 = £ 1 applied to visible and invisible trade transactions within the framework of the bilateral payments agreement with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and a rate of LE 2.0 = £ 1 applied to those visible trade transactions effected under the bilateral payments agreement with the U.S.S.R. A rate of LE 0.98 = US$1 applied to transac- tions effected under the bilateral payments agreement with Sudan. In addition, a rate of LE 0.3913 = US$1 is used for liquidation of accounts related to past bilateral paymen ts agreements. A rate of LE 0.84 = US$1 applies to transfers by foreign aviation companies relating to operations transacted until December 18, 1985. The commercial bank pool rate applies to transactions that take place through the commercial bank pool. On May 11, 1987 about 40 percent of transactions that were effected through this pool were transferred to the new bank market (see below), and almost all the remaining transactions were transferred on November 18, 1987. The commercial bank pool rate is now applied to a very limited number of transactions, but continues to be used for customs valuation purposes. Beginning June 1, 1987, the commercial bank pool rate was changed on several occasions, and on December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were LE 1.87 and LE 1.88 per US$1, respectively. A new exchange market (the new bank market) was introduced, starting May 11, 1987. All commercial banks 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kuwaiti dinars, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. authorized to carry business in both foreign and domestic currency (38 banks) and two travel agencies were per- mitted to operate in this market. The exchange rate in the market is set by a committee of eight members (four representatives of the public sector banks, two from the joint-venture banks, and two from the private sector banks). Two observers, one from the Central Bank of Egypt and one from the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade, attend the meetings of the committee. The com- mittee meets at the end of each business day to fix the rate, which is binding for all transactions effected in the market the following business day. Cross rates are estab- lished on the basis of the London exchange market rates. In setting the rates, the committee uses four indicators (supply, demand, working balances of the banks, and assessment of general market trends). The rate was set at LE 2.165 = US$1 on May 11, 1987. Since then, it has fluctuated between LE 2.160 and LE 2.225 per US$1, and on December 31, 1987 it stood at LE 2.200 = US$1. The selling rate is set by the addition of 1A percent to the buying rate set by the committee, with half of this difference (V% percent) accruing to an account of the Central Bank. The authorized banks may buy and sell foreign exchange among themselves at the exchange rate determined by the committee plus an additional Vie percent. The Central Bank has determined maximum operating balances in foreign exchange for each authorized bank. Any excess over this amount has to be sold twice a week to a special account in the name of the Central Bank at the rate set the day the operation takes place plus Vie percent. The Central Bank has also set a limit on banks' negative operating balances on which it will cover any exchange loss resulting from a depreciation of the rate (the limit is set at 6 percent of each bank's foreign currency deposits). Each bank authorized to operate in the new market was required to swap a minimum of 3 percent of its foreign currency deposits outstanding as of Decem- ber 31, 1986 with the Central Bank in return for Egyptian pounds for a renewable period of three months at the exchange rate prevailing in the new market. The Egyptian pound equivalent is re-evaluated at the time of settlement every three months, with the difference made up in Egyptian pounds according to the exchange rate of the day of settlement. Interest is not paid on the U.S. dollars nor on the Egyptian pounds. On May 11, 1987 the following transactions were authorized in the new bank market. On the receipts side: (1) workers' remittances; (2) tourism receipts; (3) bank purchases from all types of foreign exchange accounts and foreign bank notes or other means of payment; (4) retained private sector export receipts; (5) surrendered private sector export receipts of live goats and sheep, molasses, and fish; and (6) specified public sector export receipts. On the payments side: (1) specified public sector 187 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EGYPT visible and invisible payments within the limits established by the foreign exchange budget; (2) some private sector invisible paymen ts (but excluding debt service paymen ts ), according to current regulations;2 (3) private sector im- ports, including those of Law 43 companies; and (4) settlements of letters of credit opened by the private sector prior to May 11, 1987, provided that documents are negotiated after this date. Beginning June 1, 1987, foreign exchange grants from the U.S. aid program have been converted at the new bank market rate. Beginning September 15, 1987, companies covered by Law 43 (joint ventures) were permitted to remit profits abroad through the new bank market, provided they do not have own exchange in their capital and working accounts. Also, public and private sector payments (vis- ible and invisible) authorized through the new bank market may not be effected through the market until the balance in the export retention accounts has been used up. On November 18, 1987 almost all transactions still effected through the commercial bank pool were transferred to the new bank market. These included, on the receipts side: (1) commissions and bank interest paymen ts; (2) profits of Egyptian companies and banks; (3) proceeds surrendered to authorized banks by the private sector from exports of peanuts, fresh onions, fresh garlic, po- tatoes, and citrus fru i ts; (4) export proceeds of public sector companies in respect of flax, watermelon, fru i ts, and vegetables; (5) export proceeds of public sector companies in the chemical and food production sectors; and (6) export proceeds of public sector companies within the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Information, such as books, films, and television programs. On the payments side, additional import payments by the public sector were transferred to the new market, and they are effected at the new bank market rate. Private sector payments not authorized through the new bank market may be effected through free accounts held with domestic banks ("own exchange") at a rate agreed among the parties. These payments include some invisibles and servicing of foreign currency loans obtained through local banks. With the introduction of the new bank market in May 1987, the scope of the informal market has decreased significantly. Administration of Control A foreign exchange budget for public sector exchange transactions is established annually. Banks are authorized to execute foreign exchange transactions, through the commercial bank pool or through the new bank market, within the framework of a general authorization, w i thout the need to obtain specific exchange control approval. The Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade supervises imports and exports by the public sector. Certain imports 2 Effec t ive February 11, 1988, the commercial banks have been autho- rized to use a portion of foreign exchange resources to settle pr iva te debt service obligations due after th is date. Priority is given to se t t lemen ts of private debt obligations related to imports, and the Central Bank deter- mines the max imum foreign exchange allocations for each commercial bank. 188 and exports are reserved for public sector entities. Port Said City is accorded the status of a free zone. Arrears are maintained w i th respect to external paymen ts. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries with which Egypt does not have bilateral paymen ts agreements may be made in any convertible currency, in Egyptian pounds, or in a convertible currency to the debit or credit of the appro- priate Free Account (see section on Nonresident Ac- coun ts, below), or in any other manner prescribed or permitted by the foreign exchange regulations. However, the proceeds from raw cotton exports during the Septem- ber 1987-August 1988 season to all countries must be received in U.S. dollars. Settlements with countries with which Egypt has bi- lateral payments agreements are made according to the terms of these agreements.3 However, payments to such countries for imports and various other purposes not covered by these agreements may be made in convertible currency. Certain settlements with countries with which indemnity agreements concerning compensation for na- tionalized property are in force are made through special accounts in Egyptian pounds with the Central Bank of Egypt. Suez Canal dues are expressed in SDKs and may be paid by debiting Canal Dues Accounts, Advance Payment Canal Dues Accounts, or Free Accounts in Foreign Currency. Canal Dues Accounts must be opened in foreign currency, and balances are transferable abroad. Nonresident Accounts In addition to the special accounts related to Egypt's bilateral paymen ts agreements or to the indemnity agree- men ts concluded w i th certain countries and Canal Dues Accoun ts, there are three types of accounts: Free Ac- counts, D Accounts, and Nonconvertible Capital Accounts. Free Accounts may be opened in the name of any entity other than the Egyptian Governmen t, public authorities, and public sector entities. They may be opened either in foreign currency or Egyptian pounds; the latter are freely convertible. Free Accounts in foreign currency may be credited with transfers of convertible currencies from abroad, transfers from other similar accounts, foreign bank notes registered in a customs declaration form, and with the equivalent in foreign currencies from funds transferred from a free account in Egyptian pounds and interest earned on these accounts. These accounts may be debited for transfers abroad, transfers to other similar accounts, withdrawals in foreign bank notes to the owner or others, transfers to free accounts in Egyptian pounds, and for any payment in Egypt, including those for exports and for bank charges and commissions. Free Accounts in Egyptian pounds may be credited with the equivalent in Egyptian pounds for transfers from abroad in convertible currencies or from a free account 3 At the end of December 31, 1987 Egypt maintained operative bilateral paymen ts agreements w i th the Democratic People's Repub l ic of Korea, Sudan, and the U .S .S .R. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution in foreign currency; with transfers from similar accounts; with proceeds of sale to an authorized bank of foreign currencies registered in a customs declaration fo rm; and with proceeds of sale of bank ins trumen ts and interest on these accounts. These accounts may be debited for the equivalent in Egyptian pounds for transfers abroad in convertible currencies, transfers to other free accounts in foreign currency or transfers to similar accounts, funds withdrawn in foreign bank notes on behalf of the owner of the account or others, and f u n ds used to meet local expenditures of the settlements of the value of export goods. D Accounts may be opened in the name of any resident of a country w i th which Egypt has a bilateral paymen ts agreement. The accounts must be designated by the name of the partner country concerned. These accounts may be credited with receipts under the respective paymen ts agreement and with the equivalent of transfers authorized from the country of the account holder. They may be debited for transfers to the country of the account holder and for local paymen ts (including those for Egyptian exports) authorized by the imp lemen t ing regulations and within the scope of the relevant payments agreement. N(inconvertible Capital Accounts may be credited with any payment of a capital nature to a foreigner living outside Egypt that is not remittable under the exchange control regulations. Banks may debit these accounts for charges legally due from the account holder. Accounts held by individuals may be debited up to a limit of LE 10,000 a year for use by the account holder. Accounts held by juridical persons may be debited for settlement of outstanding obligations to the Egyptian authorities; they may also be used for paymen ts to residents for services rendered up to a limit of LE 20,000 a year for expenses incurred in connection w i th the activities or residence of the holder's employees in Egypt. Resident Accounts In addition to Free Accounts, which may be opened by both nonresidents and residents, residents may hold Foreign Exchange Retention Accounts, Import Accounts in Foreign Exchange, and Capital and Working Accounts. Foreign Exchange Retention Accounts may be opened in the name of authorized recipients and credited with the proceeds from certain exports of goods and invisible receipts. Public sector companies may use these funds for their purposes w i th in the allocations of the foreign exchange budget, transfer them to other public sector companies within the same sector, or sell them to the authorized banks. Private sector exporters may debit these accounts for visible and invisible payments related to their economic activity or sell the exchange in the new bank market, but may not transfer these funds to free accounts. Holders of private sector export retention accounts are en t i t led —w i thout the need to submit any documentation —to use up to 25 percent of the proceeds of their exports for the financing of travel expenses for the exporter or his employees, for other invisible pay- ments related to the account holder's activity, and for EGYPT settling of repatriation requirements. Banks are allowed to pay interest on the balances in retention accounts. Unused balances in retention accounts owned by the public sector, unless exempted, must be sold periodically to the banking system at the new bank market rate. If the balances in the retention accounts owned by the public sector entities originate from invisible proceeds, unutilized balances must be surrendered mon th ly. In addition, balances in these accounts must be fully utilized by the account holder before authorized transactions can be effected by the public or private sector through the new bank market. Import Accounts in Foreign Exchange may be opened by authorized banks in the name of Egyptian nationals. These accounts may be credited with transfers in con- vertible currencies, transfers from free accounts in foreign exchange or in Egyptian pounds, transfers from another import account in foreign exchange, the equivalent in free currency of any amount of foreign exchange deposited by clients (regardless of the means and the source), and w i th bank interest. They may be debited for the financing of imports of the private sector on behalf of the account holder or others, transfers abroad to cover invisible transactions related to the activity of the account holder, settlements of obligations related to import transactions effected on behalf of the private sector, and to cover in the form of foreign bank notes and other acceptable means of payment the expenditures of the account holder or others abroad within the limit of US$500 (or its equivalent) a calendar year, provided that the amount drawn is registered on the user's passport and travel ticket. Withdrawal in cash is permitted without any limit. Capital and Working Accounts may be opened by companies covered by Law 43 (joint ventures). These accounts may be credited with transfers from abroad or transfers from other similar accounts, and may be debited with payments by the account holder (e.g., imports, profit remittances, interest payments, other invisible paymen ts, and financing of local expenditures) or with transfers to other similar accounts. Holders of these accounts are not permitted to use the new bank market resources before their balances in these accounts are fully utilized. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. A Su- preme Council for the Planning of Foreign Trade is entrusted with formulation of a long-term policy for exports and imports, control of the annual export and import plan, and supervision of the execution of the foreign exchange budget. Most imports from payments agreement countries (except those made under the own- exchange arrangement), as well as imports of specified goods from any source, are reserved for the public sector. Certain private trade with payments agreement countries is not restricted. Imports by the central government, public authorities, and public sector companies are effected within the provisions of the foreign exchange budget through the Central Bank pool, the commercial bank pool, and the 189 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EGYPT new bank market. Private sector imports are effected through the new bank market. For purposes of adminis- tration, the economy is divided into several sectors (agriculture, industry, transportation, etc.). The annual foreign exchange budget provides for a specific quota for each sector, and the authorities in charge of each sector decide on the goods to be imported and the entities that are to import them within that quota. All imports financed by the Central Bank are effected at the established rate, with the exception of capital goods imports under sup- pliers' credits, which are effected at the commercial pool rate, and imports under bilateral payments agreements, which are effected at a special, more appreciated rate (except for imports from the U.S.S.R., see above). Beginning May 11, 1987, imports by the private sector have taken place through the new bank market or through the own-exchange system. There is a negative list of 210 items, with all commodities not included on the prohibited list being freely imported. Certain goods (e.g., imports financed with bilateral and multilateral assistance, com- ponents imported by licensed local manufacturers and assembly units, and free zone imports) are exempted from the negative list, and the items on the negative list may be imported with the approval of the Ministry of Economy. Before a letter of credit is opened, private sector importers (including companies covered by Law 43) must lodge with an authorized commercial bank a 35 percent prior import deposit in domestic or foreign currency. These deposits have to be financed from the importers own resources. Importers are required to cover 100 percent of a letter of credit when it is opened. Banks are allowed to finance all or part of the remaining 65 percent. When suppliers' credit facilities are available, the importer is not required to cover 100 percent of the letter of credit. Goods may not be shipped before a letter of credit is opened, except for imports of spare parts needed for machinery and equipment for production activities financed through the use of balances in export retention accounts, provided that the importer pledges to present certification that, within two mon ths, the parts were used or installed in accordance with the relevant regulations. Payments for Invisibles Banks are authorized to provide foreign exchange through the new bank market for most invisible payments by the public sector, within the framework of the foreign exchange budget and in accordance with current rules and regulations, provided that the public sector entities concerned have used up the balances of their retention accounts. Other invisible payments by the private sector are also financed through the new bank market (e.g., authorized pilgrimage and medical treatment abroad, specified payments for emigrants, etc.). Egyptian nation- als are entitled to retain their earnings in foreign exchange in free accounts and may use this foreign exchange freely for invisible payments abroad. They may also acquire additional foreign exchange through the medium of free 190 accounts (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above). Profit remittances by companies covered by Law 43 are authorized through the new bank market, provided funds in capital and working accounts are used up first. Only Egyptian nationals and foreigners who have lived in the country for a continuous period of five years can purchase airline tickets under certain conditions (one- way or round trip originating in Egypt) in Egyptian pounds. With this exception, all others must purchase tickets with convertible currencies or with Egyptian pounds converted at the new bank market exchange rate. Travelers may not export more than LE 20 in Egyptian bank notes. Egyptian travelers may take with them any foreign exchange that they have acquired legitimately; foreign travelers leaving Egypt may reconvert their re- maining Egyptian pounds after deducting US$30 for each night spent in Egypt, provided that evidence is produced that Egyptian pounds were obtained at the new bank market exchange rate. Exports and Export Proceeds Apart from exports to South Africa, which are prohib- ited, and commodities required for the national economy that may be restricted, exports may be made without license. Exports of many products are organized and supervised by foreign trade committees. Cotton, rice, and petroleum are exported by the public sector only, and their proceeds must be repatriated w i th in three months. Proceeds from exports of books, newspapers, and other publications must be repatriated as soon as they are received and in any case w i th in a period not exceeding five years from the date of sh ipmen t. Proceeds from all other exports must be repatriated w i th in one year from the date of shipment. Proceeds from exports of petroleum, cotton, and rice have to be sold to the Central Bank. Proceeds from exports may be fu l ly retained in foreign exchange retention accounts w i th the exception of petro- leum, cotton, and rice. In addition, only 50 percent of the proceeds from exports of peanuts, onions, garlic, potatoes, citrus, live goats and sheep, fish, and molasses may be retained. Proceeds from exports by both private and public sectors to bilateral paymen ts agreement coun- tries are obtained in Egyptian pounds, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant agreement. All departing foreigners who are carrying on their person gifts valued at more than LE 250 are required to show evidence that foreign exchange equivalent to the excess value has been exchanged at an authorized bank at the new bank market exchange rate. The corresponding limit on excess value applied to Egyptian nationals is LE 100, and that for purchases left behind with Khan El Khalil merchants is LE 500 (provided that they are exported w i th in three mon ths from the date of the trav- eler's departure and that proof is provided that he visited Egypt). Proceeds from Invisibles Earnings abroad by persons and juridical entities other than the Egyptian Governmen t, public authorities, and ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution public sector entities may be held abroad or retained indefinitely in Free Accounts. Receipts from tourism must be surrendered to the banking system at the new bank rate. However, privately owned hotels are allowed to retain 25 percent of their foreign exchange earnings. Hotels operating under In- ves tment Law 43 are allowed to retain all of their foreign exchange earnings. Travel agencies belonging to the private sector are allowed to retain 10 percent of their foreign exchange earnings, and 100 percent if they operate under Inves tment Law 43. Public sector hotels are allowed to retain only 10 percent of their foreign exchange pro- ceeds, and Misr Travel (a public sector agency) is allowed to retain 25 percent. Other invisible earnings by public sector entities may be retained to the extent of 10 percent of the total; authorization to retain more or exemption from periodic surrender requirements must be approved by the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade. Certain travel in Egypt by foreigners may be financed from various special accounts, such as those under indemn i ty agreements with certain countries. Persons arriving in Egypt from abroad may import up to LE 20 in Egyptian bank notes and are permitted to bring in, and to use locally, unlimited amounts in foreign exchange; a customs declaration is required if the traveler wishes to re-export foreign currency. Capital There are no restrictions on the use or transfer of balances on free accounts maintained in banks operating in Egypt. With this exception, outward capital transfers are restricted. Egyptian emigrants are authorized to trans- fer abroad funds up to LE 900 a person or LE 3,500 a family, and to export other personal effects and fu rn i tu re up to LE 200 a person or LE 500 a family. Transactions in Egyptian and foreign securities abroad relating to the purchase and selling of these securities must be carried out through authorized banks, provided that the funds used for this purpose represent free foreign exchange. Brokers registered on the stock exchanges of Cairo and Alexandria are authorized to intermediate in the transfer of ownership of securities, whe ther at home or abroad, and to undertake the local collection or payment in foreign currency of the value of the securities. Foreign, jo in t-ven ture, and private sector banks are re- quired to deposit 15 percent of their foreign currency deposits with the Central Bank. In addition, banks au- thorized to operate in the new bank market are required to swap with the Central Bank a m in imum of 3 percent of their foreign currency deposits outstanding as of December 31, 1986 in return for Egyption pounds, for a renewable period of three months at the exchange rate prevailing in the new bank market. No interest is paid on this operation. Transfers of accrued alimony are permitted in accord- ance with court orders. Foreigners leaving Egypt per- manently after a period of residence of at least five years are permitted to transfer abroad the equivalent of EGYPT LE 5,000 in foreign currencies through authorized banks, irrespective of whether this sum represents capital assets owned by or income accrued to the foreign national. Amoun ts exceeding this sum are deposited in a Noncon- vertible Capital Account. Law No. 43 of June 19, 1974 (amended by Law No. 32 of June 9, 1977), concerning the investment of Arab and Foreign Funds and the Free Zones, defines the treatment of new foreign investments. Requests for trans- fers of profits not covered by this law are considered on an individual basis. Gold Banks are not authorized to deal or speculate (for their own or their customers' account) in precious metals. The import of precious metals and stones for industrial and local market requirements is subject to regulations. The export of gold and silver fabrics may be permitted, provided that the sales proceeds are repatriated in con- vertible currencies. Travelers are permitted to take out and bring in their gold jewelry within specified limits. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement May 5. The sterling clearing pound rate used in bilateral transactions with the U.S.S.R. was changed from LE0 .70 = £ 1 t o LE 1.35 = £ 1. May 5. Authorized banks were required to swap with the Central Bank a minimum of 3 percent of their foreign exchange deposits (outstanding as of December 31, 1986) in exchange for domestic currency, for a renewable period of three months at the exchange rate prevailing in the new bank market. The amounts are to be paid in U.S. dollars. The swap must be repeated at the end of every quarter, with the domestic currency equivalent revalued at the time of settlement every three months. Any differ- ence is to be made up in domestic currency according to the exchange rate on the day of the settlement. Interest will not be paid on this operation. May 6. The excess of foreign exchange acquired by a bank over its authorized operating capital in foreign exchange is to be sold to the Central Bank at the prevailing exchange rate on the day the operation takes place plus V(cid:6) percent. May 10. A new bank foreign exchange market was established. Banks operating in Egypt and permitted to undertake transactions in domestic and foreign currency were permitted to buy and sell foreign exchange for their own account in this market. The market would be ad- ministered by a committee composed of eight represen- tatives of the authorized banks and two observers (a representative of the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade and the Central Bank of Egypt). The daily buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar are announced by the committee, with the rates for other foreign currencies determined according to their relation to the U.S. dollar on the London market on the basis of the closing prices of the same day. The committee meets daily after the close of transactions for the day. The exchange rates in 191 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EGYPT this market apply only to specified receipts and payments. The selling rate is set by adding 1 percent to the buying rate set by the committee, with half of the difference 0/2 percent) going to the bank undertaking the operation and the other half going to a profits account held by the Central Bank of Egypt. The authorized banks may buy and sell foreign exchange among themselves on the basis of an addition of V* percent to the buying rate. The Central Bank establishes for each bank a ceiling on its operating capital in foreign exchange, and the banks are required to sell any amount in excess of the operating capital to an account held by the Central Bank at the end of a specified period of time, with the excess sold at the buying price plus Vs percent. The balance on this account may be used in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Economy and the Central Bank. May 10. It was announced that foreign exchange re- ceipts transferred from the commercial bank pool to the new bank market would include workers' remittances; tourism receipts; bank purchases from foreign exchange accounts and of foreign currencies and other means of paymen t; retained private sector export receipts; surren- dered private sector export receipts from exports of live goats and sheep and molasses; and specified public sector export receipts. Foreign exchange payments transferred to the new bank market would include specified public sector visible and invisible payments within the limits established in the foreign exchange budget; and specified private sector invisible payments (subject to regulations in most cases). All private sector imports were also authorized through the new bank market. May 12. The difference between the buying and selling rates in transactions in the new bank market was set at VA percent. One half of this difference (Vs percent) would accrue to a profit account at the Central Bank of Egypt. Payments to this account are to be made at the end of each week. The other half would accrue to the bank carrying out the operation. Foreign exchange operations among the authorized banks would be carried out at the exchange rate prevailing on the day of the operation plus !/i6 percent. May 14. The Central Bank of Egypt will cover exchange losses resulting from short positions in foreign exchange up to 6 percent of deposits in foreign currency held as of December 31, 1986. May 24. Companies covered by Law 43 (joint ventures) were permitted to obtain foreign exchange in the new bank market under the same conditions and in accordance with the same decrees that regulate the transactions of the private sector in this market, including the requirement that they must lodge a prior import deposit of at least 35 percent in Egyptian pounds or foreign currency at the time they apply for a letter of credit. June 9. Foreign exchange obtained in the new bank market was allowed to be used to settle payments due on uncovered credit balances that were opened prior to May 11, 1987, with respect to importation of goods by the private sector. It would apply to all bills of lading as of June 9, 1987. 192 August 2. Foreign exchange obtained in the new bank market was allowed to be used for the financing of bills of lading for credits that were opened prior to May 11, 1987 and had not been settled by the importer as of that date, irrespective of whether or not the bills of lading were predated or postdated as of June 9, 1987. September 15. When quotas are implemented as allo- cated in the foreign exchange budget for importation of goods or for invisible paymen ts of government agencies, public authorities, and public sector un i ts, they must be financed first with balances in the export retention ac- counts of the entities. Payments cannot be financed with the Central Bank pool, the commercial bank pool, or the new bank market un t il the balances in all retention accounts have been fu l ly utilized. Payments by the private sector (both visible and invisible) cannot be financed by resources from the new bank market until the balance in the retention accounts held by the requesting party has been fu l ly utilized. With regard to payments by companies covered by Law 43, balances in the capital and working accounts have to be exhausted before any foreign ex- change can be obtained through the new bank market. November 17. Additional receipts and payments were transferred from the commercial bank pool to the new bank market. Transactions transferred included, on the receipts side: (1) commissions and bank interest pay- men ts; (2) profits of Egyptian companies and banks; (3) proceeds surrendered to authorized banks by the private sector from exports of peanuts, fresh onions, fresh garlic, potatoes, and citrus fru i ts; (4) export proceeds of public sector companies in respect of flax, watermelon, fruits, and vegetables; (5) export proceeds of public sector companies in the chemical and food production sectors; and (6) export proceeds of public sector companies within the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Information, such as books, films, and television programs. On the payments side, additional imports payments by the public sector were transferred to the new market, and they are effected at the new bank market rate. December 6. The sterling clearing pound rate used in bilateral transactions with the U.S.S.R. was changed from LE 1.35 = £ 1 to LE 2.0 = £ 1. December 20. The Central Bank rate does not apply to foreign exchange transferred to cover local expenditure and related expenses of oil exploration and drilling com- panies' subcontractors. Nonresident Accounts May 5. Authorized banks' transactions with money dealers and correspondents abroad were restricted by permitting only drawings from and not deposits into their accounts in domestic currencies. Also, no new accounts were allowed to be opened by these individuals. Resident Accounts June 9. Foreign Exchange Retention Accounts opened in the name of individuals or private sector units may be used to cover visible and invisible paymen ts related to the account holder's activity or the exchange may be sold ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution in the new bank market. Balances on these accounts may not be transferred to free accounts. August 18. Use of up to 25 percent of the balances on the export retention accounts opened in the name of private sector exporters as of this date, and of the same percentage of export proceeds credited to these accounts, was allowed to finance the following: (1) travel expenses of the exporter or his employees that are related to export activity; (2) invisible payments related to the account holder's activity, such as consultants' fees, agents' com- missions, and other specified invisibles; and (3) settlement of repatriation requirements. September 15 It was clarified that the use of up to 25 percent of balances in the export retention accounts for travel expenses, invisible payments, and settlement of repatriation requirements would be allowed in accord- ance with the existing foreign exchange regulations with- out prior approval. September 15. Use of balances in export retention accounts was approved for importation through direct release from customs of spare parts needed for machinery and equipment for production activities without letters of credit, provided that the importer pledges to submit certification, within two months, to the government agency that had licensed the production activities that the parts were used or installed in accordance with the relevant regulations. Imports and Import Payments May 10. The prior import deposit requirement (in foreign exchange) for the private sector was eliminated. A private sector importer, when financing a letter of credit with his own foreign exchange or with suppliers' credit facilities, was required to deposit at least 35 percent EGYPT of the value of the letter of credit in foreign exchange at the time he submits the request. The remainder must be paid in full in foreign exchange or in accordance with the conditions of the suppliers' credits when the letter of credit is opened. Goods may not be shipped before a letter of credit is opened. Authorized banks were prohib- ited from financing the 35 percent portion of the deposit, but they may be allowed to finance the 65 percent portion. May 11. Private sector importers were permitted to lodge the 35 percent of prior import deposits as well as the remaining 65 percent in Egyptian pounds, whether or not the letter of credit is financed with cash or through suppliers' credits. Payments for Invisibles August 20. The requirement that US$150 per person must be converted at the commercial bank pool rate by nonresidents when entering the country was abolished. September 15. Companies covered by Law 43 were permitted to remit profits through the new bank market, provided that the applications are submitted to the au- thorized bank where the applicant's accounts are held and they are in accordance with the regulations on profit remittances. To have access to the foreign exchange from the new bank market, the applicant must have exhausted balances of foreign exchange on his capital or investment accounts. Applications to an authorized bank other than the one where he holds his foreign exchange accounts, must be accompanied by a statement from his bank that no funds are left on his accounts. Proceeds from Invisibles June 1. It was announced that grant receipts from the U.S. aid program were to be converted at the new bank market rate for both the private and public sectors. 193 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EL SALVADOR (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of El Salvador is the Salvadoran Colon. The Salvadoran colon is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at C 5.00 = US$1. The rates of the Central Reserve Bank for transactions with the public are C 5.000 buying and C 5.075 selling, per US$1. Official market transactions by commercial banks with the public take place within these limits. Buying and selling rates in the official market for other currencies are based on the daily quotations for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. Foreign exchange held in approved foreign currency deposit accounts may also be sold to specified registered manufacturers/importers by specified exporters directly at a rate which may deviate from the official exchange rate. A stamp tax of 0.1 percent is applicable to all sales of exchange; on amounts below C 100,000 the tax is levied at fixed amounts that may slightly exceed 0.1 percent. On November 6, 1946 El Salvador notified the Fund that it was prepared to formally accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Subject to the general directives issued by the Monetary Board, exchange control authority is exercised by the Central Reserve Bank through its Exchange Control Department. Prior authorization by the Exchange Control Department of the Central Reserve Bank is required for all imports in excess of US$300 and for many invisible payments and capital transactions. Exports of a number of commodities require licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy, subject to agreement by the Ministry of Agriculture. Since January 30, 1980, exports of two major commodities have been under government supervision; exports of sugar are governed by the National Sugar Institute (!NAZUCAR), and those of coffee are governed by the National Coffee Institute (INCAFE). Most of the exchange proceeds from all exports have been centralized at the Central Reserve Bank. The Central Reserve Bank allocates foreign exchange to the commer- cial banks through the Fondo Operative under which each commercial bank is assigned a maximum foreign exchange operating balance. Commercial banks are re- quired to report daily to the Central Reserve Bank all credits and debits to the Fondo, and each week foreign exchange holdings in excess of the assigned limit are transferred to the Central Bank, while deficiencies may be covered by the Central Bank. In turn, the commercial banks are required to provide foreign exchange to the private sector in accordance w i th the following list of priorities: (1) basic foods, medicines, raw materials for the production of medicines, and oil products; (2) raw materials and other intermediate goods needed for pro- 194 duction, including machinery, equipment, and replace- ment parts; (3) payments for medical expenses abroad, foreign s tudy, travel, and pensions; (4) debt service; and (5) all other goods, services, transfers, and movements of capital. Arrears are maintained with respect to certain external commercial payments of the private sector. Prescription of Currency On August 20, 1986 a new paymen ts mechanism called the Derecho de Importation Centroamericana (DICA) was approved in principle to settle trade transactions with other countries of Central America.1 The DICAs are U.S. dollar-denominated, non-interest-bearing, negotiable, trans- ferable obligations of the central bank of an importing country, payable in its local currency within a period of 18 months. The issue of DICAs of an importer by the central bank is subject to the acceptance of the exporter. Prior to maturity, DICAs can be freely negotiated between exporters and importers in the region at mutually agreed prices, which can differ from the original nominal value of the DICA; at ma tur i ty, the DICAs have to be liquidated at the official exchange rate (or average of official ex- change rates in case of multiple exchange rates) by the issuing central bank, which will bear the exchange risk arising from any difference between the date of issue and date of liquidation. Certain DICAs can be liquidated prior to maturity; this occurs when a DICA issued by the central bank of a given country and already used for payment of imports from another country is presented for liquidation by an exporter of the same country that originally issued the DICA. Payments to Mexico are settled through a clearing house. Otherwise, residents are free to make authorized payments in any currency they choose. Nonresident Accounts Accredited diplomatic missions and other foreign in- stitutions and nonresidents in El Salvador may hold nonresident accounts in foreign currency with authorized banks, provided that such accounts are credited with foreign exchange received from abroad. Banks may also freely open foreign currency accounts, for any period of time and in any amoun t, in the names of individuals (whether of foreign or Salvadoran nationality) who reside abroad and, for a maximum period of six mon ths, in the names of foreign persons residing in El Salvador for less than six months. All nonresident accounts may be utilized freely, but the commercial banks must make periodic reports to the Central Reserve Bank of the movements of such accounts. 1 This payment mechanism became operational in El Salvador in early 1987. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts Foreign currency deposit accounts may be opened by exporters of nontraditional goods and services, manufac- turing enterprises buy ing U.S. dollars from the exporters to pay for their imported inpu ts, as well as staff of embassies, consulates, and international organizations. The accounts may be opened in U.S. dollars or in any other approved foreign currency; transactions can be effected only in the currency in which an account is opened. Accounts may be in the form of a demand or time deposit and are subject to a reserve requirement of 10 percent. The banks must place the funds thus deposited in investments abroad, provided that the ma tur i ty of investments does not exceed 30 days for demand deposits, and provided that the maturity of inve s tmen ts from time deposits is the same as the maturity of the time deposit. The banks are required to pay interest on the time deposit at rates of up to 2 percent below LIBOR. Transfers of funds between individual holders of foreign currency deposit accounts are prohibited. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are issued by the M in is try of Economy and are required for only a few items, including airplanes, firearms, ammun i t ion, military equ ipmen t, dynam i te, cot- ton for industrial use, ju te sacks, skins, leather, some chemical and pharmaceutical products, coffee for seeding, sugar, and saccharin. Permits for private sector imports that exceed the equivalent of US$300 need to be autho- rized by the Exchange Control Department of the Central Reserve Bank. The allocation of foreign exchange for import paymen ts is made according to a set of priority lists. Top priority is assigned to imports of basic food, medicines, raw materials for production of medicines, and oil imports. Second priority is given to imports of raw materials and capital goods for agricultural and industrial production. Import items of low priority are divided into two lists: (1) a prohibited list of imports of luxu ry items from outside Central America, and (2) a list of nonessential goods imports from outside Central America that are subject to a prior deposit requirement equivalent to 100 percent of the import value. In addition, imports of inpu ts for manufacturing may be financed with deposits in foreign exchange accounts acquired directly from exporters of nontraditional goods and services. Imports from the rest of Central America can be financed by sight drafts, letters of credit, direct paymen ts, or the regional clearing arrangement. Imports from outside Central America that can be financed through sight drafts (cobranzas} are limited to US$10,000. Imports from out- side Central America in excess of US$10,000 can only be made by means of 90-day letters of credit. However, in practice, the Central Reserve Bank also sets limits on the total value of letters of credit each bank can open. A 20 percent guarantee deposit is required to open a letter of credit with the commercial banks. In addition, the com- mercial banks require a deposit in domestic currency EL SALVADOR equivalent to at least 20 percent of the import value from importers when opening letters of credit. Public sector import payments are made by the External Department of the Central Reserve Bank. The External Department handles all official bilateral lines of credit, and lines of credit for Industrial Reactivation funded by the Inter-American Development Bank. Imports from countries outside the Central American Common Market (CACM) that apply discriminatory re- strictions against exports from El Salvador must be paid for before customs clearance, with the exception of industrial raw materials, which may be paid for within three years. Also, medicines from Mexico may be paid for within 90 days; this applies also to imports of spare parts from Mexico by importers who are regarded as small enterprises. Imports of many nonessential goods are subject to a selective consumption tax at rates ranging between 10 percent and 125 percent. Most goods of Central American origin are exempt. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles of a personal nature (i.e., medical trea tmen t, study abroad, and foreign travel) are subject to the following limits: (1) up to US$5,000 a year to meet expenses for medical treatment (additional amounts can be authorized in exceptional cases subject to verifi- cation) and a guarantee deposit equivalent to 50 percent of the foreign exchange to be placed with the Central Reserve Bank; (2) up to US$8,000 per year for educational expenses, plus US$400 per month for living expenses; and (3) up to US$1,500 per year (or US$75 per day for a max imum of 20 days) for nonbusiness trips to countries in Central America (US$700 per year per child under 16 years), up to US$1,875 per year (or US$125 per day for a maximum of 15 days) for nonbusiness trips to countries outside Central America (US$900 per year per child under 16 years), and up to a maximum of US$150 per day for business trips, subject to the approval of the Central Bank. A guarantee deposit of 20 percent of the foreign exchange request in excess of US$400 is required by the commercial banks for travel outside of Central America. For residents traveling outside of Central America, the branch of Banco Hipotecario (a mortgage bank) at the international airport is authorized to sell foreign exchange up to US$800 (on the basis of US$125 per day), without a guarantee deposit, if a traveler can verify that he is still w i th in the applicable annual limits for travel. The authority to grant foreign exchange for expenses relating to foreign travel and study abroad is delegated to the commercial banks. In the case of private remittances, the Central Reserve Bank can authorize pension payments to retired Salvadoran diplomats living abroad with more than ten years of government service. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are not required except for certain foodstuffs and other items for which the authorities wish to ensure an adequate local supply. An export registration 195 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EL SALVADOR certificate from the Central Reserve Bank is required for all exports exceeding US$200. Export proceeds from coffee, sugar, and cotton must be surrendered directly to the Central Reserve Bank. In addition, all other export proceeds in excess of US$10,000 received through the commercial banks must be surren- dered to the Central Reserve Bank within one working day. The collection term for export payments normally must not exceed 90 days, but longer credit terms may be authorized by the Exchange Control Department. The Central Reserve Bank gives "prompt proceeds surrender bonds" to exporters of nontraditional goods and services who sell their proceeds within 180 days of receipt. The face value of these bonds, which is equivalent to net of financial charges which the Central Reserve Bank pays on short-term loans, may be freely negotiated and can be used as a warranty for banking credits to cover advanced deposits for imports or to make settlements on credits contracted with Central Bank resources. Exports of coffee, sugar, and shrimp are subject to an export tax. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange receipts from invisibles must be surren- dered to the Central Reserve Bank or an authorized commercial bank. Embassies, consulates, and offices of international organizations in El Salvador and the ir em- ployees are allowed to deposit their exchange receipts in the special foreign currency accounts in their names for purposes of meeting their foreign exchange requ iremen ts. Travelers may bring in(£200 in domestic notes and coins; this limit is, however, subject to modification to facilitate border trade with other Central American countries. Capital All exchange receipts resulting from capital transactions must be surrendered to the monetary authorities, including direct and indirect foreign inves tmen t. The entry of capital with a maturity in excess of one year in the form of foreign investment must be registered with the Ministry of Economy. Registration ensures (1) free remittance of net profits on foreign capital invested in industrial enter- prises, enterprises engaged in the extraction of nonre- newable natural resources, and tourist enterprises; (2) remittance of net profits of enterprises engaged in other activities up to a limit of 10 percent a year of the registered capital (larger amounts may be authorized in special cases by the Ministry of Economy); (3) repatriation of the proceeds from the total or partial liquidation of the enterprises (after payment of taxes) in proportion to the participation of foreign capital in the total capital; (4) remittance of the sales proceeds of shares and other instruments representing investments or participations, 196 including capital gains; and (5) payment of interest and amortization as determined at the time of registration. In the cases under (3) and (4), in addition to the approval of the Exchange Control Department, the prior approval of the Ministry of Economy is required. Payments abroad representing capital movements re- quire exchange licenses; such licenses are not granted for resident-owned capital. Prior approval by the Ex- change Control Department is required for outward re- mittances of interest and amortization on external loans. Foreign loans w i th a maturity of up to one year must be authorized by the Central Reserve Bank; foreign loans w i th a ma tur i ty of more than one year must be authorized by the M in is try of Economy. The Central Reserve Bank is authorized to set ceilings on the utilization of foreign credit by the commercial banks and the mortgage bank. Decree No. 279 of March 27, 1969 sets certain m in imum capital requ iremen ts for businesses that are owned by foreign nationals and for those in wh ich foreign nationals have a shareholding interest. For purposes of this decree, foreign nationals are defined as persons who are not citizens of one of the five CACM member countries. Gold Gold coins in denominations of (£25, C50, C100, and C200 have been issued as legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in El Salvador for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewe lry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Reserve Bank; such licenses are granted for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. In practice, imports of nonmonetary unworked gold are made only by jewelers' cooperatives acting on behalf of their members and other users for dental purposes. Changes During 1987 Prescription of Currency February I and July I. El Salvador signed an agreement with Guatemala and Honduras, respec t ive ly, establishing the Derecho de Importation Centroamericana (DICA). Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts June 10. Exporters of non trad i t ional goods and services (including exporters to the rest of the Central American region) were permitted to open U.S. dollar accounts and to sell any amount from these accounts that are not used for their own import paymen ts to registered importers/ manufac turers directly at an exchange rate that may d iffer from the official exchange rate. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EQUATORIAL GUINEA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Equatorial Guinea is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transactions in French francs between the BEAC and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1, free of commission. Buy ing and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market. A commission of 0.50 percent is levied on transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except transfers in respect of central and local government operations, payments for imports covered by a duly issued license domiciled w i th a bank, scheduled repayments on loans properly obtained abroad, travel allowances paid by the Government and its agencies for official missions, and payments of reinsurance premiums. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, Equatorial Guinea's exchange control measures generally do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely, but all financial transfers in excess of CFAF 500,000 to countries of the French Franc Area must be declared to the authorities for statistical purposes. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate General of Exchange Control (ONCC) in the Ministry of Finance. Exchange transactions relating to all countries must be effected through authorized intermediaries —that is, authorized banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Indus try. Prescription of Currency As Equatorial Guinea is an Operations Account coun- try, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. 1 The CFA franc circulating in Equatorial Guinea is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Congo, and Gabon. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The principal nonres- ident accounts are Foreign Accounts in Francs. BEAC bank notes received by the foreign correspondents of authorized banks and mailed to the BEAC agency in Equatorial Guinea by the Bank of France or the Banque Centrale des Etats de TAfrique de TOuest (BCEAO) may be credited freely to Foreign Accounts in Francs. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. All other imports in excess of CFAF 50,000 in value are subject to license, but licenses are issued freely. All import transactions must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 50,000. Import transactions by residents involving goods for use outside Equatorial Guinea must be domiciled with a bank in the country of final destination. Settlements for imports effected under an import license benefit from the autho- rization of uninterrupted transfer given to the authorized banks by the Ministry of Finance. Payments for Invisibles Payments in excess of CFAF 500,000 for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries require prior declaration but are per- mitted freely; those to other countries are subject to the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Payments for invis- ibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresi- dents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. For tourist travel, residents traveling to coun- tries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a person a year; any foreign exchange remaining after return to Equatorial Guinea must be surrendered. For business travel, the corresponding allocation is the equivalent of CFAF 15,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 450,000 a trip. Of that amount, CFAF 150,000 may be bills. Travelers must present certificates of their activity and permission from their enterprise to travel. Additional allocations may be allowed. The transfer of rent from real property owned in Equatorial Guinea by foreign nationals is permitted up to a limit equivalent to 50 percent of the income declared for taxation purposes, net of tax. Remittances for current repair and management of real property abroad are to be limited to the equivalent of CFAF 200,000 every two or three years. The amount of transfer of the salary of a foreigner working in Equatorial Guinea will be permitted 197 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EQUATORIAL GUINEA upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher as well as justification of expenses, provided that the transfer takes place within a month of the pay period concerned. Except in the case of foreigners working in Equatorial Guinea temporarily, payments of insurance premiums to foreign countries up to CFAF 50,000 are permitted; larger amounts may be authorized by the ONCC. Resident and nonresident travelers to countries outside the French Franc Area may take out up to CFAF 20,000 in BEAC bank notes. Travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may, subject to prior declaration, take out any amount in BEAC bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out bank notes and coin up to the amount declared by them on entry, or up to CFAF 50,000 if no declaration was made. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Export transactions valued at CFAF 50,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Exports to all coun- tries are subject to domiciliation requirements for the appropriate documents. Proceeds from exports to all countries must be repatriated within 30 days of the payment date stipulated in the sales contract. Payments for exports must be made within 30 days from the arrival date of the merchandise at its destination. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected within a month of the due date and surrendered within a month of collection if received in foreign cur- rency. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Capital Capital movements between Equatorial Guinea and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control. Capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted free ly .2 Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold jewelry in Equatorial Guinea. The approval of the Direc- torate of Mines is required to hold gold in any other form. Such approval is not normally given, as there are no industrial users in Equatorial Guinea. Newly mined gold must be declared to the Directorate of Mines, which authorizes either its exportation or its sale to domestic industrial users. Exports are only allowed to France. Imports and exports of gold require prior authorization by the Directorate of Mines and the Minister of Finance, which is seldom granted for imports. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 2 Regulations on capital transactions, such as the sale of foreign securities in Equatorial Guinea or direct inves tmen ts, have been prepared and are pending approval. The authorities are also in the process of drafting legislation aimed at stimulating foreign inves tment in the agri- cultural, forestry, construction, public works, mining, and industrial equ ipment maintenance sectors. 198 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ETHIOPIA (Position on December 37, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Ethiopia is the Ethiopian Birr, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at the official rate of Br 2.07 = US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are also officially posted; daily quotations by the National Bank of Ethiopia (the central bank) are set on the basis of the official rate for the U.S. dollar and the previous day's closing rate of the currency concerned against the U.S. dollar in London. The National Bank does not deal with the public; its transactions in U.S. dollars with the authorized dealers take place at the official rate. Authorized dealers must observe the official rate for the U.S. dollar and prescribed commission charges, which accrue to the National Bank, of 0.50 percent buying and 1.50 percent selling; in addition, they are authorized, but not obliged, to levy service charges for their own account of up to 0.25 percent buying and 0.75 percent selling and, for currencies other than the U.S. dollar, to include the margin charges applied by the correspondents abroad. In practice, the authorized charges are usually levied. These commissions are applied also to the National Bank's dealings with the Government and certain public sector entities. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized dealers require the approval of the National Bank to undertake forward exchange transactions. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk operating in the official or the commercial banking sectors. Administration of Control All transactions in foreign exchange must be carried out through authorized dealers under the control of the National Bank. All payments abroad require licenses issued by the Exchange Controller, whose office is a department of the National Bank. All exports are licensed by the Exchange Controller to ensure the surrender of the foreign exchange proceeds, and shipments require permits issued by that office. The Minister of Foreign Trade has statutory authority to prohibit, restrict, or regulate imports and exports. Prescription of Currency Outgoing payments are normally made in convertible foreign exchange appropriate to the country of the recip- ient or in U.S. dollars. The net proceeds of exports must be received in a foreign currency that is freely convertible, or in any other acceptable foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may, subject to exchange control ap- proval, open nonresident accounts either in birr or in foreign currencies at authorized banks. Deposits to these accounts can only be made in foreign exchange. Balances on nonresident foreign currency accounts may be freely transferred abroad. Transfers between nonresident ac- counts do not require prior approval. Members of the diplomatic community must use transferable or nontrans- ferable birr accounts for payments of local expenses. No resident Ethiopian national may maintain a bank account abroad. A joint venture may be permitted to open foreign currency, transferable or nontransferable, birr accounts for the purchase of raw materials, equipment, and spare parts not available in the local market. As soon as the goods are received, documentary evidence of entry of the goods purchased with such funds must be submitted to the Exchange Control Division. In general, the accounts may only be replenished after such documents have been presented. Blocked accounts of nonresidents are maintained with authorized banks and are used to retain funds in excess of Br 20,000 arising from disinvestments in Ethiopia (see section on Capital, below). Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited, and all imports from other sources require a license. Payments abroad for imports require exchange licenses, which are obtainable upon presentation of a valid importer's license. Approval of applications for exchange licenses is condi- tional upon the provision of satisfactory information on costs and payment terms and the submission of evidence that adequate insurance has been arranged with the Ethiopian Insurance Corporation, particularly for goods imported under letters of credit. Foreign exchange is not made available for a specified range of imported goods (including alcoholic beverages and certain durable con- sumer goods) considered to be nonessential or readily substitutable by domestic products. Imports of cars and other vehicles require prior authorization by the Minister of Transport. Exchange licenses are granted in the cur- rency appropriate to the country of origin, or in any convertible currency that may be requested. Payments by letter of credit, mail transfer, telegraphic transfer, or cash against documents at sight are all normally accept- able, but the National Bank must be consulted regarding imports on a cash against documents basis. Certain imports (about 100 items, mostly consumer goods) may not be financed on an acceptance basis, and virtually no imports take place on this basis. Importation on suppliers' credits requires prior approval of the terms and conditions of the credit, and such imports are limited to raw and intermediate materials, Pharmaceuticals, and machinery and transport equipment. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require exchange licenses. In- visibles connected with trade transactions are treated on the same basis as the goods to which they relate. Foreign 199 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ETHIOPIA ETHIOPIA employees may remit monthly up to 30 percent of their net earnings (but only for the first three years of their contract if employed by the private sector); they may remit a maximum ranging between 40 percent and 50 percent of total net earnings during the period of service and upon final departure. Other expatriate employees may on final departure take out the same maximum amount, but not more than Br 20,000 in any one year. Foreign nationals who are not entitled to remittance facilities may, however, remit up to 30 percent of their net earnings for the education of their children. Persons traveling abroad are allowed foreign exchange equivalent to Br 125 a day for a maximum period of 20 days in any one calendar year if the journey is made for business purposes; for tourism, persons 18 years of age or over are allowed up to the equivalent of Br 600 a year. Students are allowed foreign exchange up to the equivalent of Br 500 for study abroad, and Ethiopian nationals having dependents pursuing higher studies in accredited insti- tutions abroad are allowed to remit funds to meet school fees and reasonable expenses. Residents may remit pre- miums on insurance policies taken out before April 1962. Subject to certain limits and to submission of evidence, persons may obtain foreign exchange allocation for med- ical treatment and travel abroad of up to Br 10,000. After providing for payment of local taxes, foreign companies may, in principle, remit dividends on their invested and reinvested capital in any currency. Travelers may take with them a maximum of Br 10 in Ethiopian bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of most cereals to any destination other than Djibouti also are prohibited. All commodity exports require permits from the Exchange Controller and some require, in addition, the approval of specified public bodies. When applying for a permit, an exporter must specify the goods to be exported, the destination, and the value. For exports on a c.i.f. basis, exporters must obtain full insurance from the Ethiopian Insurance Corporation. The granting of a permit by the Exchange Controller enables the goods to pass through customs. The licensing system is used to ensure that foreign exchange receipts are surrendered to the Na- tional Bank, generally within three months, and that export proceeds are received in an appropriate currency (see section on Prescription of Currency, above). Exports of hides and skins are regulated and exports are prohibited until the needs of local factories have been met. Capital Controls over capital movements are designed to re- strict outflows, to preclude an unwarranted accumulation of external debt, and to keep the authorities informed of the country's external debt position. All receipts of capital in the form of foreign exchange must be surrendered. Exchange control authorization is required, and registration of capital inflows with the exchange control authorities establishes evidence of re- ceipt, which is required for repatriation. All recognized and registered foreign investments may be terminated on presentation of documents regarding liquidation and pay- ment of all taxes and other liabilities. Subject to appro- priate documentation, foreign businessmen having non- registered investments may transfer their capital abroad on liquidation and final departure from Ethiopia, but may not transfer more than Br 20,000 in any one calendar year; funds in excess of this amount must be deposited in a blocked account with an authorized bank. (This regulation does not apply to joint ventures established under the new foreign investment code.) Transfers by emigrants who had operated their own businesses are restricted to Br 20,000 in any one calendar year. Joint ventures are permitted between the Ethiopian public sector and foreign investors, with up to 49 percent foreign ownership, except in the precious metals, public utilities, telecommunications, banking and insurance, transport, and domestic trade sectors. All applications for joint ventures must be approved by the Office of the National Committee for Central Planning and registered with the Domestic Trade Ministry; a minimum of 25 percent of share capital is required to be paid before registration. Exemptions from income taxes are granted for up to five years for new projects, and for up to three years for extensions to existing projects. Imports of investment goods and spare parts for such ventures are also eligible for exemptions from customs duties and other specified import levies. Such ventures must be limited to 25 years in duration, but could be extended beyond this limit with the approval of the Council of Ministers. Borrowing abroad requires exchange control approval and is restricted. Authorized banks may freely place their funds abroad, except on fixed-term deposit, but they may not acquire securities denominated in foreign currency without the permission of the National Bank. In addition, they need the prior approval of the National Bank to overdraw their accounts with foreign correspondents, to borrow funds abroad, or to accept deposits in foreign currency. Proceeds from Invisibles Gold Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered. Travelers may bring in Br 10 in Ethiopian currency. Foreign exchange must be declared by travelers on entry, and its re-export is subject to authorization, except for temporary visitors. Reconversion of birr must be supported by documentary evidence of prior exchange of foreign currency. The ownership of personal jewelry of which gold or platinum forms a part is permitted. Unless specifically authorized by the Minister of Mines, Energy, and Water Resources, the possession or custody of 50 ounces or more of raw or refined gold or platinum, or of gold or platinum in the form of nuggets, ores, or bullion, is not permitted. Newly mined gold is sold by the Ethiopian 200 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Mineral Resources Development Corporation to the Na- tional Bank. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require exchange licenses issued by the National Bank. Such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. Changes During 1987 Exports and Export Proceeds September 12. Exports of hides and skins were con- trolled, and exports would not be permitted until the needs of local factories have been fully met. ETHIOPIA 201 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FIJI (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Fiji is the Fiji Dollar, the value of which is determined on the basis of the fixed relationship between the Fiji dollar and a weighted basket of currencies of Fiji's most important trading partners. The exchange rate of the Fiji dollar in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily on the basis of quotations for the U.S. dollar and other currencies in- cluded in the basket. On December 31, 1987 the midpoint exchange rate for the Fiji dollar in terms of the U.S. dollar was F$ 1.4405 per US$1. The Reserve Bank of Fiji provides official quotations only for the U.S. dollar. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Fiji formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from August 4, 1972. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank of Fiji, acting as agent of the Government; the Reserve Bank delegates to authorized dealers the authority to approve normal import payments. Except with the specific permission of the Reserve Bank, residents of Fiji are required to offer for sale to an authorized dealer all foreign currencies they receive.1 The Ministry of Economic De- velopment is responsible for the issue of import licenses, with the exception of those for gold, timber, rice, and dairy products. Import licenses for gold are issued by the Ministry of Finance, for timber by the Ministry of For- estry, and for rice and dairy products by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Export licenses are issued by the Comptroller of Customs. Prescription of Currency Transactions with all countries are subject to exchange control. Settlements with residents of any country may be made in Fiji currency through an External Account or in any foreign currency. Payments for exports to any destination outside Fiji may be made in Fiji currency from an External Account or in any foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts A nonresident2 may maintain an External Account in Fiji currency or a Foreign Currency Account with an authorized bank; such accounts may be opened without the specific approval of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. These accounts may be credited freely with interest payable on 1 Under Fiji's Exchange Control Regulations, foreign currencies are all currencies other than the Fiji dollar. 2 A nonresident is a person or firm whose country of normal domicile or established residence is a country other than Fiji. As regards individuals, a resident of Fiji is a person who either has lived or in tends to continue living in Fiji for at least three years. 202 the account, with payments from other External Ac- counts, with the proceeds of sale of foreign currency or foreign coin by the account holder, and with Fiji currency notes which the account holder brought into Fiji or acquired by debit to an External Account or by the sale of foreign currency in the country during a temporary visit. External Accounts also may be credited with pay- ments by residents for which either a general or a specific authority has been given. External Accounts may be debited for payments to residents of Fiji, transfers to other External Accounts, payments in cash in Fiji, and purchases of foreign exchange. Imports and Import Payments Imports of most goods are under open general license, although imports of a range of specified goods, including tea, mild steel bars, steel shelving and racking, tubes and pipes of iron or steel, cement, certain foodstuffs, alcoholic beverages, kerosene stoves, safety matches, seed pota- toes, poly vinyl chloride (PVC) pipes, PVC-insulated elec- tric wires and wiring pin clips, polypropylene bags and ropes, clinker, polypropylene fabrics, knitted fabrics, louver window frames, shirts, wood screws, and incense sticks and chemicals used as raw materials in their manufacture, are subject to individual import licensing; licenses for some of these items are issued restrictively. A wide range of consumer goods is imported by national cooperative societies under a jo int arrangement with six other Pacific Island countries. Import prohibitions are imposed on a few commodities from all sources, mainly for security, health, or public policy reasons. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon application and submission of documentary evidence to authorized dealers, who may allow payments for goods that have been imported under either a specific import license or an open general license. Authorized banks may allow advance payments of up to F$2,000 for all imports, provided the goods are imported into Fiji within 90 days of the date the payment is made. Approval of the Reserve Bank of Fiji is required in cases where amounts exceed F$2,000. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are permitted either under a delegated authority to banks or, where large amounts or nondelegated payments are involved, upon application to the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Payments may be made freely for all bona fide current transactions. Approval of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, however, is required in cases where amounts exceed the established limits. Residents of Fiji traveling to other countries may obtain from a bank, without reference to the Reserve Bank, a foreign currency travel allowance for a private or business visit up to the equivalent of F$ 1,000 a person a jou rney; amounts in excess of this limit are approved by the Reserve Bank of ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Fiji in case of genuine need supported by documentary proof. There is no restriction on the number of trips a resident may make in any one year. Each traveler may take with him F$100 in Fiji currency and the equivalent of F$500 in other currencies, provided that these amounts are not in addition to travel allowances approved by a bank or the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Residents of Fiji are allowed to make cash gifts to nonresidents equivalent to F$100 a donor a year; additional funds are permitted in compassionate cases. Exports and Export Proceeds Specific licenses are required only for exports of rice, sugar, wheat bran, copra meal, certain lumber, scrap metals, certain animals, and a few other items. Irrespec- tive of any export licensing requ iremen ts, however, ex- porters are required to produce an export permit for commercial consignment of all goods with an f.o.b. value exceeding F$ 1,000; this permit is required for exchange control purposes. Exporters are required to collect the proceeds of exports within six months of the date of exportation of the goods from Fiji, and may not grant credit to a nonresident buyer in excess of six months without specific permission. All foreign currencies must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer within one month of receipt. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to authorized dealers. Travelers may bring in freely any amount in Fiji notes or foreign currency notes. Residents are required to sell their foreign currency holdings to an authorized dealer within one month of return. Capital The inflow of capital in any form requires specific permission of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Foreign invest- ment in Fiji normally is expected to be financed from a nonresident source. Such foreign inves tment may be given "approved status," which guarantees the right to repa- triate dividends and capital. Overseas investments and other forms of capital transfers abroad have been tem- porarily suspended. Remittances of dividends and re- tained profits accumulated in previous years have been temporarily restricted, but remittances of dividends and retained profits from current year earnings are not restricted. Authority is delegated to banks operating in Fiji to approve transactions involving F$50,000 or more arising from (1) the conversion of foreign currency into Fiji currency, whether for credit to a resident account or to an External Account; and (2) the crediting of an External Account with Fiji currency emanating from another Ex- ternal Account (including Fiji currency accounts of over- seas banks). The banks must send confirmation of such inflows to the Reserve Bank; they must also have the approval of the Bank before granting any loans in excess of F$ 10,000 to a company or branch in Fiji (other than a FIJI bank) that is controlled directly or indirectly by persons resident outside Fiji or by individuals designated as nonresidents; however, the banks do not need such approval to lend up to F$l0,000 to individual nonresident customers, who must repay such loans prior to their departure from Fiji. The banks may not lend foreign currency to any resident of Fiji without the specific permission of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Residents require permission from the Reserve Bank of Fiji before they may borrow foreign currency in Fiji or abroad. The transfer of inheritances and dowries due to non- residents is permitted, as is the transfer of the proceeds from the sale of a house owned by a nonresident. The transfer of funds by emigrants on departure is limited to F$4,000 per head of household applicant and F$2,000 per dependent. Following settlement in the destination coun- try, emigrants are entitled, upon approval of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, to transfer up to F$3,000 per month per family for a period of 12 months. The facility for residents to purchase foreign currency up to a maximum of F$5,000 a family a year to acquire foreign currency securities has been suspended. The purchase of personal real property outside Fiji is not permitted. Special tax incentives are granted for invest- ments in the tourism industry, and an investment allow- ance similar to that for the hotel industry is provided for large outlay investment projects supportive of the tourist industry. Portfolio investment in Fiji by nonresidents requires approval by the Reserve Bank; the proceeds of the sale or realization of such investment may be repa- triated. Banks require exchange control permission to borrow abroad; they may accept deposits from nonresi- dents. Prepayment of external borrowing is prohibited and all repayments must be in conformity with the schedule in the loan contract. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold coin in Fiji but not gold bullion. The export of gold coin, except numismatic coins and collectors' pieces, requires the specific permission of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Gold imports from all sources, other than imports of gold coin, require a specific import license issued by the Ministry of Finance; these are restricted to authorized gold dealers. Gold coin is free of customs duty and fiscal tax, while gold bullion is exempt from customs duty but is subject to a fiscal tax of 10 percent. Gold jewelry is subject to customs duty at the rate of 7.5 percent and to a fiscal duty of 20 percent but does not require any license when valued at less than F$200; samples of gold and gold jewelry sent by foreign manufacturers require import licenses if over F$200 in value. Exports of gold jewelry are free of export duty, but they require licenses if their value exceeds F$ 1,000. All newly mined gold is refined in Australia and sold at free market prices. Commemorative gold coins of F$100, F$200, and F$250 have been issued; these are legal tender but do not normally circulate. 203 ©International Monetary Fund.

Overseas investments and other forms of capital transfers abroad by residents were suspended. 204 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FINLAND (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Finland is the Finnish Markka. The external value of the markka is defined in terms of an index reflecting a weighted average of the exchange rates of the convertible currencies most important for Finland's foreign trade. These are defined as the convertible cur- rencies of countries that have accounted for not less than 1 percent of Finland's commodity imports and exports in each of the preceding three calendar years. The value of the exchange rate index is maintained by the Suomen Pankki (Bank of Finland) within a margin established by the Council of State; since January 1984 the range has been 101.3-106.0 (1982 = 100). The actual level of the index has been in the range of 102.3-105.2 since March 1984. The index weights are adjusted quarterly and based on the average trade shares for the past two years; the base year is changed annually. The Suomen Pankki calculates and publishes the currency index on a daily basis. Daily (noon) buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, are quoted by the Suomen Pankki. On December 31, 1987 the rates were Fmk 3.938 and Fmk 3.954 per US$1, respectively. Buying and selling rates for the clearing ruble are based on the rates of the State Bank of the U.S.S.R. for the U.S. dollar against the ruble. Quotations for other currencies are based on market cross rates. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized banks may deal among themselves, with residents, and with nonresident banks in U.S. dollars and other convertible currencies. Nonbanks may obtain for- ward cover for authorized transactions only. Forward premiums and discounts quoted by authorized banks reflect interest rate differentials in the countries of various currencies. The Suomen Pankki does not provide forward cover for commercial banks. It also does not quote forward ruble rates. Finland formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from September 25, 1979. Administration of Control The Suomen Pankki operates the exchange control system, delegating authority in practice to the authorized banks (mainly commercial banks). Import and export licensing is administered by the Export and Import Permits Office (a unit subordinate to the Ministry of Trade and Industry), which is headed by a board composed of government officials, including a representative of the Suomen Pankki. Prescription of Currency For prescription of currency purposes, countries are divided into two groups: the convertible currency coun- tries and the bilateral countries.1 Settlements with the bilateral countries must be made in the currency of the agreement (the clearing ruble for the U.S.S.R., the clear- ing Finnish markka for Bulgaria and the German Demo- cratic Republic). Settlements with the convertible cur- rency countries may be made in any convertible currency or through Convertible Accounts. Nonresident Accounts There are two categories of nonresident accounts: Convertible Accounts and Domestic Markka Accounts.2 Convertible Accounts are held by nonresidents in any convertible currency, including Finnish markka. These accounts may be credited by an authorized bank with amounts transferred from other Convertible Accounts, with Finnish currency received directly from a foreign bank or imported into Finland, with amounts which the bank would be authorized to transfer abroad, with amounts of convertible currency received by the bank, and with interest accrued on funds held in the accounts. These accounts may be debited freely and balances may be transferred abroad to any country. Domestic Markka Accounts comprise all other nonres- ident accounts. They are held in markkaa and are intended primarily for payments of a capital nature. The transfer abroad of funds in a Domestic Markka Account requires the special permission of the Suomen Pankki in most cases. A monetary institution may credit a Domestic Markka Account with the purchase price of assets other than foreign securities bought from the holder by a resident, with funds received as an inheritance, and with redemption payments and interest on matured bonds and debentures quoted on the Helsinki Stock Exchange or on the authorized banks' OTC markets. These accounts may also be credited with rent on property owned in Finland by the holder of the account, with proceeds from other assets belonging to the holder of the account and managed by the monetary institution with which the account is 1 Finland maintains bilateral payments agreements with Bulgaria, Czech- oslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and the U.S.S.R. Transactions with Czechoslovakia and Poland have, however, been settled in freely convertible U.S. dollars since 1970 under agreements concluded for each year. Under an agreement concluded between Finland and Czechoslovakia in August 1985, the practice whereby transactions are settled in convertible currencies was extended for three years from the beginning of 1986; the payments arrangement is henceforth to be renewed automatically for three years, unless otherwise agreed. Under an agree- ment concluded between Finland and Poland in December 1985 and renewed for another year in December 1986, payments may be effected in Finnish markkaa as well as in U.S. dollars. In January 1987 Finland and the U.S.S.R. signed a credit agreement under which a maximum of rub 285 million was transferred from the clearing account between the two countries to a special interest-bearing account denominated in clearing rubles. This special account is protected by an exchange rate guarantee. The balance in the special account is to be repaid by the U.S.S.R. by the end of 1991, mainly in the form of shipments of goods paid for through the clearing account. 2 On January 1, 1986 previous "Restricted Accounts" were abolished, with the Suomen Pankki reserving the power to reintroduce them in case of need. 205 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FINLAND held, with the amount of a loan received from a resident in a permissible manner, and with interest accrued on funds held in the account. Domestic Markka Accounts may be debited freely for noncommercial current expenses in Finland of and for account of the holder, and funds in these accounts may be used for capital payments when the transaction does not require authorization or is authorized for transferable funds. Imports and Import Payments Most goods may be imported free of license from the multilateral countries, provided that the goods are pur- chased from and originate in those countries. However, certain goods3 may be imported from the multilateral area under a global quota system, which provides for import licenses to be issued at least up to the amounts of quotas for specified commodity groups. With the exception of the commodities to which ref- erence was made in the preceding paragraph, import licenses are not required for most commodities originating in and purchased from the U.S.S.R., or originating in and purchased from the five countries with which agreements on the reciprocal removal of obstacles to trade have been concluded (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Dem- ocratic Republic, Hungary, and Poland). All imports of commodities originating in countries or areas not classified4 in either the multilateral area or the bilateral area require individual licenses. The State Granary is the main agency for the import of wheat, rye, barley, oats, and products of these grains for human consumption, but individual importers may also import these commodities under license. There is a state monopoly for imports of alcoholic beverages. Foreign exchange is granted freely by authorized banks for all imports for which licenses are granted, on pres- entation of an application form, the import license (when required for imports from countries with nonconvertible currencies), and the original commercial invoice, provided that the goods are already in the country or there is sufficient evidence to guarantee their importation. Pay- ment for imports must be made within six months after the date of customs clearance of the goods; if the import payment is made to the seller through foreign financing credits arranged by an authorized Finnish bank, the credit period may not exceed six months without a special permit. Payments for Invisibles Payments in respect of invisible transactions are not restricted. The authorized banks have general permission to effect payments for most invisibles. A Finnish resident traveling abroad may purchase from commercial banks foreign exchange without a limit on 3 Agricultural commodities, fish, fue ls and other petroleum products, and unwrought gold and silver. 4 Curren t ly, Taiwan Province of China (see Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 61) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 206 the basis of a breakdown of costs drawn up by the purchaser; the maximum limit is Fmk 10,000 per trip, if a cost breakdown is not provided. In the case of business travel, any amount may be made available by a bank. In addition, travel exchange may be acquired abroad up to the value of Fmk 10,000 by drawing checks against a Finnish bank account or by withdrawing funds against a passbook, a debit card, or a credit or charge card. A resident traveler may use a credit or charge card abroad without a limit on amount for travel services and settle the transaction after his return. Travel exchange and a credit or charge card may also be used to buy merchandise, provided that the purchase price of each such item does not exceed Fmk 10,000. The annual limit on freely remittable amounts for gifts and contributions to residents is Fmk 100,000. Nonresident travelers may take out of the country Fmk 10,000 a trip in Finnish or foreign bank notes and coin and any amount in Finnish or foreign bank notes and coin declared upon en try; resident travelers may take out of the country foreign or domestic currency, or any combination of these, up to Fmk 10,000, without the export certificate for means of payment. Exports and Export Proceeds Exporters are required to repatriate foreign exchange proceeds within eight days of collection, which may then be held in a domestic foreign currency account with an authorized bank in Finland or be converted into domestic currency. Export licenses are required only for exports of scrap metal. Sales of arms are strictly controlled. Exports to coun- tries (e.g., the U.S.S.R) that are not in the convertible area and that are outside the scope of agreements on the reciprocal removal of obstacles to trade are allocated by means of bilateral trade arrangements. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from current invisibles must be repatriated within eight days of collection. The funds may be held in a domestic foreign currency account in Finland. Any unutilized foreign bank notes and traveler's checks must be repatriated, but these are exempt from the repatriation requirement up to Fmk 10,000 for assets held in Finland. The import of domestic and foreign currency and coin is unrestricted. Capital External borrowing by Finnish residents, particularly in the form of short-term or long-term financial credits, including bond issues abroad, requires the specific ap- proval of the Suomen Pankki, which exercises surveil- lance over the amount of capital inflows as well as the terms and timing. The Suomen Pankki has exempted from regulation foreign credits with at least a five-year maturity that have been raised by companies. The authorized banks and certain other financial institutions are entitled to act as intermediaries between such credits and their corporate customers. The credit terms and, in the case of bonds and debentures, the timing of credits must also ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution receive prior approval of the Suomen Pankki. Early repayments require the permission of the Suomen Pankki. Lending to nonresidents by nonbanks is generally re- stricted to export credits. Permission is not required for customary export credits up to three months; suppliers' credits to residents of Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, and the U.S.S.R. are, however, subject to special permit by the Suomen Pankki. International bank- ing activities of Finnish authorized banks are mostly free of regulations, but are subject to certain supervisory reporting requirements. Most outward transfers of nonresident capital are sub- ject to approval by the Suomen Pankki. Authorization is granted, however, for residents of Finland to invest in foreign listed securities, to place funds in accounts with foreign monetary ins t i tu t ions, or to leave foreign claims unrepatriated up to a cumulative total of the equivalent of Fmk 50,000 per person. Outward direct investments are freely permitted up to a cumulative limit of Fmk 30 million without applying to the Suomen Pankki. Inheritances are transferred to the beneficiaries after verification. Persons who have resided outside Finland during the previous calendar year and continue to do so are allowed to transfer abroad their net assets in Finland in one lump sum, subject to the prior approval of the Suomen Pankki. Nonresidents may purchase Finnish securities, only if they are shares or related options quoted on the Helsinki Stock Exchange or on the authorized banks' OTC market in Finland through an authorized bank or a securities agent against convertible currencies, or by debiting a Convertible Account. A nonresident purchaser of Finnish shares is permitted to sell them through an authorized bank or a securities agent and to transfer abroad the net proceeds of the sale in a convertible currency. The acquisition of shares quoted on the Helsinki Stock Ex- change or on the authorized banks' OTC markets in Finland with funds from Domestic Markka Accounts is also permitted automatically if they are acquired by an authorized bank or a securities agent, but proceeds from the sale of such securities may not be transferred abroad without the permission of the Suomen Pankki. Other transactions in securities require approval in most cases. Inward direct inves tmen ts require the approval of the Council of State if they involve purchases of property and real estate. Such approval is usually granted, with the exception of investments in the forest and mining industries and in certain traditionally regulated activities. The transfer of direct investment capital requires autho- rization by the Suomen Pankki. Such authorization is usually granted, if the underlying inves tment has been approved by the Council of State. Repatriation of direct investment is subject to the verification of the Suomen Pankki. Outward transfers of capital, including transfers of direct inves tment in excess of Fmk 30 million by residents, require individual approval by the Suomen Pankki. Proceeds from the sale of securities and real property FINLAND must be repatriated under the general rule of repatriation. Subject to certain regulations, authorized banks, securi- ties agents, and insurance companies have permission to purchase foreign and Finnish securities issued abroad. Purchases of real estate abroad are authorized up to a limit of Fmk 600,000 a person without the special permit of the Suomen Pankki. The upper limit on shares entitling part time use of a real estate abroad is Fmk 600 000. The Suomen Pankki may grant permission for acquisition of a dwelling at a price exceeding Fmk 600,000. Finnish emigrants are permitted to transfer abroad assets owned prior to their departure. Gold Residents may freely hold, buy, and sell gold in any form in Finland. Imports of unwrought gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Export and Import Permits Office; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. The global quota list contains a quota for industrial gold, for which licenses are granted freely. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement October I. The Suomen Pankki allowed residents of Finalnd to enter into forward exchange contracts with an authorized bank for the purposes of covering interest rate and exchange rate risks that are related to claims and liabilities permitted under the Foreign Exchange Regu- lations or approved on the basis of a permit issued by the Suomen Pankki. On request, a resident must be able to provide the Suomen Pankki with clarification on any fu tu re contracts that may be taken out at any time during the period of validity of the contract. Residents are allowed to enter into interest rate and currency fu ture contracts involving two foreign currencies with a nonres- ident under the same conditions as an authorized bank. The Suomen Pankki also allowed residents of Finland to purchase from an authorized bank currency options involving two foreign currencies as well as currency option contracts involving the Finnish markka and a foreign currency and to sell (write) to an authorized bank currency options involving two foreign currencies to cover such specifically stated exchange risk as is related to existing or otherwise envisaged foreign currency claims or liabilities permitted under the Foreign Exchange Reg- ulations or approved on the basis of a permit issued by the Suomen Pankki. A resident is not allowed to sell (write) options denominated in markkaa without the permission of the Suomen Pankki. The Suomen Pankki also announced that foreign ex- change transactions pertaining to imports of goods and services can be effected as current foreign exchange transactions without the permission of the Suomen Pankki, if (1) the maturity period of a suppliers' credit does not exceed six months; (2) the purchase price of goods does 207 ©International Monetary Fund.

Capital Augusf } The Suomen Pankki extended the exemption from the regulations of foreign credits with a maturity of at least five years that had been granted to manufacturing and shipping companies to companies or cooperative societies that are engaged in business activity. Financial and insurance institutions, housing, and real estate com- panics were not exempted. Suppliers' credits were al- lowed to be raised directly through foreign creditors. 208 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FRANCE (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of France is the Franc. France participates with Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Ger- many, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, France maintains the spot exchange rates between the franc and the currencies of the other partic- ipants within margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in European Cur- rency Units (ECUs). The agreement implies that the Bank of France (the Central Bank) stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. On December 31, 1987 these rates were as follows: Francs Upper limit Lower limit Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 16.631 15.899 100 Danish kroner 89.925 85.970 327.92 100 deutsche mark 343.05 100 Netherlands guilders 304.44 291.04 100 Irish pounds 918.90 878.50 100 Italian lire 0.4941 0.4383 The participants in the EMS do not maintain the exchange rates for other currencies w i th in fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper func t ion ing of the system, they intervene in concert to smooth out fluctua- tions in exchange rates, the intervention currencies being each other's and the U.S. dollar. Buying and selling rates for 20 foreign currencies are quoted daily on the basis of market rates.1 On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were F 5.323 and F 5.328, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Fixed conversion rates in terms of the franc apply to the currencies of the overseas territories and to the currencies of the countries that are linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account2 as follows: (1) In the overseas territories of French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Wallis and Futuna Islands, the currency used is the CFP franc, which has a fixed parity with the franc of CFPF 1 = F 0.055. (2) Fixed conversion rates in terms of the franc apply to the currencies of the 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Djibouti francs, Finnish markkaa, Greek drachmas, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, and zaires. 2 Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. Operations Account countries (see footnote 2). These rates are CFAF 1 = F 0.02 for the CFA franc, which circulates in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. Authorized banks in France and in Monaco, which may also act on behalf of banks established abroad or in Operations Account countries, are permitted to deal spot or forward in the exchange market in France. Authorized banks may also deal spot and forward with their corre- spondents in foreign markets in all currencies. Nonbank residents may purchase foreign exchange forward in respect of specified transactions. Forward cover in foreign currency, including the ECU, for import payments is free. Forward cover may be obtained for fu ture outlays for direct investment and debt service obligations, and there is no limit on the maturity of contract. Forward sales of foreign currency are not restricted. France formally accepted the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Exchange Control Territory The exchange control regulations are applicable in all territories of the French Republic, that is, in continental France, Corsica, the Overseas Departments (Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Reunion, and St. Pierre and Miquelon), Mayotte, and the three Overseas Territories (Wallis and Futuna Islands, New Caledonia, and French Polynesia). No exchange control is applied in relation to Monaco or the Operations Account countries (see foot- note 2); payments between France and these countries are free of restriction on the part of France and take place at fixed exchange rates. All other countries are considered foreign countries for exchange control pur- poses; all payments between France and foreign countries are subject to exchange control. The exchange control regulations include controls over inward direct investment and other lending abroad on the basis of Decree No. 68-1021 of November 24, 1968. This decree is applicable to financial relations with all countries except those belonging to the French Franc Zone (i.e., Operations Account countries). Certain exchange oper- ations are free from any prior authorization; these include direct investment coming from and going to European Communities (EC) countries, which are nevertheless submitted to prior notification. Administration of Control The Directorate of the Treasury of the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and the Budget is the coordinating agency for financial relations with foreign countries. It is responsible for exchange control and all matters relating to inward and outward direct investment and to borrowing 209 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FRANCE abroad, unless they relate to real estate companies, in which case the Bank of France screens applications. The Directorate of the Treasury also evaluates the balance of payments, together with the Bank of France, which collects the data for its compilation. Certain exchange control powers have been delegated to the Bank of France and to the Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes and, in the Overseas Departments and Territories, to the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE). The Directorate of Insurance of the Ministry of Econ- omy, Finance, and the Budget has certain powers in respect of matters relating to insurance, reinsurance, annuities, etc. The execution of all transfers has been delegated to authorized banks and stockbrokers and to the Postal Administration. The Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes establishes import and export procedures and controls, within the framework of com- mercial policy directives given by the Directorate of Foreign Economic Relations (DREE); the Directorate- General also issues import and export licenses and is responsible for any litigation relating to the exchange regulations. Technical visas required for certain imports and exports are issued by the appropriate ministry or by the Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes. The Ministry of Industry has certain responsibilities in respect of licensing contracts and contracts relating to technical assistance. Prescription of Currency Settlements with the Operations Account countries may be made in francs or the currency issued by any institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury.3 Settlements with all other countries may be made in any of the currencies of those countries or through nonresident Foreign Accounts in Francs. Importers and exporters are free to invoice in any currency. Nonresident Accounts A nonresident account in francs may be freely opened by an authorized bank for nonresidents, including French nationals (other than officials) who are residing abroad, with specific permission. All overdrafts and advances on non-resident-held franc accounts are subject to general or specific permission. Nonresident accounts may be operated freely. If francs accruing to a nonresident are not transferable, or are not immediately transferable, they may be credited to a Suspense Account in Francs in the name of the beneficiary. Emigrants of foreign or French nationality may take out all of their assets upon departure. In addition, nonresidents may hold foreign currency accounts with French and foreign-owned banks. Imports and Import Payments Goods originating in and shipped from other countries that are accorded privileged treatment in respect of trade 3 Comprising the ins t i tu tes of issue of the Operations Account countries and the Overseas Ins t i tu te of Issue (for New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Mayotte, and Wallis and Fu tuna Islands). 210 transactions (see section on Exchange Control Territory, above) are generally admitted free of quantitative restric- tions and individual licenses. Imports of goods that originate in other countries and are not covered by French import liberalization require individual licenses. Some imports from non-EC countries are subject to minimum prices; these require an administrative visa and some- times, exceptionally, an import license. Certain imports require certificates of origin. For import control purposes, countries other than those that are accorded privileged treatment are divided into four groups according to the extent of import liberaliza- tion: (1) the former Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) countries, their dependent territo- ries and certain former dependent territories, Andorra, Canada, Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Liberia, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, United States, Western Samoa, and Yugoslavia; (2) some spec- ified countries;4 (3) the Eastern European countries (Al- bania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Ro- mania, and U.S.S.R.), People's Republic of China, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Mongolia; and (4) German Democratic Republic. Goods covered by the import liberalization arrangements applicable to one country may be imported freely from another country, provided that the country of origin and the country of shipment both benefit from the same degree of liberalization. Imports of practically all industrial products from coun- tries in group (1) are free of quantitative restrictions, but restrictions are applied to a number of agricultural and electronic products; there is relatively little difference between the lists of goods that may be imported freely from different countries in this group. Imports of certain industrial products from countries in group (2) are re- stricted, and restrictions are applied to these and to certain additional industrial products from group (3) countries. For some commodities, global quotas are allocated annually (petroleum and petroleum products) or semiannually and apply to all countries (other than those that have bilaterally negotiated quotas or receive privileged treatment). Imports from all countries of certain agricultural items and certain raw materials are free of quantitative restrictions. Imports from non-EC countries of most products cov- ered by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EC are subject to variable import levies that have replaced all previous barriers to imports; common EC regulations are also applied to imports from non-EC countries of most other agricultural and livestock products. Liberalized imports are not subject to trade controls, but do require a customs document that constitutes the customs declaration. For some liberalized imports, an 4 Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Bhu tan, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uruguay, Venezuela, Yemen Arab Republic, and People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution administrative visa issued by the Central Customs Admin- istration or by the appropriate ministry is required on an import declaration. Imports of the products of the Eu- ropean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) require such administrative visas when originating in non-ECSC countries. Other imports generally require individual import li- censes. These are granted up to quotas determined on an individual commodity basis or for a group of commodities and are applicable to specified countries or areas in accordance with trade agreements or an import plan drawn up for a definite period. Imports of some products must pass through designated customs offices. Documents accompanying goods passing through customs must be written in or translated into French. Payments for imports from foreign countries must be made by credit to a Foreign Account in Francs or with foreign currency purchased in the French exchange mar- ket. Payments may be made by transfer through an authorized bank, by credit card or by check. Checks may be used without limit if they are given to a nonresident holding a nonresident account opened in an authorized bank in France, or if they are drawn on a foreign exchange resident account. They may be used up to a limit of F 50,000 or the equivalent in foreign exchange if they are drawn on a resident account in francs. The amounts that may be transferred through postal channels are not subject to limitation, but in practice, the Postal Administration does not make import payments valued at over F 250,000. Authorized banks may without special authorization permit advance payments to be made that are provided for in the commercial contract. For all imports, importers may purchase spot foreign currency three months before utilization; utilization cannot take place before the pay- ment falls due. There is no restriction on the use of suppliers' credits. Importers can hold resident accounts in foreign exchange, provided that the credit balance does not exceed the equivalent of three months of imports. Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles to foreign countries are controlled but are not restricted as to amount. If justifying documents are presented and certain exchange control requirements are met, authorized banks are permitted to approve applications for payments for many categories of current invisibles without any limitation. Any resident may make remittances abroad up to the equivalent of F 10,000 a transaction, provided that the transfers do not serve as a means of accumulating funds abroad. Outward remittances for family support abroad and transfers of donations to nonresidents are freely permitted. Payments that may be authorized without limitation by authorized banks include those related to approved trade transactions; income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties; banking commissions, patent fees, and specified categories of taxes; specified insurance payments; fees to medical doctors, lawyers, etc.; alimony in accordance with court decisions; and net FRANCE salaries or wages of foreigners employed in France, provided that the transfer takes place within three months from the date of payment. Irrespective of the exchange control regulations, certain transactions between persons or firms in France and abroad are subject to restriction; these include certain transactions relating to insurance, reinsurance, and road and river transport. There are no limits on expenditures for travel abroad. There is no restriction on the amount of foreign or domestic bank notes resident and nonresident travelers may take out, but amounts exceeding F 50,000 and its equivalent must be declared to the customs upon departure. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain goods on a prohibited export list may be exported only under a special license. Some other exports also require individual licenses, but if the total value does not exceed F 1,000 (F 5,000 for art objects or collectors' items), these exports may be permitted without any formality, subject to certain exceptions. Exports to foreign countries are subject to exchange control. Payment must be received through the exchange market. The repatriation5 and, where appropriate, the surrender by sale in the exchange market of proceeds from exports to foreign countries are required not later than three months from the date of receipt. As from May 1987, exporters may hold foreign currency accounts, at home and abroad, provided that credit balances do not exceed three months' foreign exchange turnover. Ex- porters are allowed forward coverage of an unlimited period. Authorized banks may freely extend foreign currency advances to exporters; such advances and their repayment may be settled by the receipts of the corre- sponding exports. Certain goods purchased in France by persons not normally residing in France are considered as exports, even when paid for in francs, and are exempt from taxes. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with Monaco and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those coun- tries from foreign assets (with the exception of income from work in border areas) must be repatriated and, where appropriate, surrendered within three months from the due date. With minor exceptions for certain types of transactions, services performed for nonresidents do not require licenses. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin (except gold coin) in francs, CFA francs, CFP francs, or any foreign currency; amounts exceeding F 50,000, however, must be declared at customs upon arrival. The exchange of bank notes 5 Repatriation may take place either by collection of foreign currency or by debit to a Foreign Account in Francs. 211 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FRANCE issued by Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia is prohibited at the request of those countries. Resident travelers must sell in the exchange market any foreign bank notes or traveler's checks in excess of F 10,000 within three months of entry. Capital Capital movements between France and Monaco and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; purchases of French and foreign securities abroad and outward transfers of resident-owned capital are free; capital receipts from foreign countries are permitted freely, provided that the foreign exchange proceeds are surrendered by sale in the exchange market (but see below for special controls over borrowing abroad and over inward direct investment). Capital assets abroad of residents are not subject to repatriation. The transfer abroad of non-resident-owned funds, including the sales proceeds of capital assets, is not restricted. French and foreign securities held in France by non- residents may be exported, provided that they have been deposited with an authorized bank in a foreign dossier (dossier etranger de valeurs mobilieres)', French securities held under a foreign dossier can also be sold in France and the sales proceeds can be transferred abroad. Foreign securities held in France by a nonresident must be deposited with an authorized bank; French securities held in France by nonresidents need not be deposited but cannot be dealt with or exported unless they have been deposited. Foreign securities held in France by residents must be deposited with a qualified bank or broker. Residents may hold French and foreign securities abroad under the control of a French authorized bank or broker. The export for the account of residents of French secu- rities held in France is prohibited, except when they are to be sold abroad. Subject to compliance with the special regulations concerning inward and outward direct investment, resi- dents may purchase abroad French and foreign securities on stock exchanges and securities that are not quoted on a recognized stock exchange through authorized banks. French and foreign securities may be held or sold abroad, but they may also be imported and then either held or sold on a French stock exchange. Correspondingly, non- residents holding French or foreign securities abroad (whether acquired before November 24, 1968 or later) may import them into France through an authorized bank and hold them in a foreign dossier or sell them on a French stock exchange. The exchange control regulations include controls over inward direct investment and other borrowing abroad on the basis of Decree No. 68-1021 of November 24, 1968. This decree is applicable to financial relations with all countries except those belonging to the French Franc Zone (i.e., Operations Account countries). As from May 1987, enterprises may freely contract foreign loans in foreign currencies and in French francs up to F 50 million per operation. Certain exchange operations are free from 212 any prior authorization; these include direct investments coming from EC countries, which are nevertheless subject to prior notification. Foreign direct investments in France require prior declaration to the Minister of Economy, Finance, and the Budget. Direct investments are defined as investments leading to control of a company or enterprise. Any participation exceeding 20 percent of the capital is con- sidered as direct investment. A participation that does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a firm whose shares are quoted on the stock exchange is not considered as direct investment. To determine whether a company is foreign controlled, the Treasury may also take into account any special relationships resulting from such factors as stock options, patents and licenses, and com- mercial contracts. Under specified provisos, foreign com- panies controlled by EC residents are free to establish a subsidiary and to take over any participation in the equity capital of a French company. Foreign companies con- trolled by other nonresidents may establish a subsidiary or take over any participation under F 10 million in a French company within one month following the decla- ration, unless the Minister of Economy, Finance, and the Budget formally notifies the companies of its decision to postpone the operation; such a decision is highly excep- tional. Whatever the nationality of a nonresident investor, the Treasury is, however, entitled to issue a finding within one month to forbid such an establishment or participa- tion, should it be deemed to jeopardize public health, order, security, or defense. Takeovers of French companies by non-EC residents amounting to more than F 10 mil- lion, as well as changes in shareholder's ownership percentage of any foreign-controlled corporation, require an authorization. Exemptions from declaration or ap- proval requirements are granted for increases of equity capital of a subsidiary by the parent company and for loans granted by a parent company to its subsidiary. Foreign participation in newly privatized companies is restricted to 20 percent of the capital. The liquidation proceeds of foreign direct investment in France may be freely transferred abroad; the liquidation itself must be reported to the Minister within 20 days of its occurrence. Direct foreign investments by residents are not restricted but must be reported to the Ministry of Economy within 20 days if they exceed F 5 million. The liquidation of direct investment abroad is free from any prior application, provided that the corresponding funds are repatriated to France in due time and reported to the Ministry of Economy if they exceed F 5 million. Foreign issues on the French capital market, except issues originating from EC countries, are subject to prior authorization by the Minister of Economy, Finance, and the Budget. The requirement is applicable also to the Operations Account countries. Exempt from authoriza- tion, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the French Government, and (2) shares similar to securities that are already officially quoted on a stock exchange in France. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal resi- dence or registered office is in France, or by branches or subsidiaries in France of juridical persons whose regis- tered office is abroad, is unrestricted, provided that the loan is surrendered. Borrowing abroad in French francs is subject to prior authorization if it exceeds F 50 million. The application of the controls over direct investment and borrowing is delegated to the Bank of France insofar as they relate to French firms that are mainly engaged in real estate business. Lending abroad is subject only to exchange control authorization by the Bank of France within the framework of directives issued by the Treasury. Since the imposition of exchange control in 1968, authorized banks have been virtually free to lend foreign currency to nonresidents, subject to certain reservations in respect of the granting of guarantees and varying limitations on their external position, and to resident importers and exporters. Lending to nonresidents in francs is free if financed by funds deposited by nonresidents. Authorized banks' foreign currency assets and their overall liabilities in francs and foreign currency to nonresidents are free from limitation. Nonresidents may freely purchase French short-term securities, including Treasury bills, bons de caisse, and private drafts. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire regularly, and dispose of gold in any form in France. They may continue to hold abroad any gold they held there prior to Novem- ber 25, 1968. There is a free gold market for bars and coin in Paris, to which residents and nonresidents have free access and in which normally no official intervention takes place. Imports and exports of "monetary" gold (defined as gold having a fineness or a weight that is recognized in the gold market) into or from the territory of continental France are now governed by the regulations applying to ordinary goods. Movements of industrial gold are subject to a simple declaration, as are imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold, such as gold-filled and gold-plated articles. Collectors' items of gold and gold antiques are subject to specific regulations. Most gold coins are traded on the Paris stock exchange. In domestic trading, purchases of bars and coin are not subject to value-added tax. Imports of monetary gold, except gold imported by the Bank of France, are subject to customs duty and value-added tax. Domestic trans- actions in gold and gold coin are subject to capital gains tax. FRANCE Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 12. The central rate of the French franc in the EMS was changed from ECU 1 = F 6.86402 to ECU 1 = F 6.90403, and the following new bilateral rates of the French franc against the Belgian/Luxembourg franc, the deutsche mark, and the Netherlands guilder were set: Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 100 deutsche mark 100 Netherlands guilders Francs Upper limit Lower limit 16.631 343.05 304.44 15.899 327.92 291.04 May 21. Enterprises were allowed to cover exchange rate risk with forward exchange purchases without prior approval. Nonresident Accounts April 2.

In addition, borrowing abroad in francs was allowed up to a limit of F 50 million per operation. 213 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GABON (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Gabon is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transactions in French francs between the BEAC and commercial banks at present take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1. Buying and selling rates for certain foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market, and include a commission. Commissions are charged at the rate of 0.25 per mill on transfers made by the banks for their own accounts, and 0.225 per mill on all private capital transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except those made for the account of the Treasury, national accounting offices, national and international public agencies, and private entities granted exemption by the Ministry of Economy and Finance because of the nature of their activities. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, Gabon's exchange control measures do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Mo- naco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Ac- count (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control The Directorate of Financial Institutions in the Ministry of Finance, Budget and Participations supervises borrow- ing and lending abroad. Exchange control is administered by the Minister of Economy, Budget and Participations, who has partly delegated his approval authority for current payments to the authorized banks and that with respect to the external position of the banks to the BEAC. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized intermediaries —that is, the Postal Administration and authorized banks. Import and export authorizations, where necessary, are issued by the Directorate of External Trade of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Prescription of Currency Since Gabon is an Operations Account country, settle- ments with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, 1 The CFA franc circulating in Gabon is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Congo, and Equatorial Guinea. 214 French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BEAC bank notes may be credited to Foreign Accounts in Francs when they have been mailed to the BEAC agency in Libreville by an authorized bank's foreign correspondent. Otherwise, the crediting to nonresident accounts of BEAC bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is prohibited. Imports and Import Payments In general, imports from member countries of the Central African Customs and Economic Union (UDEAC) are free of formalities; imports of refined vegetable oil from these countries require prior approval. All imports from countries outside the UDEAC are subject to an authorization to import (when the value is more than CFAF 500,000). All imports, of any origin, are subject to authorization. For perishables and spare parts, an antic- ipatory authorization is given to simplify administrative procedures. Imports from countries outside the UDEAC that are similar to, and compete w i th, domestic products are subject to licensing, bu t, with a few exceptions2 established by Ministerial Order, import authorizations are granted liberally in practice. Some imports are pro- hibited for security and health reasons. Imports of refined vegetable oil are suspended except when originating from member countries of the UDEAC. All imports of com- mercial goods must be insured through authorized insur- ance companies in Gabon. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Authoriza- tions duly endorsed by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (Directorate of Financial Institutions) entitle importers to purchase the necessary foreign exchange, provided that the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are per- mitted free ly; those to other countries are subject to approval, which is granted when the appropriate docu- ments are submitted. For many types of payment the 2 Curren t ly totaling about 30 i tems, inc lud ing cemen t, ham, mineral water, plastic goods, sugar, batteries, and refined vegetable oil. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Payments for invisibles related to trade are per- mitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Oper- ations Account countries may obtain an exchange allo- cation equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a person a trip (CFAF 100,000 for children under 10 years) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange remaining after return to Gabon must be surrendered. For business travel to foreign countries, there is a special allocation equivalent to CFAF 25,000 a day, subject to a max imum of CFAF 500,000 a trip. Tourist and business travel allocations may not be combined. Travelers to foreign countries may take out up to a max imum of CFAF 25,000 in BEAC bank notes; the amount taken out is not deducted from the travel allocation. Travelers to France, Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries may not export CFA or French bank notes in excess of an amount equivalent to CFAF 200,000 (CFAF 100,000 for children under 10 years) for tourist travel; for business travel the amount of such bank notes that may be carried out is the equivalent of CFAF 25,000 a day and CFAF 500,000 a trip. Transfers may be effected w i thout limit through the banking or postal systems. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports require authorization, irrespective of destina- tion. Export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or an Operations Account country must be surrendered. Export proceeds normally must be received w i th in 150 days after the arrival of the commodities at their desti- nation. The proceeds must be collected and, if received in a foreign currency, surrendered within one month of the due date. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and, if received in foreign currency, be surren- dered within a month of the due date. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. GABON Capital Capital movements between Gabon and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require the approval of the Direc- torate of Financial Institutions and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. All foreign securities, foreign currency, and titles em- bodying claims on foreign countries or nonresidents that are held in Gabon by residents or nonresidents must be deposited with authorized banks in Gabon. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Gabon; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of controls over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in Gabon, the control measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. Direct investments abroad3 must be declared to the Ministry of Economy and Finance unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; the full or partial liquidation of such investments also must be declared to the Ministry unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct investment abroad. Foreign direct investments in Gabon4 must be declared to the Ministry unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; within two months from receipt of the declaration, the Ministry may request the postpone- ment of the project. The full or partial liquidation of direct investments in Gabon must also be declared to the Ministry unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct investment in Gabon. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Gabonese investments abroad or foreign in- vestments in Gabon, must be reported to the Ministry within 20 days following each operation. Direct invest- ments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Gabon requires prior authorization by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Exempt from autho- rization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Gabonese Govern- ment, and (2) shares similar to securities whose issue, advertising, or offering for sale in Gabon has previously been authorized. 3 Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Gabon and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Gabon. 4 Including those made by companies in Gabon that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Gabon of foreign companies. 215 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GABON Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal resi- dence or registered office is in Gabon, or by branches or subsidiaries in Gabon of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans con- stituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been obtained, as indicated above; (2) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commercial transactions either between Ga- bon and countries abroad or between foreign countries in which these persons or firms take part; (3) loans contracted by registered banks; and (4) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstand- ing does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower. The contracting of loans referred to under (4) that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be declared to the Directorate of Financial Institu- tions within 20 days of the operation, unless the total outstanding amount of all loans contracted abroad by the borrower is CFAF 5 million or less. Lending abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal residence or registered office is in Gabon, or by branches or subsidi- aries in Gabon of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans granted by registered banks; and (2) other loans, when the total amount outstanding does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one lender. The making of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be declared to the Directorate of Financial Institutions within 20 days of the operation, except when the total outstanding amount of all loans granted abroad by the lender does not exceed CFAF 5 million. Under the Investment Code of December 4, 1961, as amended on March 23, 1967 and July 9, 1971, any enterprise to be established in Gabon, whether domestic or foreign, is granted, under certain conditions, reduced duties and taxes on specified imports, as well as exemption from direct taxes on specified income. A minimum of 10 percent state participation is required for any enterprise located in Gabon. The Code provides for four categories of preferential treatment. In addition to fiscal privileges, eligible companies may receive protection against foreign competition and may be given priority in the allocation of imports, public credit, and government contracts. A Presidential Decree of April 11, 1975 provides that foreign companies investing in Gabon must offer shares for purchase by Gabonese nationals. Non-Gabonese firms or individuals are not permitted to own land in Gabon. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Gabon. Imports and exports of gold require the authorization of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). The export of gold is the monopoly of the Societe Gabonaise de Recherches et d'Exploitation Min- ieres (SOGAREM). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 216 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution THE GAMBIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of The Gambia is the Gambian Dalasi. On January 20, 1986 the previous system of a fixed peg to the pound sterling was abolished, and a floating exchange rate system was introduced. Commercial banks are free to transact either among themselves or with customers at exchange rates agreed on by the parties to these transactions. The Central Bank conducts a fixing session with the participation of the commercial banks to set the exchange rate to value official foreign exchange transactions during the following week. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On December 31, 1987 the midpoint exchange rate of the dalasi in the interbank market was D 12.75. Administration of Control Exchange control policy is determined by the Ministry of Finance and Trade. The day-to-day administration of exchange control is carried out by the Central Bank. The commercial banks, which have been appointed as au- thorized dealers, may authorize sales of foreign currencies for all current transactions. The Ministry of Finance and Trade is responsible for the issue of import and export licenses. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Settlements w i th other countries may be made and received in dalasis or pounds sterling from nonresident sources or in any other currency. Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) (Ben in, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Maur- itania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. External Accounts Accounts denominated in dalasis held by residents of other countries are designated external accounts. Such accounts may be opened without reference to the Central Bank when commercial banks are satisfied that the ac- count holders' source of funds is from abroad in con- vertible foreign currency. Designated external accounts may be credited w i th paymen ts from residents of other countries, w i th transfers from other external accounts, and with the proceeds of sales through the banking system of other convertible currencies. They may be debited for any payment to residents of other countries, for transfers to other external accounts, and for the purchase of other convertible currencies. Imports and Import Payments Importation of certain specified goods is prohibited from all sources for social, health, or security reasons. All other imports are freely permitted under open general licenses. Commercial banks are free to make payments for all imports, subject to evidence of shipment. Advance pay- ments in respect of imports may be made freely, provided that commercial banks are satisfied with the bona fide nature of such transactions. Payments for imports may be made in dalasis or pounds sterling to an External Account or in any other currency. All goods are subject to an import tax of 6 percent of the c.i.f. value; imports made by the Government, dip- lomatic missions, and charitable organizations are exempted. Payments for Invisibles Payments to nonresidents for current transactions are not restricted, provided that commercial banks are sat- isfied with documentary evidence that the payment is due. Commercial banks may sell foreign exchange for travel purposes and for making interest and profit remit- tances without prior approval. A traveler leaving The Gambia may take out D 75 in Gambian currency notes. Visitors to The Gambia do not have to declare their foreign currency. Exports and Export Proceeds The export of forestry products is subject to prior authorization by the Forestry Department. The export of all other goods can generally be made without individual licenses, if settlement is made in accordance with pro- cedures laid down by the Central Bank. Export proceeds must be received through a commercial bank within six months from the date of exportation in a convertible foreign currency or through transfers from a designated external account. The Gambia Produce Marketing Board is the authorized exporter of groundnut products, oil, palm kernels, cotton, and all derivatives of cotton. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in foreign currencies must be offered for sale to commercial banks. There is no restric- tion on the import of foreign currency notes, but the importation of Gambian currency notes is prohibited. Capital Inward transfers of capital for the purpose of direct equity investment are not restricted, but must be reported to the Exchange Control Department of the Central Bank. Prior exchange control approval is required in order for residents to accept loans in foreign currency from any source. Overdraft facilities may be provided by the banks to members of diplomatic and international missions in The Gambia up to reasonable amounts. Loans and advances 217 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Federal Republic of Germany is the Deutsche Mark. Germany1 participates with Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS), whereby each coun- try maintains the value of its currency in relation to the currencies of the other participating countries. Under this agreement, spot exchange rates between the deutsche mark and the currencies of the other participants are maintained within margins of 2.25 percent above or below the cross rates derived from the central rates expressed in European Currency Units (ECUs), except for the Italian lira, for which the temporary intervention limit is plus or minus 6 percent. The agreement implies that the Deutsche Bundesbank (the central bank) stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. On December 31, 1987 these rates were as follows: Specified Intervention Rates per: Deutsche Mark Upper limit2 Lower limit2 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 100 Danish kroner 100 French francs 1 Irish pound 1,000 Italian lire 100 Netherlands guilders 4.740 25.630 29.150 2.619 1.3065 86.780 4.959 26.810 30.495 2.740 1.4735 90.770 The participants in the EMS do not maintain the exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits, but, in order to ensure a proper functioning of the EMS, they intervene in concert with other participants in the EMS to smooth out erratic fluctuations in exchange rates. In principle, interventions are made in participating cur- rencies, but they may also take place in third currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. Official middle, buying, and selling rates are quoted for 17 foreign currencies on the foreign exchange market of Frankfurt am Main.3 On December 31, 1987 the official middle rate for the U.S. dollar was DM 1.5815 per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange.

There are no officially fixed rates in the forward exchange market, and all transactions are negotiated at free market rates. Germany formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Administration of Control The administration of control in respect of imports and exports of goods and services is operated by the Federal Ministry of Economics, the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Federal Ministry of Transportation, the Federal Office for Economics, the Federal Ministry for Food, Agricul- ture, and Forestry, the Federal Office for Food and Forestry, the Federal Office for Agricultural Marketing Organization, and the Ministries of Economics of the Laender. All banks in Germany are permitted to carry out foreign exchange transactions. Imports and Import Payments The Import List comprises a total of 9,172 statistical positions. Their treatment is as follows: Commodities corresponding to some 120 positions are subject to import licensing when being imported from countries in Country List C.4 The import of some 600 textile items (under the arrangements regarding international trade in textiles) and of certain steel items is governed by bilateral agreements of the European Economic Community (EEC) with var- ious supplier countries. Imports of coal from countries that are not members of the European Coal and Steel Commun i ty (ECSC) and from Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland are permitted within the framework of an annual global quota. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Communities (EC) covers about 1,700 statistical items; most of these are subject to variable import levies, which in most cases have replaced previous barriers to imports. Payments for imports are unrestricted. Commodity futures may be dealt in freely. Most transit trade trans- actions may also be carried out freely. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles may be made freely without individual license. German and foreign notes and coin and other means of payment may be exported freely. The following transactions —but not the related pay- ments —between residents and nonresidents are subject to restriction: the chartering of foreign ships from resi- 4 Countries in List C are Albania, member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Not for Redistribution FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY dents of specified countries and the conclusion of related sea freight contracts; the use of foreign boats in certain inland waterway traffic; and transactions with specified countries (which do not grant reciprocal treatment) for hull and marine liability insurance and aviation insurance, except passenger accident insurance. Exports and Export Proceeds With few exceptions, export transactions may be car- ried out freely. For statistical purposes, an export noti- fication is required for all goods. Certain exports (mostly strategic goods) are subject to individual licensing. The customs authorities exercise control over export decla- rations. Foreign exchange proceeds from exports do not have to be declared or surrendered, and they may be used for all payments. Proceeds from Invisibles With few exceptions, services performed for nonresi- dents do not require licenses. However, licenses are required for transactions related to specific sea services and for technical assistance through the delivery of constructional drawings, materials, and instructions for manufacture to residents of List C countries (see footnote 4), if such assistance is for the production of goods whose export requires a license. There are no restrictions on the receipt of payments for services rendered to nonresidents; however, receipts exceeding DM 2,000 on account of services have to be reported for statistical purposes. German and foreign notes and coin and other means of payment may be imported freely. Capital Residents and nonresidents may export capital freely without a license. Foreign and international bond issues on the German capital market do not require official approval. All resident banks, including legally independ- ent foreign-owned banks, may lead-manage issues of foreign bonds denominated in deutsche mark; the right of foreign-owned banks to lead-manage foreign deutsche mark bond issues is contingent, however, on reciprocal lead-management rights of German-owned banks in the home countries of the foreign-owned banks operating in Germany. Domestic and foreign securities of all types may be imported or exported freely. Following the changes in regulations beginning March 12, 1981, no restrictions are applied on the sale of German money market papers and fixed interest securities by residents to nonresidents. Nonresidents' direct invest- ments in Germany, purchases of real estate in Germany for investment or personal use, and purchases of German or foreign equities do not require approval. There are no limitations on the disposal of legacies located in Germany and inherited by nonresidents or on legacies located abroad and inherited by residents. Residents are not required to repatriate or surrender their foreign exchange earnings or holdings. 220 Banks are subject to m in imum reserve requirements on the level of their foreign liabilities with maturities of less than four years; the minimum reserve ratios at the end of 1987 were, in principle, the same as those applicable to domestic liabilities, that is, 12.1 percent, 4.95 percent, and 4.15 percent on demand, time, and savings deposits, respectively. The principal exemption is for banks' foreign currency borrowings that are reinvested abroad. Banks are free to pay interest on domestic or foreign currency balances held by nonresidents. Gold Residents may freely hold gold in any form at home or abroad and may negotiate gold in any form with residents or nonresidents, at home or abroad. There is a free gold market in Frankfurt. Imports and exports of gold in any form by residents and nonresidents are unrestricted and free of license; a customs declaration, however, is required. Imports of gold bullion and coin, unworked gold, and gold alloys are free of customs du ty but are subject to value-added tax at a rate of 14 percent. In the case of imports of gold coin where the assessment basis exceeds 250 percent of the fine gold value, the value-added tax is levied at a rate of 7 percent. Imports of monetary gold by the Bundesbank are exempt from value-added tax and from customs du ty. Domestic transactions in gold are subject to value-added tax at the same rate as imports, but under certain conditions no value-added tax is levied on transactions in gold bullion effected on gold exchanges between brokers who are admitted to these exchanges. Commercial imports and exports of articles containing gold are subject to the general foreign trade regulations and in all cases are liberalized. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 12.

All foreign exchange transactions through the official banking system are settled in accordance with the exchange rate deter- mined in auction which is held once a week (on Friday). To be eligible for the auction, bids must be above US$500. Rates are quoted for certain other currencies,1 with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad.2 Rates for certain incon- vertible currencies of the West African region, including the Nigerian naira, are also quoted daily, but are only applied to transactions under the West African Clearing House arrangement. The other quoted inconvertible cur- rencies are the Gambian dalasi, the Guinean syli, the Sierra Leonean leone, the Guinea-Bissau peso, and the Mauritanian ouguiya. The authorized banks may exchange Ghanaian currency for any foreign currency. On Decem- ber 31, 1987 the exchange rate in the auction market was C176 = US$1. A processing fee of 5 percent is levied on purchases and repurchases of foreign exchange related to travel, and on exchange purchases for education, medical treat- ment abroad, and private outward transfers. There are no arrangements for forward exchange market, currency swaps, or guaranteed exchange rates for external debt service payments. Administration of Control The Controller of Imports and Exports at the Ministry of Trade is empowered to prohibit, regulate, or license all imports. Prior to the change in the licensing system on October 6, 1986, applications by the industrial sector and certain state agencies for individual import licenses had to be channeled through the appropriate ministry or government agency for endorsement. The Controller of Imports and Exports issued import licenses on the basis of an annual import program formulated and implemented by the Import Programming and Monitoring Committee (IPMC), comprising the Secretaries of Finance and Eco- nomic Planning, Industries, Agriculture, Trade, and Health, and the Governor of the Bank of Ghana, with the Coordinating Secretary as Chairman. Following the introduction of the foreign exchange auction system in September 1986, the licensing system 1 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dol- lars, CFA francs, Danish kroner, French francs, deutsche mark, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, New Zealand dollars, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 2 With effect from February 1, 1988 foreign exchange bureaus were allowed to be opened by any person, bank, or institution licensed by the Bank of Ghana. Each foreign exchange bureau may only purchase traveler's checks in pounds sterling and U.S. dollars, but may purchase and sell currency notes in Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French (and CFA) francs, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. Each foreign exchange bureau is free to quote buying and selling rates. 222 was modified. Under the new system, three categories of licenses known as "A," "S," and "G" licenses are issued. (See section on Imports and Import Payments, below.) Applications for "A" and "S" licenses must be submitted directly to the Ministry of Trade and Tourism. These licenses are valid for a period of six months. The "A" license permits the holder to bid for foreign exchange through the foreign exchange auction system and is issued for the importation of consumer and producer goods (i.e., raw materials, spare parts, capital goods, and intermediate goods). The "S" license allows the holder to use his own foreign exchange resources to import goods. Government organizations may apply for "G" licenses, but must submit their application to the Ministry of Trade and Tourism through their sector ministries as under the annual import programming. After the import program has been approved by the IPMC, the government orga- nizations are allocated "G" licenses directly by the Government. This license permits government organiza- tions to use foreign exchange directly allocated by the Government outside the auction for the importation of goods and services. The "G" licenses are valid for a period of 12 months. The Exchange Control Department of the Bank of Ghana administers the allocation of exchange for payments for invisibles and capital. Per- mitted foreign exchange transactions must be made through authorized banks. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Settlements between residents of Ghana and residents of other countries may be made in permitted currencies. However, settlements related to transactions covered by bilateral paymen ts agreements are made through clearing accounts maintained by the Bank of Ghana and the central or state banks of the countries concerned.3 Furthermore, proceeds from exports to countries with which Ghana does not have bilateral payments agreements must be received in the currency of the importing country (if that currency is among the currencies quoted by the Bank of Ghana) or in deutsche mark, pounds sterling, or U.S. dollars. Current payments to or from the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Ni- geria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Convertible foreign currency accounts may be opened by resident and nonresident Ghanaians as well as non- Ghanaians at authorized foreign exchange dealer banks. Such accounts may be credited with foreign exchange 3 Ghana maintains operative bilateral payments arrangements with Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, the German Democratic Re- public, Romania, and Yugoslavia. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution earnings from all sources, other than exports of goods and services originating from Ghana, agency commis- sions, and discounts on imports into Ghana. Outward transfers of funds from these accounts do not require the approval of the Bank of Ghana. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident account status is granted to embassies, legations, consulates, and offices of high commissioners in Ghana and to the non-Ghanaian members of their staffs. This facility is also available to international institutions and foreign-registered companies operating in Ghana, as well as to nonresident Ghanaians. The opening of these accounts is subject to approval by the Bank of Ghana. The accounts may be credited with authorized outward payments, with transfers from other Foreign Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of convertible currency. They may be debited for inward payments, for transfers to other Foreign Accounts, and for purchases of external currencies. Nonresident accounts maintained under the provisions of bilateral payments agreements are called "Official Accounts" or 'Territorial Accounts." These accounts may be credited with authorized outward payments by residents, with transfers from Foreign Accounts, with payments received through the Bank of Ghana for settle- ments with bilateral payments agreement countries, and with proceeds from sales of external currencies, other than restricted currencies. They may be debited for authorized inward payments to residents of Ghana, for transfers to other Official Accounts related to the same country, and for transfers to the related clearing account at the Bank of Ghana. Funds not placed at the free disposal of nonresidents — for example, certain types of capital proceeds —may be deposited in Blocked Accounts. These accounts may be debited for authorized payments, including the purchase of approved securities. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Namibia (South West Africa) and South Africa are prohibited. Three types of import licenses— "A," "S," and "G"—are issued. "A" licenses, which permit the holder to bid for foreign exchange in foreign exchange auctions, are issued solely for the importation of consumer and producer goods (i.e., raw materials, spare parts, capital goods, and general intermediate goods). A license fee of 0.5 percent of the value of license is charged for each "A" license. "A" licenses are issued to all applicants, provided that they fulfill statutory obligations necessary for obtaining import licenses; in particular, companies must possess a valid Tax Clearance Certificate and be current in their social security contributions. "S" licenses are issued for the importation of all goods, except for prohibited goods and for goods on a negative list comprising beer and stout, cigarettes, asbestos or fiber cement roofing sheets, and asbestos or fiber cement pipes. Foreign exchange to cover imports under "S" GHANA licenses are not provided from the banking system; such imports must be covered with the importers' own foreign exchange resources. A 20 percent advanced income tax must be paid before an "S" license can be obtained, except for applicants who are assessed to be in good standing with the tax authorities and for importers who produce agriculture-related products. "G" licenses are issued to government organizations for the importation of essential goods and services. Foreign exchange to cover imports under "G" licenses is provided by the Bank of Ghana. Certain imports are channeled through a bulk purchasing agent, the Ghana National Procurement Agency, or, for public sector im- ports, the Ghana Supply Commission. Except for aid imports, import licenses do not specify the country from which the product has to be imported. Licenses for payment in inconvertible currencies may be used for imports from any bilateral payments agreement country. Licenses are issued on a c. & f. basis and are endorsed to the effect that insurance must be covered in Ghana. Most imports are effected with confirmed letters of credit established through Ghanaian banks, and usually on a sight basis. For imports valued at over US$2,000 f.o.b., banks are forbidden to make payments against a letter of credit or a bank draft unless the import documents include a clean report of findings issued by international agencies, which inspect the goods and verify the price, quality, and quantity in the country of origin or shipment. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require specific approval of the Exchange Control Department of the Bank of Ghana, and documentary evidence must support all applications. Most foreign exchange purchases for invisible payments are subject to a processing fee of 5 percent ad valorem, with the exception of invisible payments relating to imports. Transfers of normal bank charges payable to overseas bankers for import payments are generally authorized. The payment of buying commissions on imports is per- mitted within a limit of 3 percent of f.o.b. value. Freight charges may be paid to the local shipping agents; the transfer of funds to cover such charges is normally permitted, provided that the application is properly doc- umented. With few exceptions, insurance on all imports shipped to Ghana on f.o.b. or c. & f. terms must be arranged in Ghanaian currency with local insurance companies. Remittances of income by non-Ghanaian employees and self-employed persons are normally limited to 40 percent of their net annual earnings, up to a maximum of US$2,600 a year, plus leave pay; this personal remit- tance quota is intended to cover all personal and family requirements and commitments outside Ghana, including leave expenses, travel, education, insurance premiums, and subscriptions. Employees in the mining, timber, fishing, petroleum, and banking industries are, however, offered a choice between two alternative facilities. Under one of these, they are allowed to transfer 40 percent of 223 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GHANA their net annual earnings, up to a maximum of US$2,600 a year, plus leave pay and the balance on their savings at the end of their tour of duty. Under the other facility, when documentary evidence of their commitments outside Ghana can be produced in support of their applications, employees can transfer up to 70 percent of their net annual earnings and the balance on their savings at the end of their tour of duty. With the exception of companies financed with locally raised capital, nonresident compa- nies are, in principle, permitted to transfer abroad freely their net profits after tax; at present, however, transfers of profits are being authorized only on a limited basis. The transfer of profits by companies that have been financed with locally raised capital is not permitted. Foreign exchange is not provided for tourist travel, and foreign exchange for business travel is granted only in exceptional cases, with per diem allowances determined on a case-by-case basis. Resident travelers may take with them foreign currency notes equivalent to C 160, provided that not more than the equivalent of C 40 is taken in any one currency. Ghanaian bank notes up toC40 may be taken out by any traveler. Nonresident travelers may take out any unutil- ized foreign currency brought in and declared upon en try. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Namibia (South West Africa) and South Africa are prohibited. Exports of iron and steel scrap also are prohibited. Cocoa and certain other agricultural products are exported through the Cocoa Board, and diamonds are exported through the Diamond Marketing Corporation. Normally, specific export licenses are re- quired. Exports of bauxite, gold, manganese, and timber are subject to a 6 percent export tax; for cocoa, the export tax is the difference between export proceeds, on the one hand, and payments to farmers together with operational costs, on the other, if the proceeds exceed the payments. With the exceptions noted below, exporters are required to collect and repatriate in full the proceeds from their exports within 60 days of shipment; proceeds from exports of nontraditional products must be surrendered to a commercial bank in Ghana upon receipt. Exporters are generally allowed to retain up to 35 percent of their export proceeds in accounts abroad for financing essential im- ports. However, the retention ratio is 45 percent for the Ashanti Gold Mining Company, 20 percent for log ex- porters, and 2 percent for the Cocoa Board. The retention scheme does not apply to exports of residual oil and electricity. However, receipts from the export of elec- tricity are not required to be surrendered to the Bank of Ghana. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be sold to authorized dealers. Foreign currency notes may be imported freely. Repurchases of foreign exchange acquired for the purpose of foreign travel are subject to a processing fee of 224 5 percent. The import of Ghanaian currency notes in excess ofC40 is prohibited. Capital Foreign investments in Ghana require prior approval by the Ghana Inves tment Center if they are to benefit from the facilities available under the Investment Code. Under the Investment Code of 1981, approved invest- ments are guaranteed, in principle, the right to transfer profits and, in the event of sale or liquidation, capital proceeds; tax holidays, initial capital allowances, etc., are also available for such investments. The Code stip- ulates that the assets of foreign investors may not be expropriated. Where there is a dispute over the amount of compensation, the dispute is settled in accordance with the established procedure for conciliation —for example, through arbitration by the International Center for Set- tlements of Investment Disputes or the United Nations Commission on International Trade and Law. Certain areas of economic activity are not open to foreigners. The proceeds of the sales of foreign ownership to Gha- naian nationals are held in blocked, non-interest-bearing accounts with the Bank of Ghana; these accounts carry an exchange rate guarantee. Transfers of such funds are being effected gradually. Under a supplementary Investment Code issued in July 1985, incentives are provided aimed at promoting foreign investments that promise to be net foreign exchange earners. The main features of the 1981 and 1985 Codes, which offer incentives and guarantees to encourage for- eign investments in areas other than petroleum and mining (already covered by a Minerals Code), are as follows: (1) exemption from customs duties in respect of importation of plant, machinery, and equipment; (2) more favorable depreciation or capital allowances; (3) permission to operate an external account in which at least 25 percent of the investing company's foreign exchange earnings may be retained for procuring machinery and equipment, spare parts, and raw materials, for servicing of debt, and for transfers of dividends and profits; (4) guarantee for the remittance of foreign capital in the event of sale or liquidation; and (5) protection against expropriation. The m in imum requirement of investment capital to qualify under the Codes is US$60,000 for joint ventures with a Ghanaian partner and US$100,000 for enterprises that are wholly foreign owned. All outgoing capital movements must be approved by the Bank of Ghana; applications for such transfers must be supported by documentary evidence and are consid- ered on their merits. Transfers to beneficiaries under wills and intestacies are approved, provided that all local indebtedness has been settled. Requests for the transfer of funds representing personal assets of foreign residents in Ghana who emigrate are considered individually on their merits. Applications must be supported by appro- priate documentation showing that the savings are genuine and that no illegal transfer of capital is involved. Proceeds from the liquidation of the real assets of foreign nationals leaving Ghana may be approved for transfer in one lump ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution sum or may be spread over a period of time, depending on the amount. Loan and overdraft facilities to resident companies controlled by nonresidents require the individual approval of the Bank of Ghana. Residents who are private persons are not normally granted foreign exchange for the acqui- sition of securities or personal real estate abroad. Trans- actions in securities are controlled to ensure that capital is not transferred abroad. In respect of portfolio invest- ments, residents must obtain approval for any switch in their holdings of securities issued by nonresidents. Private sector and commercial bank borrowing require the ap- proval of the Bank of Ghana, as do private import credits for machinery and equipment valued at US$100,000 or more; foreign borrowing by Ghanaian nationals is subject to certain guidelines by the Government. Lending to nonresidents is prohibited, except for export credits; these require exchange control approval, and normally are limited to 60 days. Under a system of external accounts for debt service payments introduced in 1980 to enable export-oriented industries to get external aid, such industries are allowed to operate foreign exchange accounts (in addition to their regular retention accounts) with funds earmarked from export earnings for the purpose of debt service payments. The opening of such accounts requires the approval of the Committee on Suppliers' Credit and the Exchange Control Department of the Bank of Ghana; the latter also monitors the receipts and payments out of these accounts. GHANA Such accounts have been established for the diamond sector as well as for the fishing and timber companies financed with suppliers' credits. Gold Domestic transactions in gold, as well as imports and exports, may be authorized by the State Gold Mining Corporation in collaboration with the Bank of Ghana, and certain domestic sales may be carried out by permit under the Gold Mining Products Protection Ordinance. With these exceptions, Ghanaian residents may not buy or borrow any gold from, or sell or lend any gold to, any person other than an authorized dealer. Imports of gold other than those by or on behalf of the monetary author- ities are not normally licensed. The import duty on bullion, partly worked gold, and other gold is levied at a uniform rate of 30 percent. The gold mines export their output in semirefined form.

Not for Redistribution GREECE (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Greece is the Greek Drachma. The authorities of Greece operate a managed float for the drachma. On December 31, 1987 buying and selling rates in the interbank market were Dr 125.47 and Dr 126.303, respectively, per US$1, which is the intervention cur- rency. Exchange rates for the U.S. dollar and other currencies1 are determined during the daily fixing session, in which the Bank of Greece (the central bank) and the authorized commercial banks participate. In the domestic spot exchange market, the commercial banks quote their own rates. The commercial banks may levy a commission on all foreign exchange transactions in the domestic forward exchange market. The rates applied by the commercial banks are based on those determined daily by the Bank of Greece. Forward cover is extended only to commercial transactions carried out by residents for a maturity period of up to 3 months for imports and 12 months for exports. Forward rates are also quoted to nonresident banks, provided that relevant contracts in- volve a foreign currency against convertible drachmas for a maturity period of up to three months. Exchange risk is undertaken by the Bank of Greece. Greece is a member of the European Monetary System (EMS). The drachma is included in the European Cur- rency Unit (ECU) basket, but does not participate in the exchange rate mechanism. Administration of Control Exchange control is the responsibility of the Bank of Greece. The Ministry of Trade is responsible for the policy concerning commodity imports and exports. The commercial banks are authorized to carry out all the necessary formalities for the settlement of imports and exports. In almost all cases, they automatically grant approval for imports and prepare the documentation for exports according to exchange regulations. The commer- cial banks are also authorized to undertake transactions in foreign exchange for invisibles and capital. Prescription of Currency Settlements with all countries may be made in any convertible foreign currency or through deposit accounts in convertible drachmas.

Interest rates on these deposits are freely negotiable, but within limits according to maturity, with a maximum of 8 percent a year. Principal and interest are freely transferable at maturity. 2. Deposit Accounts in Foreign Exchange. Nonresi- dents are permitted to open sight and time deposit accounts in foreign exchange. These deposits may be credited with: (1) imported foreign exchange; (2) nonres- idents' demands in foreign exchange for imports of goods and services in Greece; (3) transfers from similar nonres- ident accounts; and (4) accrued interest on these deposits. They may be debited with: (1) payments to residents for exports of goods and services; (2) investments in Greece; (3) transfers to similar nonresident accounts; and (4) transfers abroad. The interest rate on sight deposits is 1.5 percent a year. This interest rate is freely negotiable when beneficiaries are international organizations in which Greece partici- pates. Time deposits may be for a term of one day and over, with freely negotiable interest rates. 3. Deposit Accounts in Convertible Drachmas. Non- residents may open sight and time deposit accounts in convertible drachmas. These deposits may be credited with: (1) the drachma proceeds from imported foreign exchange; (2) nonresidents' demands in foreign exchange or convertible drachmas for imports of goods and services in Greece; (3) transfers from similar nonresident accounts; and (4) accrued interest on these deposits. They may be debited with: (1) payments to residents for exports of goods and services; (2) inves tmen ts and other payments in Greece; (3) transfers to similar nonresident accounts; and (4) transfers abroad after conversion of drachmas into foreign exchange. The interest rate on sight deposits is 1.5 percent a year, whereas the interest rates on time deposits for a period of up to six months is freely negotiable. Banks operating in Greece are allowed to lend to credit institutions abroad in convertible drachmas in amounts not exceeding the banks' total deposits in convertible drachmas; the maturity of such loans can be up to six mon ths and the interest rate is freely negotiable. Banks are also allowed to purchase forward or sell forward foreign exchange from or to credit institutions abroad against convertible drachmas for maturity periods of one, two, and three months. 4.

Should the depositor decide at the time of deposit to withdraw accrued interest in drachmas, the annual interest rate is raised by 1.5 percentage points. Holders of time deposit accounts with mortgage banks are entitled to obtain loans for inves tment in real estate, depending on the maturity of the deposit up to a max imum limit of Dr 5 million. 5. Blocked Accounts. Claims of non-EC (European Communities) residents denominated in drachmas that are enforceable in Greece and do not derive from imported foreign currency must be deposited in Blocked Accounts. Withdrawal of f u n ds from these accounts is pe rm i t ted, after approval of the Bank of Greece, for various purposes, such as: (1) l iv ing expenses in Greece of the account holder and his fam i ly; (2) expenses for buy ing t icke ts for each visit to Greece by the account holder himself and his fam i ly; (3) expenses for paying taxes and law- yers' fees; (4) expenses for the maintenance of real estate; and (5) inve s tmen ts in securities off ic ia l ly listed on the A thens Stock Exchange and purchase of real estate in Greece. Payments abroad from these accounts are allowed, after approval of the Bank of Greece, as follows: (1) max imum amount of US$2,000 per year from deposits made exclusively with rental income; (2) maximum amount of US$4,200 per year from deposits made exclusively with pensions and provided that the holder of the account took residence abroad before January 1, 1982; (3) to meet various family obligations, such as hospital and medical expenses and expenses for the elderly; (4) compensations paid to war victims by foreign states; (5) foreign consult- ants' fees, compensations for accidents, etc.; (6) dividends from postwar government loans and loans of public sector organizations listed on the A thens Stock Exchange; and (7) dividends from shares listed on the A thens Stock Exchange, up to 6 percent of their stock exchange value but not exceeding Dr 150,000 a year. Blocked Accounts earn the interest rate applicable to savings deposits, which is currently 15 percent per annum. Domestic bank notes in excess of Dr 25,000 brought in by nonresident travelers or Dr 10,000 brought in by Greek residents must be declared upon en try and are blocked at the Bank of Greece; subject to prior approval by the Bank, the excess amount may be taken out on departure or be spent in Greece to meet personal needs. Resident Accounts Residents of Greece and nonprofit legal entities under private law having head offices in Greece may open deposit accounts in foreign exchange with funds from abroad, without stating their origin. These could be either sight or time deposits for up to 12 mon ths. If the deposited GREECE amounts are up to the equivalent of US$50,000, the interest rates are determined by the Bank of Greece on the basis of the rates prevailing in international money markets; otherwise, they are freely negotiable. In case foreign exchange is earned as salary from working abroad, as payment for services performed outside Greece, or as payment from other sources (such as legacies and dow- ries), the interest rate and other terms of deposits are the same as those applicable to Nonresident Account Deposits in Foreign Exchange (2 above). Imports and Import Payments Approval for imports is granted automatically by the commercial banks, and it implies that the required amount of foreign exchange will be made available. Import ap- provals may be obtained after shipment has taken place. Special import licenses are required for commodities on Lists A and B (i.e., textiles and iron and steel products), which come from low-cost countries; these commodities are under surveillance according to EC quotas. Settlement of the value of imported goods must take place within 60 days of the date of arrival at the first Greek port. Special regulations govern imports of certain items, such as medicines, narcotics, and motion picture films. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are granted automatically for expenses incidental to authorized transactions. Residents traveling abroad for family reasons or tourism are entitled once a year to the equivalent of ECU 8002 for travel to EC countries and Cyprus, or the equivalent of US$600 for travel to all other countries. In addition to this allowance, travelers participating in group tours are granted an amount based on a cost declaration submitted by the travel agency. Travelers may also take with them a maximum of Dr 10,000 in Greek bank notes. Greek residents are required to declare all foreign bank notes in excess of the permitted amount and other valuables taken with them when leaving Greece. Foreign exchange for business travel is granted without restriction on the number of trips to be taken in a year. For medical treatment abroad, the necessary amounts in foreign exchange are made available, provided the rele- vant documentation for the expenses is submitted. For undergraduate and graduate studies abroad, various amounts covering living expenses are granted, depending on the country of study. In addition, foreign exchange is granted to cover tuition fees, books, etc. Nonresidents leaving Greece may take out foreign bank notes up to the equivalent of US$1,000 within a year after their arrival in Greece, as well as travelers' checks and other means of payment in their name irrespective of amoun t; they may also take out Dr 10,000 in Greek bank notes. Larger amounts in foreign bank notes can be taken out not later than December 31 of the calendar year following the year in which the nonresident entered 2 E f fec t ive January 1, 1988, the amount was increased to ECU 840. 227 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GREECE Greece, provided that they were declared upon entry into Greece. Payments of interest, profits, and dividends are gov- erned by the regulations that are applied to capital transfers to Greece (see section on Capital, below). Foreign banks operating in Greece are permitted to repatriate their profits, irrespective of the nature of their operations. Exports and Export Proceeds Export proceeds must be surrendered w i th in 90 days of the date of shipment of the goods. In special cases, the authorities may extend this time limit by approving time settlement of the value of exports. Industrial ex- porters can obtain subsidies in the form of interest rebates on loans3 and income tax deductions. A general subsidy equivalent to 3 percent of the drachma value of export earnings is paid when export earnings are surrendered.4 Export goods are not subject to the value-added tax. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange earnings representing payments for services must be surrendered w i th in 45 days of the date of receipt. Earnings from shipping are exempt from the surrender requirements, but shipowners must cover their disbursements and expenses in Greece by converting foreign exchange earnings into drachmas. Greek residents may bring in any amount of foreign exchange, but must declare it upon entry if they wish to take it out on their next departure; they may also bring in a maximum of Dr 10,000 in bank notes. Nonresident travelers may import any amount of foreign currency and need not declare it, provided they do not intend to take out amounts in excess of the equivalent of US$1,000. Traveler's checks and other means of payment in a traveler's name are not subject to a limit. Travelers may also bring in a maximum of Dr 25,000 in Greek bank notes. Capital Capital movements between Greece and other EC countries are covered by the provisions of Presidential Decree 207/1987, which allows repatriation of the capital (as well as rents, profits, dividends, and capital gains) imported into Greece for the purpose of direct inves tmen t, inves tment in real estate, or purchase of securities. Direct investments in Greece by non-EC residents are covered by Act 825/1986 of the Governor of the Bank of Greece. The Act provides for the repatriation of the related interest and dividend income and also, after a three-year period, of the liquidation proceeds. Non-EC residents of Greek origin are permitted to repatriate the liquidation proceeds of inves tmen ts in real estate, provided that five years have passed from the time of conversion of imported foreign exchange into drachmas. Direct investments abroad by residents of Greece require specific approval. 3 These rebates will be gradually eliminated by Janua ry 1, 1990 for exports to EC countries and by 1992 for exports to non-EC coun tr ies. 4 This subsidy was eliminated as of January 1, 1988. 228 Bank loans to manufacturing, mining, and hotel enter- prises are allowed w i thout prior approval of the Bank of Greece, provided the maturity of the loans is not less than six months. Bank and nonbank loans from abroad, which do not fall under the previous category and do not qualify as direct investment, are subject to prior approval. Transfers abroad of the liquidation proceeds of listed securities, as well as Treasury bills and long-term gov- ernment bonds and bonds of public sector entities are permitted; for other categories of capital (e.g., purchase of unlisted securities), repatriation is not normally permitted. Legislative Decree 2687/1953 is in force in respect of cases that are not covered by the provisions of Presidential Decree or by Acts of the Governor of the Bank of Greece. Gold Residents may freely purchase new gold sovereigns from the Bank of Greece through licensed stockbrokers at a price set by the Bank of Greece. These gold coins may be resold only to the Bank of Greece or to the Athens Stock Exchange. Holders of gold coins acquired in the free market that existed prior to December 22, 1965 may sell them without any formality to the Bank of Greece or to an authorized bank at the official price. Imports of gold against payment in foreign exchange are on Import List F and require a special license; licenses are normally issued to importers for distribution to jewelers and den- tists. Gold bars and gold coins may be imported for other than commercial purposes when no payment in foreign exchange is invo lved. Exports of gold other than by the Bank of Greece are not approved except when gold bars or coins are brought in by travelers and declared upon en t ry, in which case they may be exported after approval of the Bank of Greece. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement June 10. The Bank of Greece announced that it would withdraw from the in terbank foreign exchange market, and that it would quote the exchange rate against the U .S. dollar at the opening and closing of the market. The Bank of Greece, however, would remain free to intervene during the day and at the daily fixing. As from Janu- ary 18, 1988, the Bank of Greece discontinued quoting rates daily at the opening of the market. Imports and Import Payments February 1. The rates of the advance import deposit scheme were halved to 20 percent and 40 percent (de- pending on the commodity) of the c.i.f. value of the imports concerned. March 1.

Not for Redistribution Payments for Invisibles January 1. The allowance for travel to EC countries by residents was raised from ECU 760 to ECU 800 per annum. March 4. Foreign banks operating in Greece were permitted to remit their profits; previously, profit remit- tances had been restricted to net revenues from offshore businesses. Exports and Export Proceeds January 1.

Manufacturing, mining, and hotel enterprises GREECE were allowed under Act 1011/87 of the Governor of the Bank of Greece to borrow in foreign currency from domestic and foreign credit institutions without prior approval of the Bank of Greece, provided that funds are borrowed for a minimum of six months and are to be used for investment and working capital purposes. September 25. Borrowings by manufacturing, mining, and hotel enterprises under Act 1153/87 of the Governor of the Bank of Greece were allowed to dispose freely the proceeds of such borrowings abroad to cover: (1) servicing of loans in foreign currency contracted at an earlier date; (2) payments of the value of machinery and raw materials; and (3) payments for the acquisition of technical know- how. Also, these enterprises were allowed to contract loans in the form of open credit for a minimum of six months, to cover operational financing needs. November 11. Repatriation of capital and profit remit- tances in respect of borrowings from non-EC countries were permitted, if they were used for purchases of securities listed in the Athens Stock Exchange. 229 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GRENADA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Grenada is the Eastern Caribbean Dollar,1 which is issued by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB). The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at EC$2.70 = US$1. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar quoted by the ECCB in its transactions with commercial banks were EC$2.69 and EC$2.71, respectively, per US$1. The ECCB also quotes daily rates for the Canadian dollar and the pound sterling. An exchange tax of 5 percent is levied on all sales of foreign exchange by commercial banks, except for pay- ments for imports of some basic foods and drugs, and remittances to cover the expenses of university education abroad. Administration of Control Exchange control applies to all countries. It is admin- istered by the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry delegates to authorized dealers the authority to approve some import payments and certain other outward payments. The ex- change control directives do not apply to transactions with South Africa. Trade controls are also administered by the Trade Division of the Ministry of Finance. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Settlements with residents of member countries of the Caribbean Common Market (CARicoM)2 must be made either through External Accounts (in Eastern Caribbean dollars) or in the currency of the CARICOM country concerned. Settlements with residents of the former Sterling Area countries, other than CARICOM countries, may be made in pounds sterling, in any other former Sterling Area currency, or in Eastern Caribbean dollars to and from External Accounts. Settlements with residents of countries outside the former Sterling Area other than South Africa may be made in any foreign currency3 or through an External Account in Eastern Caribbean dollars. Nonresident Accounts External Accounts may be opened for nonresidents by authorized dealers without reference to the Ministry of Finance. These accounts are maintained in Eastern Ca- ribbean dollars. They may be credited with proceeds from the sale of foreign currencies, with transfers from other 1 The Eastern Caribbean dollar is also the currency of Angu i l la, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nev is, and St. Lucia. 2 The CARICOM countries are Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. K i t ts and Nev is, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 3 Foreign currencies include all currencies other than the Eastern Caribbean dollar. 230 External Accounts, with bank interest (payable on Ex- ternal Accounts), and with paymen ts by residents for which general or specific permission has been given by the Ministry. They may be debited for paymen ts to residents of Grenada, for the cost of foreign exchange required for travel or business purposes, and for any other payments covered by delegated authority to au- thorized dealers. Other debits and any overdrafts require individual approval. Foreign Currency Accounts Residents and nonresidents are permitted to open foreign currency accounts without referring to the Min- istry of Finance. Such accounts may be freely debited, but can be credited only w i th foreign exchange earned or received from outside the ECCB area. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. Most goods may be freely imported. Certain other commodities are subject to quantitative restrictions and require an import license. Payments for documented imports are free of restric- tions. Payments for other authorized imports are permit- ted upon application and submission of documentary evidence (invoices and customs warrants) to the Ministry of Finance. Advance payments for imports also require prior approval by this Ministry. Imports of equipment and spare parts are exempted from import duties. Also exempted are imports by the commodity associations in cases where imports are in- tended for quality improvements in the growing or pack- aging of bananas, cocoa, and nutmeg. Imports not exempt from customs du ty are subject to a value-added tax of 20 percent of c.i.f. value, with the exception of imports of raw materials for use in local manufacturing of finished products, which are subject to an 8 percent value-added tax. Payments for Invisibles With the exception of outward remittances for educa- tion, medical trea tmen t, gifts, family maintenance, profits, dividends, insurance premia, proceeds from sales of local property, royalties, and management fees, payments for invisibles require exchange control approval. Authority has been delegated to authorized dealers to provide basic allocations of foreign exchange for a few types of pay- ments. These include foreign travel (for which up to EC$5,000 a person a calendar year may be allocated for private travel and up to EC$10,000 a person for business travel), subscriptions to magazines and periodicals, and life insurance premia on policies contracted before June 1975. With the exception of tourism, applications for additional amounts or for purposes for which there is no basic allocation normally are approved by the Ministry ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution of Finance, provided that no unauthorized transfer of capital is involved. Applications in respect of tourism in excess of EC$5,000 a person are considered on their merits. The cost of transportation to any destination may be settled in domestic currency and is not deducted from the travel allocation. Nonresident travelers may export any foreign currency previously brought in with the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited, and specific licenses are required for the export of certain goods to any destination. There are no formal regulations to ensure that export proceeds in foreign currencies are surrendered within a certain period from the date of sh ipmen t, but the collection of export proceeds is mandatory. Proceeds from Invisibles The collection of the foreign currency proceeds from invisibles is mandatory. Travelers may bring in freely notes and coin in Eastern Caribbean currency or in any foreign currency. Capital All outward capital transfers require exchange control approval. The purchase by residents of foreign currency securities and of real estate abroad for private purposes is not normally permitted. Certificates of title to foreign currency securities held by residents must be lodged with an authorized depository in Grenada, and earnings on these securities must be repatriated. Personal capital transfers, such as inheritances to non- residents, require exchange control approval, which nor- mally is granted subject to the payment of estate and succession duties. There are certain allowances for cash gifts (EC$500 a person a year) and for emigration pur- poses. The Ministry of Finance will also consider transfer applications from foreign nationals who have resided in Grenada and are proceeding to take up permanent resi- dence abroad. Direct investment in Grenada by nonresidents may be made with exchange control approval. The remittance of earnings on, and liquidation proceeds from, such invest- ment is permitted, provided that all liabilities related to GRENADA the investment have been discharged and that the original investment was registered with the Ministry of Finance. Nonresidents may acquire in Grenada real estate for private purposes with funds in foreign currency; local currency financing is not ordinarily permitted. The re- patriation of the proceeds from the realization of such investments requires the approval of the Ministry of Finance. The approval of the Ministry of Finance is required for residents to borrow abroad or for nonresidents to borrow in Grenada. Authorized dealers may freely assume short- term liability positions in foreign currencies for the fi- nancing of approved transfers in respect of both trade and nontrade transactions. They may also freely accept deposits from nonresidents. Any borrowing abroad by authorized dealers to finance their domestic operations requires the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Gold Residents other than the monetary authorities, autho- rized dealers, and industrial users are not permitted to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry or coins for numismatic purposes. Imports of gold are permitted for industrial purposes only and are subject to customs duties and charges. Licenses to import gold are issued by the Ministry of Finance. The export of gold is not normally permitted. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement October 2. The rate of the foreign exchange tax was raised from 2 percent to 5 percent.

Not for Redistribution GUATEMALA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Guatemala is the Guatemalan Quetzal. Guatemala maintains a three-tier exchange rate system: in the ''official" market, the exchange rate is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at the rate of Q 1 = US$1; in the "regulated" market, the rate is, in principle, adjusted from time to time by the Monetary Board, taking into consideration, inter alia, developments in the net international reserves of the Bank of Guatemala and movements of the exchange rate in the third market. On December 31, 1987 the exchange rate in the regulated market was Q 2.50 = US$1. In the th ird, or "banking" market, the rate is determined by demand and supply conditions in the market, subject to a max imum band of Q 3 set by the Monetary Board. On December 31, 1987 the buy ing and selling rates in the banking market were Q 2.49 and Q 2.51 per US$1, respectively. The official market exchange rate applies only to the service of external public debt and registered private debt disbursed prior to June 6, 1986. The regulated market handles transactions on trade, capital, and government services. Through the regulated market are channe led, on the receipts side, all exports to countries outside Central America, about 60 percent of exports to Central America, official capital inf lows, and inflows from regis- tered private borrowing; and, on the payments side, all imports and service paymen ts on public and registered private debt disbursed after June 6, 1986. All remaining transactions not included in the other two markets, private transfers, and private capital that is not registered with the Bank of Guatemala and tourism are channeled through the banking market. The profits or losses arising from the banking market operations are on the account of the banks of the Guatemalan Banking System. Buying and selling rates for certain currencies other than the U.S. dollar1 are also officially quoted, mainly on the basis of their rates in the New York market. A tax is levied on all exports except petroleum, with different rates for different categories of exports, which vary in proportion to their international prices. The export tax is collected, in practice, at the time of exchange surrender. On January 27, 1947 Guatemala formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control The Foreign Exchange Department of the Bank of Guatemala is in charge of administering the foreign exchange regime. Foreign exchange transactions of the public sector are carried out exclusively through the Bank 'Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Mexican pesos, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 232 of Guatemala; those of the private sector are made through banks authorized by the Monetary Board. Authorization to buy foreign currencies in the official and regulated markets must be granted by the Foreign Exchange De- partment; banks participating in the system authorize foreign paymen ts in the bank ing market. Exports of goods and services must be registered in the Foreign Exchange Department to guarantee the repatriation of the corre- sponding foreign exchange proceeds. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency In practice, most transactions in foreign exchange are denominated in U.S. dollars. Trade transactions with other Central American countries are settled in U.S. dollars. Imports and Import Payments All imports are effected at the regulated market ex- change rate. All merchandise imports must be registered with the Foreign Exchange Department or one of the authorized banks; the Bank of Guatemala issues foreign exchange licenses either against letters of credit and prepaymen ts or against original bills of lading and invoices w i th statistical information consistent w i th the import registration. Imports of goods from Nicaragua require registration with the Ministry of Economy. Import licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy are required for imports of maps of Guatemala, coffee beans and coffee plants, explosives, lead, pou l try, m i lk, eggs, sugar, wheat flour, basic food grains, cottonseed, tallow, and a few other goods. Imports of cacao are prohibited from all sources. Imports from Honduras are regulated by a bilateral trade agreement. Except in the case of imports w i th letters of credit or trade credits, a 50 percent guarantee deposit, to be made at the time of the request for foreign exchange, is required for prepayments for impor ts. Deposits may be made in cash, bank guarantees, or government bonds and are refundab le when the Bank of Guatemala has received from the importer a document issued by customs verifying the arrival of the merchand ise. In the case of imports made through particular letters of credit in the private banks, a m in imum guarantee deposit of 60 percent is required, but imports made through credit lines are exempted. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Interest paymen ts on ex ternal public and registered private debt disbursed prior to June 6, 1986 are effected at the official market exchange rate of Q 1 = US$1, wh i le interest paymen ts on such debt disbursed starting after June 6, 1986 are effected at the regulated market exchange rate. All other current invisibles transactions can be effected w i thout limit through the bank ing market. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports are subject to licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy. Exports of a few other items are prohibited, including the export of gold (unless the Bank of Guatemala issues a special export license) and silver in any form. Travelers may, however, take out up to Q 25 in silver coin that is legal tender in foreign countries. Exporters must obtain an export permit issued by the Foreign Exchange Department before the Guatemalan customs can authorize shipment of the merchandise; the granting of export permits is contingent on agreement to sell export proceeds to the Bank of Guatemala or an authorized bank w i th in one-and-a-half to three months of the date of issuance. All exchange proceeds from exports outside of Central America are converted at the regulated market exchange rate. In the case of exports destined to Central America, there are clearing arrangements among the central banks to settle payments in their own national currencies. Capital Principal paymen ts on external public debt and regis- tered private debt disbursed prior to June 6, 1986 are effected at the official market rate of Q 1 = US$1. All public sector and registered private capital inflows and principal payments on external debt and registered private debt disbursed starting from June 6, 1986 are conducted GUATEMALA through the regulated market. All other capital transac- tions take place at the rate in the banking market without limitations. All inves tment by foreign or foreign-controlled companies in the construction of private housing in Guatemala requires the prior approval of the Ministry of Economy. Investment in the petroleum sector is governed by special legislation. Gold The Bank of Guatemala can negotiate gold in coins or bars either directly or through the banks, and is entitled to require the surrender, directly or through authorized banks, of the gold holdings of any resident. The Bank sells gold to domestic artistic or industrial users, in accordance with directives of the Monetary Board. The export of gold is prohibited except when the Bank of Guatemala issues a special export license. Gold is im- ported only by the Bank of Guatemala. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments April 14. All import transactions conducted in the banking market were shifted to the regulated market. October 8. A 4 percent tax was introduced on all imports, except petroleum, Pharmaceuticals, and goods originating in the countries participating in the General Treaty for Economic Integration of Central America. 233 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUINEA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Guinea is the Guinean Franc. Guinea maintains a floating exchange rate system, with the rate vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar set in weekly auctions. At the auction, the private sector and public enterprises, through the intermediation of commercial banks, may sell and purchase foreign exchange for all import and invisible payments, except for limitations placed on purchases for tourist travel and the transfer abroad of salaries by nonresident workers. All other public sector transactions take place at the latest auction rate. The exchange rate of the Guinean franc is quoted in terms of the U.S. dollar; the rates for other currencies are determined on the basis of their U.S. dollar rates in international markets. The exchange rate for the CFA franc results from the rela- tionship between this currency and the French franc. Settlements under the bilateral payments agreement with the People's Republic of China are effected in renminbi at the rate resulting from the current GF/U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar/yuan rates. On December 31, 1987 the official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar was GF 440 per US$1. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Central Bank, which is under the direct supervision of the Pres- idency. The Bank has not delegated any of its exchange control powers. All settlements with foreign countries, including payments for imports, require approval by the Exchange Department of the Central Bank. Arrears are maintained with respect to external paymen ts. Prescription of Currency Settlements on account of transactions covered by bilateral paymen ts agreements are made in currencies prescribed by, and through accounts established under, the provisions of the agreements.1 Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (for Ben in, Burk ina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauri- tania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Settlements with other countries are made in designated "convertible" currencies quoted by the Central Bank. Resident Foreign Currency Accounts Guinean residents may open deposit accounts in foreign currency with local commercial banks. Receipts by private individuals of 50 percent of the value of gold sold to the Central Bank in foreign exchange and in cash constitutes one of the sources of foreign currency funds for these accounts. Use of funds from these accounts is limited to import financing and paymen ts for specified services. 1 Guinea maintains bilateral paymen ts agreements w i th the People's Republic of China, Cuba, and Viet Nam; all agreements except that w i th the People's Republic of China are inoperative. 234 Nonresident Accounts There are two types of nonresident accounts: Nonres- ident Transferable Accounts in Foreign Currencies, and Nonresident Accounts in Guinean Francs. The opening of a nonresident account is subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank. Imports and Import Payments Almost all products may be freely imported (except certain alcoholic beverages, armaments, and narcotics) without a license. Petroleum products may be imported only by the public sector. Mining companies may, how- ever, import crude oil directly. All imports are subject to an authorization, which is granted w i th in one week after application by the Central Bank. There are two types of authorizations: those issued for imports with access to the auction market for pur- chases of foreign exchange, and those given for imports financed with own foreign exchange (authorisation sans achat de devises). To obtain an authorization, importers are required to fill out a form (descriptif d'importation), on which information on products to be imported, their prices, and the terms of financing must be provided. In the case of authorizations with access to the auction market, they are issued only after the verification of the prices and quality of products and the terms of financing (in the case of import credits). Requests for foreign exchange must be submitted through commercial banks to the weekly auction. Certain imports are effected outside the auction system. This category comprises goods for which foreign exchange is derived from sources other than the official foreign exchange resources of Guinea and covers mainly imports by three "mixed-economy companies" (the Friguia Com- pany; the Guinea Bauxite Company; and AREDOR, the diamond company) and foreign embassies. All commodities are subject to import tariffs. Rice is subject to a zero tariff; a 5 percent tariff is levied on certain primary foodstuffs, including edible oils, wheat flour, sugar, meat, and fowl; all other imports are subject to a 10 percent tariff. In addition, a surtax of 20 percent or 30 percent is imposed on all luxury goods. The import tariff payable by two mixed enterprises in the mining sector is subject to special agreements. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles through the official foreign exchange market require the authorization of the Central Bank. Payments for freight and insurance in connection with imports are authorized as part of the import opera- tion. No official exchange is granted for other types of insurance with companies abroad. Allocations for tour- ism, other than for the purchase of airline tickets, are limited to US$500 per person per trip; each application is considered individually. Government officials on official missions are permitted an allowance of US$60 a day. In ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution cases of serious illness, when a doctor's certificate is submitted, residents may be granted foreign exchange for medical care abroad or they may be permitted to transfer exchange for the care of relatives receiving medical treatment abroad. Individual authorization is required for the payment in Guinea of all fares for foreign travel. Payments for family support through the official market may be made up to monthly amounts determined on the merits of the case; for officially recognized study abroad, the allocation is the equivalent of the amount of a government scholarship —that is, US$100 a month —but students beginning their studies abroad are granted an additional foreign exchange allowance of up to US$150. The Investment Law of 1985 (as amended in 1987) guar- antees that profits earned from approved foreign invest- ments may be transferred abroad; the transfer of certified dividends and royalties is permitted in full. It also provides for certain fiscal incentives. The transfer abroad of salaries by expatriate workers is authorized up to a limit of 40 percent of base earnings, and only for those contracts ap- proved by the Ministry of Labor. The export of Guinean currency is limited to GF 5,000 a traveler a trip. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require domiciliation with a commercial bank and filing of export description in order to (1) permit the Treasury to levy certain duties (e.g., special taxes payable in foreign exchange are levied on the volume of bauxite and alumina exported); (2) prevent shortages of goods needed for domestic consumption; and (3) prevent the export of capital. For the following commodities, special authorization from designated agencies is required: wild animals (dead or alive), edible animals, articles of historic or ethnographic interest, jewelry, articles made of precious metals, and plants and seeds. Foreign planters may be granted special transfer priv- ileges related to the quan t i ty of pineapples, bananas, or citrus fru i ts exported, and private traders may also be permitted to retain a part of their export proceeds in order to finance authorized imports. The mixed-economy companies are allowed to retain their export proceeds abroad, to pay for their imports and operating require- ments, and to service their external debt. Proceeds from Invisibles In principle, exchange proceeds accruing to residents in respect of invisibles are required to be surrendered. The import of foreign bank notes and traveler's checks is permitted free ly, subject to declaration on entry; however, both must be surrendered by residents within 15 days after entry to commercial banks, with an option for deposit in resident foreign currency accounts. Non- resident travelers may re-export the foreign exchange declared upon en try. The import of Guinean currency is limited to GF 5,000 a traveler a trip. Capital All capital transfers through the official market require authorization. Outward capital transfers by Guinean na- tionals through the official market are prohibited. GUINEA The Investment Law of 1985 provides guarantees against the nationalization of foreign investments in the industrial and mining sectors. It also provides for preferential tax and customs treatment applicable to foreign investments and for the transfer of profits, interest, amortization, and liquidation proceeds of such investments. Small- and medium-sized enterprises in which at least GF 50 million is invested over a three-year period may receive import tax reductions and exemptions from other taxes for a period of eight to ten years. Exemptions for up to 15 years may be granted on long-term investments of par- ticular importance to the economy. The minimum foreign investment in Guinean enterprises is GF 10 million. Guinean nationals must have controlling interests in enterprises requiring foreign investment of GF 10 million to GF 50 million. Gold Guinea has four issues of commemorative gold coins, which are legal tender. Furthermore, residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Guinea for numismatic purposes. With these exceptions, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than artisanal gold or jewelry, at home or abroad. Changes During 1987 Resident Foreign Currency Accounts January 21. Authorization was extended to commercial banks to purchase gold for the account of the Central Bank while maintaining the anonymity of the operators. Also, private individuals may be paid up to 50 percent of the value of the gold sold to the Central Bank in foreign exchange and in cash. Imports and Import Payments January 1. All import and invisible payments were made eligible to purchase foreign exchange at the auctions, ex- cept for limitations placed on purchases for tourist travel and the transfer abroad of salaries by expatriate workers. January 21. Advance deposit requirements were intro- duced for certain imports. Also, a requirement for the phased settlement of imports for which foreign exchange is obtained in the auction market was introduced. May 8. Advance deposit requirements for certain im- ports were abolished. Payments for Invisibles January 1. The foreign exchange allowance for tourist travel was fixed at US$500 a person a trip, with a maximum of four trips a year. The transfer abroad of salaries by expatriate workers was limited to 40 percent of base earnings, and was allowed only for those expatriates whose contracts have been approved by the Ministry of Labor. January I. Transfers of certified dividends and royalties were permitted in full. 235 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUINEA-BISSAU (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Guinea-Bissau is the Guinea-Bissau Peso. Guinea-Bissau follows a flexible exchange rate policy under which the exchange rate of the Guinea- Bissau peso in terms of the SDR is adjusted at relatively short intervals on the basis of estimated domestic price developments. Daily buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, and for other foreign currencies are fixed within margins of 2.25 percent of the SDR rate for the Guinea-Bissau peso. On December 31, 1987 the official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar was PG 767.84 per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk. Administration of Control Foreign exchange transactions are under the control of the National Bank of Guinea-Bissau (the central bank). Foreign exchange proceeds must be surrendered to the central bank. However, exporters are alllowed to retain 50 percent of proceeds to pay for eligible merchandise imports. Residents must declare to the central bank all their physical assets and foreign exchange holdings abroad. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Settlements with all foreign countries must be made in foreign currency. The central bank may prescribe the currency in which export earnings are to be received. Guinea-Bissau maintains a bilateral payments agreement with Algeria, but this agreement has been inoperative since 1981. Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Imports and Import Payments All imports are subject to prior licensing. Import licen- ses are automatically issued for a list of goods (excluding petroleum) covering about 50 percent of commercial imports. In principle, licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism in line with avail- ability of foreign exchange and on the basis of a program agreed between the central bank and the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism. Licenses are valid for the period of the import transaction. Licenses granted have to be presented to the central bank within 15 days. Only importers registered with the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism may receive licenses. Each license specifies the quantity and value (c.i.f. and f.o.b.) of the product to be imported, and a separate license is required for each 236 product. Licenses for project-related imports financed by foreign loans or grants are granted automatically. Import licenses are normally provided within 8 to 15 days of a documented request. Imports of cereals and petroleum products are state monopolies. Private sector importers with valid import licenses may freely provide their foreign exchange to finance their imports. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require the prior approval of the Committee of Foreign Exchange Control. Foreign exchange allocations for many payments for invisibles, including those for tourism and for the purchase of stocks, bonds, real estate, and profit remittances, have been temporarily suspended. Transfers of pension payments are authorized in accordance with specific criteria. Al- though no foreign exchange may be purchased for tourism, airplane tickets can be bought using domestic currency. Airline companies may transfer in foreign exchange the difference between their payments and receipts in Guinea- Bissau pesos. These transfers are approved on an ad hoc basis. Foreign exchange allowances for business travel are limited to the equivalent of PG 50,000 a trip. For study abroad, foreign exchange is granted up to the equivalent of PG 17,100 each month (PG 13,800 for high school students). Allowances for travel for health reasons are permitted up to the equivalent of PG 80,000. Remittances to close relatives (parents and children) living abroad are permitted. Foreign travelers may take out any remaining foreign currency declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require an export license. Only exporters registered with the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism may obtain export licenses, which are granted automat- ically in most cases. Until August 1986, exports of groundnuts and cashew nu ts were reserved for the Gov- ernment and were effected by two state companies, the People's Stores and SOCOMIM. Other products exported solely by the Government included palm kernels, sawn wood and logs, shrimp, fish, beer, nonalcoholic beverages, groundnut oil, and parquet flooring. On August 13, 1986 the Government authorized the private sector to engage in exportation of any product. Exporters are allowed to retain up to 50 percent of proceeds to pay for eligible merchandise imports. Since May 4, 1987 foreign exchange earnings may be surren- dered to the banking system without their sources being identified. Private exporters of nontraditional products are authorized to use up to the equivalent of their total foreign exchange receipts, less an export duty, to pay for merchandise imports. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution All exports are subject to a general fee of 1 percent. On May 4, 1987 the effective export tax rate on cashew nuts was reduced from 80 percent to 50 percent, ad valorem, and all other export taxes were abolished. A special regime applies to exports destined for countries of the Economic Commun i ty of West African States (ECOWAS). Proceeds from Invisibles Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign currency. Foreign airline companies must cover the excess of their expenditures over revenues in Guinea-Bissau pesos by transfers from abroad or by the sale of their foreign exchange receipts for Guinea-Bissau pesos. All proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered to the central bank. Capital Foreign investment operations are guided by the In- vestment Code introduced in 1980. Under this Code, which is being reviewed, exchange control is exercised over capital receipts and payments. Capital transfers associated with emigration are authorized by the 4' t ran- sitory norms" within a monthly limit of PG 50,000 and up to 20 percent of total taxable income earned during a GUINEA-BISSAU period of not more than ten years. At present, however, such transfers are suspended. Gold Exports and imports of gold are prohibited, except when authorized by the Head of State and the Ministry of Finance. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement May 4. The Guinea-Bissau peso was devalued by 60 percent from PG 263 per US$1 to PG 650 per US$1. Imports and Import Payments May 4. Import licenses were automatically issued for a list of goods, excluding petroleum, covering about 50 percent of commercial imports. Private sector importers in possession of valid import licenses were permitted to provide freely the foreign exchange to finance their imports. Exports and Export Proceeds May 4. The effective export tax rate on cashew nuts was reduced from 80 percent to 50 percent, and all other export taxes were abolished. 237 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUYANA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Guyana is the Guyana Dollar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies consisting of the pound sterling, the deutsche mark, the Japanese yen, the French franc, and the Netherlands guilder. The external value of the Guyana dollar in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is announced on a weekly basis. On January 19, 1987 the central rate for the Guyana dollar was changed from G$4.40 = US$1 to G$ 10.00 = US$1. This rate is applicable to all foreign exchange transactions, with the exception of the purchase of gold and diamonds and certain transactions conducted at the commercial banks. On February 9, 1987 a free foreign exchange market scheme intended to operate at market-related rates at the commercial banks was established.1 The initial exchange rate at this market moved to G$21.0 per US$1 by the end of June 1987, and remained at this level until the end of 1987. Effective September 21, 1987, special rates for gold and diamonds were merged with the rate in the free foreign exchange market. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies2 are also officially quoted, with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. The Bank of Guyana (the central bank) charges commissions at different rates on the purchase and sale of the officially quoted curren- cies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Guyana formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from December 27, 1966. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Minister of Finance who has entrusted its administration to the Bank of Guyana. Authority for approving current payments up to specified amounts is delegated to the banks authorized for this purpose; all other import payments and certain payments in respect of current invisibles of a personal nature require the approval of the Bank of Guyana. The Ministry of Trade and Consumer Protection is responsible for issuing import and export licenses, but import licenses involving use of official foreign exchange require the endorsement of the Bank of Guyana. Arrears are main- tained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Exchange control applies to all countries, and all currencies other than the Guyana dollar are considered 1 Several restrictions apply to transactions in the free foreign exchange market, which affect their volume and exchange rate. Exporters are not authorized to transact in this market and the main sources of foreign exchange are receipts from tourism and remittances. 2 Barbados dollars, Canadian dollars, Eastern Caribbean dollars, Ja- maica dollars, pounds sterling, and Trinidad and Tobago dollars. 238 foreign currencies. Authorized payments, including pay- ments for imports, by residents of Guyana to residents of countries outside Guyana may be made in any foreign currency or in Guyana dollars to the credit of an External Account in Guyana. Receipts from countries outside Guyana may be obtained in any foreign currency (in any listed specified currency3 for export proceeds) or in Guyana dollars from an External Account. Nonresident Accounts There are two categories of accounts for persons who are not residents of Guyana: External Accounts and Blocked Accounts. External Accounts may be opened, with exchange control approval, for persons resident outside Guyana. They may be credited freely with all authorized payments by residents of Guyana to nonresidents and with transfers from other External Accounts; other credits require approval. They may be debited freely for payments for any purpose to residents of any country, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for withdrawals by the account holder while he is in Guyana; other debits require approval. Blocked Accounts may, in principle, be credited with funds that are not placed at the free disposal of nonresi- dents (e.g., certain capital proceeds); these accounts may be debited for certain authorized payments, including the purchase of approved securities. Since mid-1978 Blocked Accounts have been used to hold domestic currency deposits equivalent in value to pending applications for foreign exchange. Such deposits carry a market-related interest rate. The Bank of Guyana provides full exchange rate guarantee for deposits made before the devaluation of January 1984, partial exchange rate guarantee (at the rate of G$5.00 = US$1) for deposits made between January 1984 (after devaluation) and end-January 1987, and no exchange rate guarantee for the deposits made after end-1987. Imports and Import Payments All imports from or transiting South Africa are prohib- ited. Imports of certain other commodities are also pro- hibited from all sources. Permissible imports are subject to individual licensing, but the following commodities are exempted: passengers' baggage, household effects and personal effects, bona fide patterns and samples that have a stipulated f.o.b. value, parcel post items of a certain value imported by individuals, and gifts subject to certain conditions. In addition, from May 1, 1982 a scheme was to be introduced under which a manufacturer would be permitted to import spare parts up to c.i.f. value of 3 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution G$5,000 and any items of equipment or machinery up to c.i.f. value of G$ 10,000 without having to apply for an import license, provided that no foreign exchange from Guyana would be required to pay for the imports. So far, however, the scheme has not become operational. An import license is granted on a priority basis, as follows: (1) raw materials for the manufacture of essential items; (2) essential items; (3) raw materials for manufac- turers serving the export markets and the essential ser- vices in industry; (4) equipment and materials for sawmills in the timber indus try; (5) commodities for hatcheries; (6) spare parts; (7) petroleum products; (8) importation by international organizations and diplomatic personnel; and (9) drugs. However, an application for an import license will not normally be approved for commodities when similar ones are produced locally and at reasonable levels to supply domestic needs or sustain exportation. Public sector corporations have a monopoly over the importation of specified commodities from all sources. Import licenses are issued in respect of certain specified commodities only to the government corporation that has been identified to procure them centrally. When the responsibility of handling imports of any commodity has been given to a single government agency with a view to eliminating duplication of ordering between such agencies, the relevant licenses are issued only to that corporation. A similar course of action is adopted when standardization of commodities is involved. As a general rule, licenses are issued only to government corporations for the pro- curement of supplies for the retail and distributive sectors of the economy on a national, rather than a local, basis. Licenses are not normally made available to private sector concerns or individuals for goods to be disposed of by retail trade, other than to dealers in spare parts. Import licenses continue to be approved for specialized require- ments of government and private concerns connected with sugar, bauxite, rice, timber, and manufacturing industries, as the case may be. There are no import quotas, but the granting of import licenses is subject in large measure to the availability of foreign exchange. In general, applications for licenses not involving use of official foreign exchange (i.e., " no-foreign exchange" licenses) are granted on a relatively liberal basis; most imports of consumer goods take place on this basis. Applications for no-funds licenses for imports of production inputs by local companies able to arrange their own financing abroad are granted freely. All appli- cations for foreign exchange must be accompanied by a domestic currency deposit of equivalent value, to be held in Blocked Accounts with commercial banks. Commercial banks are required to maintain a 100 percent reserve requirement against these deposits at the Bank of Guyana. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries require ap- proval. The basic annual exchange allocation for tourist travel is G$500 a person and is not cumulative. The allocation for education depends on each circumstance and is granted in terms of foreign currency needs. Resident GUYANA and nonresident travelers are subject on departure to an exit tax of G$50 a person. Persons traveling abroad may take with them Guyana currency notes not exceeding G$40; these notes do not form part of any allotment of exchange for travel. The equivalent of up to G$250 may be taken out in actual currency notes as part of the foreign exchange allowance for foreign travel. Nonresident travelers may, within one month of their last entry, freely take out any foreign currency notes declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Sugar may be exported only by the Guyana Sugar Corporation, and bauxite and alumina, only by the Guyana Mining Enter- prise Limited. Certain other exports are also channeled through official agencies. Most exports do not require export licenses, but transactions are supervised by the Bank of Guyana and the Customs and Excise Department to ensure that the exchange proceeds are repatriated and, if obtained in listed specified currencies (see footnote 3), surrendered. Exchange control forms have to be com- pleted for all exports exceeding G$200 in value. A foreign exchange retention scheme permits exporters to retain a certain percentage of export proceeds. The retention ratio is 100 percent for bauxite, 15 percent for sugar, 20 percent for fishing and shrimping sectors and gold mining, and up to 50 percent for manufactured exports by the private sector. Retained foreign exchange may be used relatively liberally for imports of inputs and external debt servicing by exporters. Proceeds from Invisibles Specified currencies (see footnote 3) received on ac- count of invisibles must be sold to an authorized bank, but other currencies may be retained by the recipient. Travelers may bring in freely any amount in foreign bank notes; domestic bank notes up to a value of G$40 may be brought in by returning travelers only. Capital Private investment, both foreign and domestic, is gov- erned by the Private Investment Code of 1979. Foreign investors must apply to the Bank of Guyana for approved status for new investments at the time of investment in order to be able to repatriate capital. Such approval is normally given for direct investments in new projects that would benefit the balance of payments or the economy of Guyana; "approved status" assures that profits may be remitted, and that upon liquidation of the investment, the proceeds, including any capital increments after pay- ment of all taxes, may be repatriated in full in the currency of the original investment. Foreign-based companies and their subsidiaries can borrow in Guyana only with the express approval of the Bank of Guyana. The export of capital by residents is not normally permitted. Listed specified currencies (see footnote 3) obtained by residents through capital transactions must be surrendered to an authorized bank, but other currencies 239 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUYANA may be retained by the recipient. Emigrants of Guyanese nationality may not transfer abroad any part of their capital assets other than a settling-in allowance of G$250 for each member of a family unit; emigrants of foreign nationality may export all declared capital assets, an amount of G$24,000 a family unit at the time of emigration, and G$17,300 in each successive calendar year. Borrowing from nonresidents requires exchange control approval. However, publicly owned enterprises are en- couraged to borrow abroad for the financing of specific projects and in some instances for working capital pur- poses. Since mid-1979 any borrowing by a public sector corporation is subject to prior approval by the Govern- ment Debt Committee. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Guyana for numismatic purposes, and also jewelry. With these exceptions, residents other than the monetary authorities, authorized dealers, producers of gold, and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form, at home or abroad, without special permis- sion. Imports and exports of gold in any form by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, authorized dealers, producers of gold, and industrial users require licenses issued by the Ministry of Trade. Residents traveling abroad are allowed to take out with them jewelry up to a value of G$2,000, G$l,500, and G$500, for women, men, and children under 12 years of age, respectively. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 19. The central rate for the Guyana dollar was changed from G$4.40 = US$1 to G$10.00 = US$1. February 2. A free foreign exchange market scheme intended to operate at market-related rates at the com- mercial banks was established. June 1.

The exchange rates for gold and dia- monds were merged with the rate in the free foreign exchange market. 240 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution HAITI (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Haiti is the Haitian Gourde, the parity of which is defined in terms of the SDR, but in such a way as to preserve the relationship of G 5 = US$1. Both the official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar are G 5 = US$1. The U.S. dollar circulates freely and is generally accepted in Haiti. Sales of foreign exchange are subject to a local tax of 0.2 percent. Commercial banks quote buying and selling rates for certain other currencies, based on the buying and selling rates of the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. Haiti formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from December 22, 1953. Administration of Control The administration of the foreign exchange system is under the control of the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (the central bank), and exchange transactions are imple- mented by this Bank and certain commercial banks. The tax code provides for a penalty, payable to the tax authorities, equal to 20 percent of any commercial foreign exchange transaction not conducted through a bank es- tablished in Haiti. Aside from this requirement, there is no exchange control, and there are no obligations pre- scribing the method or currency for payments to or from nonresidents. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Imports and Import Payments Quantitative restrictions on 76 items, which were lifted on June 23, 1986, were replaced by ad valorem tariffs averaging 20 percent on Ju ly 20, 1986. At the same time, specific tariffs were replaced by ad valorem ones, or existing tariffs were lowered for approximately 300 of the 2,000 tariff positions. By a decree of February 10, 1987, a new tariff structure was introduced that replaced all remaining specific duties by ad valorem tariffs and estab- lished new tariff rates of between zero and 40 percent, with the exception of five products (rice, maize, millet, flour, and gasoline). Gasoline is subject to a tariff of 57.8 percent, and rice, maize, millet, and flour are subject to a rate of 50 percent. The average tariff rate was set at about 20 percent, with the tariffs on equ ipmen t, raw materials, and some inpu ts set at 10 percent or lower. Pharmaceutical imports are exempt from import duties. As a transitional measure to allow domestic producers to adapt to the new regime, the previous tariff levels on domestically manufactured goods remained in effect until December 31, 1987. The consular fee of 3 percent, which was formerly payable in the country of origin on all imports, except for materials required by certain export industries, is now payable to the customs administration in Haiti. A sales tax of 10 percent is applied on the value of imports. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of agricultural products require prior authori- zation from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Such authorization is usually granted freely but may be withheld when domestic supplies are low. In accordance with an agreement concluded with the central bank on June 19, 1984, commercial banks set aside up to 50 percent of the foreign exchange proceeds from all exports, which is used to meet oil imports and certain debt service payments. Exporters are required to negotiate documen- tary drafts with local commercial banks to ensure the repatriation of their export proceeds. Under a law pub- lished on June 4, 1984, the customs administration will refuse export approval unless such drafts are cleared by the central bank. A law on August 2, 1984 set export duties on light and natural coffee at 19 percent and 24 percent, respectively, and required coffee exporters to declare the volume of their outstanding coffee stock. Coffee export duties were eliminated in October 1987. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for invisibles are not restricted. Residents traveling abroad must pay a tax of G 250 on tickets and an airport tax of G 75. They must also buy a G 25,000 travel insurance policy by paying a premium of G 52; diplomats and staff members of international organiza- tions are exempt. Capital Capital transfers abroad are not normally permitted but imports of capital may be made freely. Foreign investment in Haiti is regulated by the decrees of March 13, 1963, October 8, 1969, and December 31, 1984, and requires prior government approval. Permission is normally not granted to nonresidents for investments in handicraft industries. Under a decree of April 6, 1973, private banks operating in Haiti are required to keep a m in imum of 85 percent of their liabilities to local customers in the form of domestic assets. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Haiti for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewe lry, at home or abroad. The Bank of the Republic of Haiti has the exclusive right to purchase gold domestically and to export gold in the form of coin, mineral dus t, or bars. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry carried as personal effects by travelers may be made only by the Bank of the Republic of Haiti; exports require in addition prior authorization 241 ©International Monetary Fund.

Several gold coins have been issued, which are legal tender but do not circulate. Changes During 1987 Import and Import Payments February 10. All remaining specific tariffs were replaced by ad valorem tariffs. With the exception of five products (rice, maize, millet, flour, and gasoline), all import tariff rates were set between zero and 40 percent.

Not for Redistribution HONDURAS (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Honduras is the Honduran Lempira, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at L 2 = US$1. The official buy ing and selling rates for the U.S. dollar are L 2.00 and L 2.02, respec- tively, per US$1. The buying and selling rates for other currencies that are of significance to the foreign trade of Honduras are fixed daily on the basis of the buying and selling rates of the currency concerned against the U.S. dollar in foreign markets. Separate exchange rates arise from an arrangement permitting exporters to Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Guatemala to transfer their foreign exchange proceeds to importers at freely negotiated exchange rates.1 There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On August 19, 1950 Honduras formally notified the Fund that it had assumed the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, beginning on July 1, 1950. Prescription of Currency There are no regulations prescribing the method of currency for payments to or from nonresidents. Trade transactions with the rest of Central America may be carried out in local currencies, barter and compensation mechanisms, or U.S. dollar proceeds from exports to the rest of the Central American countries. In additon, a bilateral clearing house arrangement operates for trans- actions with Guatemala, under which outstanding bal- ances are required to be settled every two months. The Central Bank of Honduras authorizes imports under this arrangement only when exports to Guatemala have taken place. Trade transactions with Nicaragua are carried out under a bilateral credit agreement. Payments to and receipts from Colombia in respect of merchandise trade and invisibles are settled on a six-month basis in U.S. dollars through a reciprocal credit arrangement between the member Central American central banks and the Bank of the Republic of Colombia. Payments to and receipts from Mexico in respect of merchandise trade and invisi- bles are settled on a four-monthly basis in U.S. dollars under an agreement between the Central American central banks and the Bank of Mexico. Beginning August 1983, all lempira-denominated pay- ments amounting to at least L 1,500 processed through the Central American Clearing House in respect of trade and trade-related transactions with Mexico, Colombia, and member countries of the Central American Common Market (CACM) require prior authorization from the Central Bank of Honduras. 1 At the end of December 1987 the implicit value of the lempira in this market was L 2.7 per US$1. Imports and Import Payments Import permits are required for all imports in excess of L 5,000 and are issued by the External Financing Department of the Central Bank (DERFE). Imports are categorized according to those that must be paid for in cash (mainly nonessential imports) and those that can be financed with credit. The purpose of the classification is to discourage the import of luxury goods by denying them foreign credit and limiting their access to domestic credit by setting portfolio ceilings. A priority scheme for the approval of import permits has been established on a temporary basis, with the intention of fur ther restraining the demand for nonessen- tial imports; the scheme includes five categories with specified maximum waiting periods in each case. Im- porters using their own sources of foreign exchange can obtain import permits within five days. However, there is also a list of selected items whose importation is subject to prior approval by the Ministry of Economy before an import permit can be authorized by DERFE, in order to provide protection for domestic industries. Imports may be checked for appropriate pricing, and import prepay- ments are subject to certain restrictions regarding the means of settlement. Depending on the foreign exchange situation, the For- eign Exchange Department of the Central Bank may subject the allocation of foreign exchange for imported goods and services to a set of policy-determined priori- ties.2 A guarantee deposit of up to 100 percent may be required against requests to open sight letters of credit for import payments; the deposits are held with com- mercial banks. Importers are also required to deposit with the Central Bank the lempira equivalent of requests for official foreign exchange that are not granted within a specified waiting period. A system of 'Transferable Certificates of Foreign Exchange" (CETRAS) operates for the purpose of pro- moting nontraditional exports and encouraging repatria- tion of proceeds from these exports. Under this system, the commercial banks issue CETRAS to exporters when they sell export proceeds to the banks. The value of CETRAS in relation to the export receipts surrendered is determined by the Central Bank of Honduras according to the value added of each export product. CETRAS are denominated in lempiras, and the holder will have pref- erential access to foreign exchange at the official rate. They may be used during the first four mon ths from the day of issuance to register under the system of "own- foreign exchange" imports and to request foreign ex- change at the official rate for payments for imports, 2 The Central Bank is authorized to allocate foreign exchange in accordance w i th the following priorities: external financial payments; essential consumer items; health products; educational materials; fuel and lubricants; raw materials; agricultural and industrial inpu ts; machinery, equ ipmen t, and spare parts; and other goods and services. 243 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution HONDURAS services, or other purposes approved by the Central Bank of Honduras. During the subsequent three-month period, CETRAS may be utilized to purchase foreign exchange for the transactions authorized by the Central Bank. Unu t i- lized CETRAS will lose their value after seven months of issuance. Within the first month from the day of issuance, CETRAS may be transferred once, at a negotiated price, by the original holder. Importation of corn, rice, sorghum, beans, and potatoes is the monopoly of the Honduran Institute of Agricultural Marketing (IHMA). Most imports from countries outside the CACM are subject to customs duty. Imports from the CACM are subject to customs duties ranging from zero to 35 percent. Certain goods are subject to a customs surtax of 12 percent of the duty and to a consular charge of 8 percent of the f.o.b. value. In addition, most imports are subject to an import service fee of 5 percent. There is a duty-free zone in Puerto Cortes. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Exports and Export Proceeds Any agricultural or agro-industrial export with a value exceeding US$5,000 requires a license and is subject to prior authorization of the External Financing Department of the Central Bank. All foreign exchange proceeds must be surrendered either to the Central Bank or to authorized banks and institutions, or be held as dollar-denominated deposits with commercial banks. Subject to prior author- ization by the Central Bank, exporters are allowed to retain up to 30 percent of their foreign exchange proceeds to finance their own imports. The withdrawal of dollar- denominated deposits is subject to compliance with the procedures on the use of foreign exchange. In general, the surrender of export proceeds must be made within 90 days following the negotiation of export documents. The banks are required to transfer 50 percent of their holdings of foreign exchange proceeds from exports to the Central Bank. Exports of coffee are supervised by the Honduran Coffee Institute (!HCAFE). Exports of corn, rice, beans, and potatoes are controlled by IHMA, and lumber exports are channeled through the Honduran Forest Development Corporation (COHDEFOR). There is an export tax on bananas, coffee, cattle, meat, sugar, and minerals, and a general export duty of 1 percent of the f.o.b. value of all other export items except bananas, coffee, cattle, meat, sugar, minerals, and nontraditional products. The export promotion law enables nontraditional exports to receive a credit against domestic taxes. CETRAS are made available under a system set up for the purpose of promoting nontraditional exports and encouraging repatriation of proceeds from these exports. (See section on Imports and Import Payments, above). exchange in excess of US$5,000 require prior approval of the Central Bank, and all buyers of foreign exchange are required to file an application stating the purpose for which the funds will be used. Within this limit, persons traveling abroad may purchase foreign currency notes and coins in an amount not exceeding US$100 a person. No restrictions exist on the import of foreign bank notes by travelers. There are delays in the provision of foreign exchange for the transfers of dividends and profits. Capital The authorization of the Minister of Finance and approval by the Central Bank are required for all activities involving the receipt of foreign exchange and their transfer abroad for purposes of investment in mutual fund s, housing developments, real estate, or similar activities. Foreign mutual funds and similar financial institutions require permission to collect funds in Honduras for deposit or investment abroad. The approval of the Ministry of Finance, the Secretariat of Coordination, Planning, and Budget (SECPLAN), and the Central Bank is required for the public sector to contract any foreign indebtedness, whether for import financing or for other purposes. The contracting of external debt by the private sector requires approval by the Central Bank. External debt contracts must be registered with the Central Bank, which provides foreign exchange for the servicing of duly registered and approved external debt only. The contracting of external financing must conform w i th specified priorities. Sight and term deposits in foreign currency at the banks are subject to a reserve requirement of 30 percent; the reserve requirement for certificates of deposit of US$25,000 and above is 20 percent, and 15 percent for savings deposits in foreign currency with savings and loan associations. Commercial banks are required to transfer foreign ex- change holdings in excess of specified limits to the Central Bank. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Honduras for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized in- dustrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, industrial users, and producers of gold. All locally produced gold is exported in the form of ore for refining. Commercial imports and exports of jewelry and other articles con- taining gold require licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy; for most articles, these are granted freely. Exports of gold are subject to a tax of 5 percent. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles are either subject to a surren- der requirement or must be held as dollar-denominated deposits with commercial banks.

Not for Redistribution HONG KONG1 (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Hong Kong is the Hong Kong Dollar. The authorities do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions. Starting on October 17, 1983, certificates of indebtedness denominated in Hong Kong dollars and issued by the Government Exchange Fund, which the two note-issuing commercial banks are required to hold as backing for their Hong Kong dollar note issues, are issued only against payment of U .S. dollars at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 = US$1; paymen ts by the Exchange Fund on surrender of certificates of indebted- ness to it when the note issue declines are also made in U .S. dollars at the same exchange rate. By arrangement, other licensed banks also pay or receive U.S. dollars at this same rate when they draw bank notes from or surrender them to the note-issuing banks. With these exceptions, the exchange rate for the Hong Kong dollar is freely determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, though influenced by the fixed rate that applies to note-issue transactions. The authorities do, however, retain a capability to intervene in the marke t. On December 31, 1987 the middle rate in the in terbank foreign exchange market for the U .S. dollar, the inter- vention currency, was HKS7.76 = US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The forward exchange markets are operated on private sector initiatives and the Government has no official role. Administration of Control There is no exchange control. Import and export licensing is carried out mainly by the Director of Trade. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements are in force. Settlements between residents of Hong Kong and non- residents may be made and received freely in Hong Kong dollars or any other currency. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between resident and nonresi- dent accounts. Imports and Import Payments Imports are free from licensing control, except for certain dutiable commodities, items controlled for hea l th, safety, or security reasons, and textiles that are subject to licensing control for surveillance reasons. Imports of rice are subject to a quota sys tem operated by the Department of Trade. W i th a few exceptions, a trade declaration must be lodged w i th the Cus toms and Excise Department w i th in 14 days of importation in respect of each consignment of goods imported in to or exported from Hong Kong. Payments for perm i t ted imports may be made f ree ly, at any t ime, and in any cu r rency. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required for a small number of items to enable Hong Kong to fu l f i ll its in terna t ional obligations and for hea l th, safe ty, or security reasons. Textiles are also subject to licensing control because of a number of bilateral arrangemen ts w i th specified coun- tries under which the export of certain textiles is re- stricted. Export proceeds may be collected at any time and in any cu r rency. They need not be repatriated or surrendered. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles There are no limitations on paymen ts for or receipts from inv is ib les. Resident and nonres ident travelers may free ly bring in and take out any amount in domestic or foreign bankno te s, trave ler's checks, and other means of paymen t. Capital No exchange control requ iremen ts are imposed on capital receipts or paymen ts by residents or nonres iden ts. A license is required before any company, whe ther incorporated in Hong Kong or elsewhere, can do banking business in Hong Kong. Subject to certain conditions, an overseas bank can establish a representative office in Hong Kong and may also register a subsidiary as a deposit-taking company. A deposit-taking company may no t, however, conduct bank ing business or use the word "bank" in its title. Gold There is a free market for gold in wh ich dealings by residents and nonres iden ts are unres tr ic ted. Imports and exports of gold in any form ( inc lud ing finished jewe lry) are freely perm i t ted and do not require licenses. Residents may hold gold in any form in Hong Kong or abroad. A gold coin of HK$ 1,000 is legal tender but does not circulate.

Not for Redistribution HUNGARY (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Hungary is the Hungarian Forint. The exchange rate of the forint against currencies other than those of the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA)1 and Albania and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is derived on the basis of a weighted basket o f t en currencies;2 the weights are adjusted annually and reflect the currency composition of Hungary's foreign trade turnover (export receipts from and import payments to) the nonruble currency area. The value of the forint in terms of the basket is adjusted at irregular intervals, notably on the basis of the difference between the domestic and foreign rates of inflation. Exchange rates are quoted on a daily basis by the National Bank of Hungary for 20 convertible currencies,3 and the National Bank stands ready to effect transactions in any of these currencies. Buying and selling rates are set with a spread of V\o of 1 percent around the middle rate for each currency.4 Rates for other currencies are based on the quoted rate for the U.S. dollar and the dollar rates for the currencies concerned in international markets. Rates for currencies included in the basket to which the forint is pegged (within margins of 1 percent) are based on the day's exchange rates in major interna- tional markets. The buying and selling rates for spot transactions in U.S. dollars on December 31, 1987 were Ft 46.3405 and Ft 46.4333, respectively, per US$1. Official forward exchange rates are quoted by the National Bank of Hungary in respect of the above- mentioned 20 convertible currencies for which exchange rates are quoted on a daily basis as well as the clearing currencies (U.S. dollar and Swiss franc) used under bilateral agreements. Forward rates are determined by adjusting the official foreign exchange midpoint rates valid at a particular time for percentage differentials set by the Bank variously for periods of 7-30 days, 90 days, 180 days, 270 days, and 360 days. The Bank is prepared to buy (or sell) currencies forward from (or to) enterprises having foreign exchange receipts (or expenditures) arising from foreign trade (and/or other foreign activities, such as tourism, transportation, etc.). 1 The member countries of the CMEA are Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslo- vakia, the German Democratic Repub l ic, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam. 2 Austrian schillings, deu tsche mark, French francs, Italian l ire, Japa- nese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. Each of these currencies accounts for at least 1 percent of foreign trade turnover. 3 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dol- lars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kuwa i ti dinars, Netherlands guilders, Norwe- gian kroner, pounds sterling, Portuguese escudos, Spanish pesetas, Swed- ish kronor, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, and European Currency Un i ts (ECUs). In addition to the above, exchange rates for bank notes and traveler's checks are quoted for Greek drachmas and Yugoslav dinars. 4 The spread of 0.2 percent between buy ing and selling rates applies to spot telegraphic transactions. For checks and bank notes, a 6 percent spread is maintained between buy ing and selling rates. The largest portion of Hungary's trade and financial settlements with the member countries of the CMEA is settled in transferable rubles through the International Bank for Economic Cooperation (IBEC), and with Al- bania, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the People's Republic of Kampuchea in clearing rubles. Official ex- change rates for the transferable ruble and the clearing ruble are, in principle, quoted daily by the National Bank, although these rates remain fixed for longer periods. At the end of December 1987, the buying and selling rates for the forint against 1 transferable ruble were Ft 26.9730 and Ft 27.0270, respectively. The same rates applied to the clearing ruble.5 The National Bank also quotes rates of exchange for the forint against the currencies of member countries of the CMEA, Albania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. These rates are used for noncommercial settlements; for example, international travel, expenses of diplomatic representation, and scholarships6 are based on multilateral agreements or, in some cases, on supplemental bilateral agreements. Administration of Control The authority for enforcement of foreign exchange regulations is vested in the Minister of Finance. Related functions are exercised by the Minister through the National Bank, except for those functions reserved for the Minister himself or delegated to other institutions, such as the Hungarian Foreign Trade Bank and the Central Corporation of Banking Companies. The National Bank may entrust other agencies, such as banking institutions and travel agencies, with the performance of specified tasks. The Central European International Bank Ltd., established jointly by the National Bank and Western European and Japanese interests, City Bank Budapest, and Unibank are exempt from Hungarian foreign exchange regulations and restrictions in respect of authorized activities. Foreign trade is a state monopoly. In practice, this means that commercial exports and imports may be effected only by economic enterprises authorized for this purpose. As from January 1, 1986, the authorization of foreign trading activities in convertible currencies has been largely liberalized. In July 1987 general trading rights were extended to any enterprise with exports in con- vertible currencies of more than US$1 million in the previous year, which increased the number of enterprises with general trading rights to 101 (including the 40 spe- cialized foreign trade organizations). All foreign trading companies have been permitted to trade (export and 5 On January 1, 1988 the exchange rate of the forint against the transferable ruble was revalued to Ft 25.9740 (buying) and Ft 26.0260 (selling). 6 A commission of 3 percent applies to purchases from tourists of bank notes in the currencies of member countries of the CMEA. 247 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution HUNGARY import) any product, except certain goods on the negative list. Certain items were removed from the negative list on July 1, 1987. The foreign trading right is granted within 45 days to all producer enterprises for the export of their own products and for the import of the inputs necessary for their own production under simplified procedures. Organizations that do not intend to conduct foreign trade channel their imports and exports through authorized organizations. At the end of December 1987, 350 enter- prises were authorized to engage in foreign trade on a permanent basis, of which 40 were specialized foreign trade organizations;7 the rest consisted of industrial en- terprises, state farms, cooperatives, and domestic trading concerns. In addition, approvals for ad hoc foreign trade activities were granted in more than 1,000 cases during 1987. Authorization to enter into foreign trade may thus be either general or specific. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries with which Hungary has multilateral and bilateral payments agreements are made in the currencies and in accordance with the procedures set forth in those agreements.8 If there are no specific agreements, or if trade takes place outside the scope of the agreements, settlement is made in a con- vertible currency. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident juridical and physical persons may main- tain convertible currency accounts at the National Bank, certain designated offices of the National Savings Bank, the Foreign Trade Bank, and the General Banking and Trust Co., Ltd.; only relatively large amounts may be placed with the National Bank. The accounts carry tax- free interest, payable in the currency of deposit, and have a guarantee of repayment but no exchange rate guarantee. Nonresident deposits at the National Bank earn rates of interest set on a competitive basis with those in interna- tional markets. Interest rates on nonresident deposits at the National Savings Bank at the end of December 1987 ranged from 3 percent to 123/4 percent a year, depending on the currency and the maturity of the deposit and reflecting the financial market situation. No authorization is required to open such accounts or to draw on them. Unless specifically exempted, payments in forint to nonresidents must be deposited in blocked forint accounts 7 In addition, there were nine enterprises specializing in the represen- tation of foreign enterprises. 8 At the end of December 1987, Hungary had bilateral paymen ts agreements with Albania, the People's Republic of China, Colombia, Ecuador, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the People's Republic of Kampuchea. Hungary also had trade agreements with bilateral payments features for certain commodities with Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. Except for Albania, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the People's Republic of Kampuchea, settlements under bilateral agreements were in clearing U.S. dollars. Settlements with the People's Republic of China were in clearing Swiss francs; and with Albania, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the People's Republic of Kampuchea, in clearing rubles. 248 at the General Banking and Trust Company. Approval authority for withdrawals from blocked forint accounts has been delegated to the National Savings Bank for specified uses —for example, living expenses while trav- eling in Hungary, medical expenses, and certain personal and family-related expenses; approval may be obtained on the basis of a verbal declaration. Requests for approval for other uses must be referred to the National Bank. All requests for reasonable purposes are granted. In general, no interest is paid on these accounts. Residents may also open accounts at designated offices of the National Savings Bank either in foreign currencies or in forint convertible into foreign currencies. Foreign exchange earned from creative, inven t ive, or artistic activity (including the royalties of authors, composers, and performing artists), honoraria, prizes, and awards, and specified fees may be deposited in these accounts. Effective October 1, 1987, up to 50 percent income or assets in convertible currencies from these sources may be deposited in these accounts. No limits apply to income from these sources earned in the currencies of countries accounting in rubles. In addition, reasonable amounts of savings from per diem payments, wages and salaries derived from employment abroad, scholarships, and ar- tistic performances may be deposited in these accounts. Separate accounts are kept for deposits made in con- vertible and CMEA currencies. No authorization is required for the use of accounts of residents in foreign currencies or in forint convertible into foreign currencies. Withdrawals of convertible cur- rency balances can be made in any convertible or CMEA currency, in Yugoslav dinars, or in forint. CMEA balances can only be withdrawn in a CMEA currency or in forint. The deposits may be used for foreign travel or to purchase foreign goods through the Konsumex and the Intertourist shops, or directly from abroad against payment in con- vertible currencies. Deposits of more than one-year ma- turity earn interest at rates prevailing on international markets. Residents can also hold another category of accounts, called BC foreign currency accounts. Deposits in these accounts are limited to transfers from nonresidents to residents for the purpose of financing residents' expenses while traveling abroad. Such deposits can be used in lieu of a nonresident's affidavit in applying for a visitor's travel visa (see section on Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles, below). Imports and Exports All imports and exports are subject to a licensing requirement. Licenses are issued by the Licensing De- partment of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. No further license from the foreign exchange authority is required for export or import and the performance or use of related services. Import licenses may be global or individual and, unless otherwise specified, are valid until the end of the calendar year for which they are issued. Global licenses allow the transaction to take place with any country for the goods ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution and services specified in the license; such licenses are used primarily for bulk imports of items, such as fertilizer and steel products, which are spread over the course of the year. Individual licenses permit transactions to take place only as specified. A fee equivalent to 1 percent of the forint value of licensed imports settled in convertible currency is levied. Imports are subject to import duties, a 4 percent customs fee upon customs clearance, and a 5 percent statistical fee.9 An advance import deposit scheme for capital goods introduced in 1968 remains in place but has not been activated since 1971. Separately, a forint cover require- ment applies to both imports and inves tment financing and is to be deposited at the respective commercial bank in advance. Every five days commercial banks place the forint deposit with the National Bank, which effects payments for imports. In the case of imports, the importer is required to deposit the forint equivalent of the value of the letter of credit in a blocked non-interest-bearing account at the respective commercial bank when opening a letter of credit. When importing on behalf of other end- users, foreign trade organizations can obtain payment from the end-user up to a maximum of 15 days before the due date for payment by the latter. The due date for payment can relate either to the date when a letter of credit is to be opened or, for imports against documents of acceptance, to the date of payment. In the case of investment financing, a letter from the respective com- mercial bank confirming that financing for the project has been secured in fu ll is required before spending can be initiated. The related financing is frozen in a non-interest- bearing account at the time the letter is issued by the respective commercial bank. In the case of imported capital goods, the letter must be submitted to the licensing authority before the import license is issued. Apart from the import of consumer goods settled in convertible currencies, the licensing of imports was quasi- automatic and was used essentially for the purpose of ensuring that only authorized enterprises engaged in international trade. Beginning in September 1982, imports of several, mainly primary, products were made subject to quotas. In addition, the regime for imports settled in the convertible currencies was applied more restrictively: imports of capital goods, other imports by large and frequent importers in excess of specified quarterly limits, and all imports by other importers were subject to individual approval on the basis of the availability of foreign exchange. These restrictions were gradually lifted during the course of 1983 and 1984; by the end of 1984, the quasi-automatic licensing system in effect before September 1982 had been fu l ly restored. Imports of consumer goods settled in convertible currencies are subject to a global quota, the dollar value of which is published annually in the Foreign Trade Gazette. The value of the quota for 1987 was set at US$170 million, but was increased to US$192 million in November 1987.10 9 W i th effect from Apr il 1, 1988, the cus toms fee was reduced to 2 percent and the statistical fee was reduced to 3 percent. 10 The quota for 1988 has been set at US$170 m i l l ion. HUNGARY Licenses against the quota are granted on an order-of- arrival basis, and unused allocations are not automatically added to the quota for the next year. Settlement in foreign exchange is authorized and ef- fected upon receipt, and according to the terms, of valid documents for settlement. Ex post verification of com- pliance with the terms of the license is made by the foreign exchange authority twice a year. Certain imports are prohibited for sanitary, security, and other noneco- nomic reasons. Hungary has been a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) since 1973. As part of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTN), the arithmetic average tariff level applied on a most-favored-nation basis was reduced from 24.9 percent in 1979 to 16.1 percent as from January 1, 1987. Imports from the least-developed countries are duty free. In general, re turn ing Hungarian travelers may import, free of customs d u t y, goods for noncommercial use up to a value of Ft 10,000. Re turn ing residents may import, free of customs du ty, goods up to a value equivalent to 40 percent of their earnings while stationed abroad for more than one year. Border trade is conducted on the basis of intergovernmental agreements. Certain exports are prohibited for sanitary, security, and other noneco- nomic reasons. Indirect taxes on exports settled in con- vertible currencies are refunded at a rate equivalent to 6 percent of value.11 In addition, an export subsidy may be applied to exports of agricultural products and pro- cessed foods settled in convertible currencies, amoun t ing to not more than 28 percent of the value of the agricultural raw material content of these exports. The tax refund and the subsidy are calculated on the basis of the customs invoice value. Most trade with member countries of the CMEA, Albania, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Lao People's Republic, and the People's Republic of Kampuchea is conducted under bilateral agreements. Trade within this framework takes place at prices fixed in the annual bilateral agreements on the basis of quotas representing delivery obligations, with determined con- ditions of delivery. Subsidies may be paid to compensate exporting enterprises for losses incurred if such exports are required for fu lf i l lment of the obligations of the agreement. All foreign assets and currencies must be declared and all foreign exchange assets must be sold to the National Bank of Hungary, unless otherwise exempted. Declara- tion must be made within eight days, but the length of time allowed for repatriation depends on the nature of the case. The Foreign Trade Bank is generally exempt from the obligation to surrender its foreign exchange assets to the National Bank. The National Savings Bank and the General Banking and Trust Company are exempt from the surrender requirement in certain cases; specific exemptions for individuals are granted in respect of gifts 11 Effec t ive January 1, 1988, the 6 percent tax refund on exports settled in convertible currencies has been terminated. 249 ©International Monetary Fund.

Receipts of foreign currency not exceeding Ft 2,000 (in bank notes only) a person are also generally exempt from the surrender requirement. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for invisibles related to merchandise trans- actions, including transportation and advertising, are freely granted. Generally, other invisible transactions exceeding Ft 5,000 require general or individual autho- rization by either the Ministry of Finance or other com- petent authority. Foreign exchange for related payments is made available automatically once the transaction has been authorized. Budgetary or social institutions may obtain general authorizations for transactions up to specified amounts in connection with their own activities. General authori- zation up to specified amounts or proportions of turnover is given to enterprises engaging in foreign economic activities for the purpose of defraying expenses other than those directly related to trade. Such authorizations relate to expenses for travel and other expenses, such as the maintenance of foreign representation and related personnel expenses. Compliance with the conditions of the general authorizations is reviewed on an ex post basis by the Ministry of Finance, the chief control administra- tion of the Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank. Permission for travel to countries outside the CMEA area is granted only upon evidence of means of support abroad. This requirement can be met in one of three ways: (1) if living expenses while abroad are covered by nonresidents (in which case an affidavit from the nonres- ident or the availability of sufficient funds in a resident BC account at Touring, Money Changing, Traveling and Shipping Co., Inc. (!BUSZ) is required); (2) if living expenses while abroad are covered from the resident's own funds in a convertible currency account or from a travel allowance obtained from the National Bank; or (3) if travel is with an authorized tourist group. Travelers under the first category are labeled "visitors," and trav- elers under the latter two categories are labeled "tour- ists." Permission for private travel may be obtained once a calendar year. Authorized tourist offices obtain annual foreign exchange allocations for granting allowances to tourist groups. Foreign exchange allowances for travel to countries outside the CMEA may be obtained from the National Bank once every third year. Individual allowances amount to Ft 19,000 a passport holder plus Ft 3,000 a child for children of less than 14 years of age traveling on a parent's passport. Small amounts may also be granted on a case- by-case basis in excess of the basic allowance for personal reasons —for example, if additional transport must be paid for abroad. In general, transportation expenses for "tourists" can be settled in forint for Hungarian carriers or carriers participating in a pooling agreement of which 250 the domestic carrier is a member. Transportation expenses for tourists can be settled in forint for any other carriers using the less expensive fares when the destination of travel cannot be reached by the above-mentioned carriers. The same regulations apply to visitors when traveling by air or long-distance coach. In the case of tourists, a supplementary travel allowance may be obtained for travel by car to cover gasoline expenses up to a quota fixed for each country. Visitors may purchase foreign currencies up to Ft 2,800. For official and business travel, separate allowances are established by the Ministry of Finance for living expenses and accommodation. Limits for living expenses are applied strictly, while accommodation allowances are applied more flexibly to reflect actual reasonable costs. Compliance with these limits is administered by the enterprises or institutions themselves within their allo- cated global foreign exchange quotas and is reviewed, on an ex post basis, by the Ministry of Finance, the chief control administration of the Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank. No m in imum spending or conversion requirement ap- plies to nonresident travelers to Hungary, except in the case of visitors from Yugoslavia, who are required to convert the equivalent of Ft 760 a trip (Ft 380 for residents of the border area) when entering Hungary other than for business purposes. (Yugoslav citizens arriving with an authorized tourist group are, however, not covered by this regulation.) For travel between Hungary and Poland and between Hungary and Czechoslovakia, travelers are required to have in their possession specific minimum amounts of the currency of their country of destination. Nonresidents may take out of the country foreign ex- change assets and economic assets, in addition to their personal effects, without a license from the foreign ex- change authority, provided that they have filled out a "Certified Declaration on Brought-In Assets" on arrival. In addition, nonresidents may not take out of the country articles exceeding the value of Ft 3,00012 (up to Ft 1,000 an article). Within the same overall limits, nonresidents from countries with which an agreement is in force for the reciprocal exchange of currencies (CMEA members, except Cuba and Viet Nam) may take out of the country gifts up to Ft 300 a person, as well as purchased articles up to 50 percent of the amount brought into Hungary under the certification of the nonresident's foreign ex- change authority. However, nonresidents may take out freely articles bought in shops designated for sales in convertible currencies. Residents may, without a license from the foreign exchange authority, bring into or take out of the country domestic currency in an amount not exceeding Ft 400 a person, in denominations not exceeding Ft 100; the corresponding limit for nonresidents is Ft 100 per person. Limits of Ft 50 a person apply to both residents and 12 In border traff ic, the value may not exceed Ft 200 a month unless otherwise authorized under international agreement. ©International Monetary Fund.

Special exchange regulations apply to travel to CMEA countries as follows: in addition to the Ft 400 that may be taken out of the country in forint and converted at the travel destination, residents traveling to CMEA countries are entitled to an annual allowance of Ft 20,000, for which they can buy the traveler's checks and bank notes of the country of destination. All conversions are effected at the rate of exchange quoted by the National Bank for the relevant currency. A 4.5 percent commission is applied at the time of conversion. By multilateral agreement, no reconversion of forint acquired by CMEA tourists into their own national currency is allowed. Tourists from the convertible cur- rency area can reconvert up to the equivalent of US$100, provided that the reconversion is for not more than half of the amount originally converted into forint. No foreign exchange is made available for study abroad. Students' living expenses and tuition fees while abroad must be covered by scholarships or financial support from nonresident relatives. Transfers abroad by nonresident workers in Hungary, other than those employed in joint ventures, are determined on the basis of agreements between domestic and foreign institutions or enterprises. Nonresident employees of joint ventures may transfer abroad up to 50 percent of their income. Twenty percent of wages earned by Hungarian private citizens working abroad must be transferred to Hungary and converted into forint. Capital All foreign borrowing, excluding foreign borrowing on the basis of intergovernmental agreements, requires the approval of the National Bank. This approval is given only in exceptional circumstances —for example, when credits on favorable terms are guaranteed by the govern- ment of the exporter or when bankers' acceptances are provided on favorable terms. The requirements of the economy for foreign credit are met through direct foreign borrowing by the National Bank; the aim is to prevent Hungarian enterprises from circumventing the regulations of domestic credit policy by means of foreign resources. Directives for extending short-term commercial credits in connection with foreign trade activities have been established jointly by the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Foreign Trade, and the President of the National Bank. No license from the foreign exchange authority is required for commercial credits in compliance with the directives. Medium-term and long-term credits for the export of investment goods may be extended by exporting enter- prises with the authorization of the Minister of Foreign Trade. Negotiable export documents are discounted by the National Bank. These credits are refinanced by the National Bank from its own resources. Foreign investment in the form of joint ventures with Hungarian enterprises may be established, subject to the approval of the Minister of Finance. Joint ventures may HUNGARY also be established in duty-free zones. In both cases the joint venture is considered as a Hungarian legal entity, but those in duty-free zones are not subject to several regulations. Foreign participation is limited in general to 49 percent, but a higher proportion may be allowed in the banking and service sectors. In other sectors, foreign majority requires special permission of the Minister of Finance. Machines and equipment, technical know-how, and patents may qualify as part of foreign investment. The profit tax rate for joint ventures in the production sphere and in the hotel building and hotel trade is 20 percent in the first five years of operation and 30 percent thereafter, provided that the equity capital exceeds Ft 25 mil- lion and the foreign partner's ownership exceeds 30 percent; this compares with a generally applied profit tax rate of 40 percent. The reinvestment of profits is encouraged by a profit tax cut of 75 percent if all profit is reinvested, and 50 percent if one half is reinvested. Joint ventures in preferred lines of production are ex- empted from the profit tax for five years and pay 20 percent thereafter. Customs duties on real assets brought into joint ventures can be deferred for five years. Guar- antee is given for the transfer of the foreign investors' share of profits or, in the case of liquidation of the joint ven ture, of the invested capital. In addition, a guarantee may be obtained from the National Bank covering losses on invested assets as a result of state measures, or from Hungarian banking institutions covering the fulfillment of obligations of the Hungarian partner. Foreign investment by resident economic organiza- tions, either by establishing subsidiaries or affiliates or by acquiring an interest in a foreign enterprise, is subject to the approval of the head of the competent sectoral authority. In addition, approval is required from the Minister of Finance in his capacity as the foreign exchange authority. Except for gifts with a market value of up to Ft 800, the transfer of economic assets abroad by residents is subject to licensing administered by the National Bank. Gifts (movable property) from nonresidents in excess of Ft 25,000 a person are also subject to licensing. Nonres- idents are not generally allowed to acquire real estate, buildings, or other immovable property in Hungary, except in the form of inheritance. Outward capital transfers by resident physical persons are not generally approved. For certain established cat- egories, such as inheritances, transfers may be authorized on the basis of agreements and reciprocity with other countries, subject to the control of the Central Corporation of Banking Companies. Emigrants may take out of the country, up to Ft 60,000 an adult and Ft 30,000 a child, silver objects weighing no more than 1 kilogram, and gold and jewelry considered to be personal effects. Other assets of emigrants, as well as the assets of nonresidents, are held either in the care of a person designated by the nonresident owner or, in the case of financial assets, in a nonresident blocked forint account or blocked deposit. 251 ©International Monetary Fund.

Any economic enterprise with exports in con- vertible currencies of more than US$1 million in the previous year will be authorized to engage in foreign trade (export and import) of any product, except those on the negative list. This regulation increased the number of enterprises with general trading rights to 101 (including the 40 specialized foreign trade organizations). In addition, certain items were removed from the negative list. Nonresident Accounts October 1. The limit (in forint) on foreign exchange deposits was terminated.

Not for Redistribution ICELAND (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Iceland is the Icelandic Krona, the exchange rate of which is determined on the basis of a trade-weighted basket of currencies. There is no organized foreign exchange market in Iceland, and official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the principal trading and reserve currency, are quoted by the Central Bank of Iceland. These rates are adjusted from time to t ime. On December 31, 1987 the buy ing and selling rates were ISK 35.60 and ISK 35.72, respectively, per US$1. Rates for other currencies1 are based on the official rates for the U .S. dollar and the dollar rates for the currencies concerned in international markets. The banks are per- mitted to carry out exchange transactions among them- selves and to engage in arbitrage in foreign markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Iceland formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from September 19, 1983. Administration of Control The Ministry of Commerce, after consulting with the Central Bank, has the ultimate responsibility for matters concerning import and export2 regulations and paymen ts for invisibles. The Central Bank is responsible for the regulation of foreign exchange transactions and of ex- change control, including capital controls; it is also responsible for ensuring that all foreign exchange due to residents from commercial transactions is surrendered to authorized banks and that such foreign exchange is disposed of as authorized. Three commercial banks (the National Bank of Iceland, the Fisheries Bank of Iceland, and the Agricultural Bank of Iceland), previously the only fu l ly authorized banks, were joined in 1984 and 1985 by private banks and the major savings banks. Prescription of Currency All exchange receipts must be obtained in convertible currencies. Settlements w i th countries whose currencies are usually tied to the U .S. dollar, and with several other countries in Eastern and Southern Europe, as well as outside Europe, are made in U.S. dollars. Settlements with countries of the former Sterling Area and some other countries are made in sterling; and those with other countries are made in their respective currencies. Nonresident Accounts There are two categories of nonresident krona accounts with the authorized banks: Foreign Accounts and Special Accounts. The opening of nonresident accounts requires individual approval. Foreign Accounts may be credited with the proceeds from the sale of foreign currency to banks and with authorized payments due to nonresidents from residents. Balances on Foreign Accounts may be used freely for payments to residents and may, without a license, be converted into the currency of the country of residence of the account holder. These accounts are, in practice, seldom used, payments for international transactions generally being made in U.S. dollars, sterling, or other convertible currencies.3 Special Accounts in kronur or foreign currency may be opened by agreement with an Icelandic bank. The most important of these accounts are those of foreign banks and foreign insurance companies. They may be credited freely with approved payments from residents. Imports and Import Payments All goods not on the restricted list may be imported freely without an import license from any country; most imports are liberalized. The main commodities on the restricted list are petroleum products, fishing vessels, certain agricultural goods, and specified brooms and brushes. Certain imports, including fertilizers, tobacco, matches, and alcoholic beverages, can be ordered freely but admitted only under state-trading arrangements. Some fresh vegetables, potatoes, and flowers are subject to periodic import control. For imports from all sources, where a license is re- quired, a fee of 1 percent is assessed on the krona value of the import license when the license is issued. Petroleum products and fishing vessels are subject to licensing, but no fee is assessed. Importers of goods not requiring licenses are not required to obtain a foreign exchange permit prior to shipment from abroad, but import documentation must be presented to one of the authorized banks to obtain foreign exchange. For imports that require an individual license, foreign exchange is granted in accordance with the terms stipulated in the license. Importers may freely obtain suppliers' credits for up to three mon ths from the date of shipment arrival at an Icelandic port for listed goods corresponding to about 1 Aus t r ian sch i l l ings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish k rone r, deu tsche mark, F inn ish markkaa, French f rancs, Irish pound s, Italian lire, Japanese y en, Ne the r lands guilders, Norwegian k rone r, Portuguese escudos, pounds s ter l ing, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 2 E f fec t ive January 1, 1988, matters concern ing exports were transferred from the M in i s t ry of Commerce to the M in i s t ry of Foreign Affa irs. 3 Residents who hold foreign currency that they are not required to sell to authorized dealers may open Foreign Accounts w i th Icelandic banks. Exporters can similarly deposit, up to six mon ths, foreign exchange proceeds in identical accounts to meet foreign exchange outlays in their business. Such accounts, denominated in Danish kroner, deutsche mark, pounds sterling, and U.S. dollars, may be credited with authorized receipts in foreign currencies and may be debited for authorized paymen ts in foreign currencies. 253 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ICELAND two thirds of the value of imports; the goods not listed are mainly certain building materials, household appli- ances, motor vehicles for personal use, and nonessential goods. Credits in excess of 3 months and not exceeding 12 months are permitted to be obtained in respect of some categories of goods and materials, for example, in connection with the import of industrial raw materials for which the production process is lengthy. Foreign credits in excess of 12 months are subject to rules issued by the Ministry of Commerce. Import documentation on credit terms must be presented to one of the banks at the same time as customs clearance. Automobiles are subject to a special import tax ranging between zero and 32 percent, depending on the weight of the vehicle or the engine capacity. Buses, heavy trucks, ambulances, and public service vehicles are exempt. Certain nonessential goods, whether of imported or of domestic origin, are subject to a special excise tax of 24 percent or 30 percent, ad valorem. A specific import tax applies to wines and spirits, with the amount of tax dependent on alcohol content and volume. Payments for Invisibles No exchange license is required for government pay- ments (such as interest and amortization on external loans, expenses of the foreign service, payments to international organizations, payments for postal, tele- graphic, and telephone services), for banking commis- sions, or for bank charges on foreign exchange transactions. The banks effect payments freely on most transactions on the basis of bona fide documents. There is an exchange license fee of 1 percent for all payments for invisibles. The basic foreign exchange allocation for tourist travel is the equivalent of US$2,000 a person for each trip abroad (US$1,000 for each child). Applications for foreign ex- change for chartering of ships and aircraft, for major repairs of ships and aircraft, for transactions and transfers in connection with direct insurance, and for insurance operations abroad are considered on their merits. Resident and nonresident travelers may take out ISK 8,000 in Icelandic bank notes in any denominations. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of fisheries and agricultural products require licenses issued by the Ministry of Commerce. The ship- ping documents must be lodged with an Icelandic bank. Exchange receipts accruing from exports must be surren- dered within a period of 180 days from shipment. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles of a commercial nature must be surrendered. The owners of Icelandic ships and aircraft are permitted to retain their foreign exchange receipts from freight, passenger tickets, or other charges and to use them for operating purposes and for purchases of necessities. Icelandic insurance companies that reinsure abroad are permitted to retain foreign ex- change earned from premiums and indemnities and to use 254 it to pay reinsurance prem iums, claims, and other regular expenditures. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in Ice- landic bank notes up to ISK 8,000 in all denominations. Capital All inves tmen ts by nonresidents are subject to individ- ual approval. Rules concerning Icelandic joint-stock com- panies, which are laid down in Law No. 32/1978, require the majority of the founders of a joint-stock company to have been domiciled in Iceland for the preceding two years. No conditions are imposed w i th regard to Icelandic nationality of the founders; but the right of foreigners to direct or own shares in joint-stock companies is governed by legal provisions that are different for the various types of economic activities. The director or directors of the branch office must be domiciled in Iceland; and, as a rule, they must be Icelandic citizens. Participation by nonresidents in fishing, power, and mining industries is limited; a lum inum plants, which are wholly owned by nonresidents, are a special exception. Non-resident-owned foreign capital entering in the form of foreign exchange must be surrendered; nonresidents may be authorized to open nonresident accounts for such fund s, in which case their retransfer abroad is permitted. Residents are obliged to surrender foreign exchange accruing to them on account of capital transactions and payments. Without the approval of the Government, residents may not obtain loans abroad, including loans for financing imports, for periods exceeding one year. Applications for the contracting of financial credits and loans abroad for a period of less than one year are considered on their merits. The regulations on foreign borrowing, purchase leasing, and financial leasing of capital goods require that 30 percent of the contract value be financed domestically; this ratio is 40 percent if the transaction is guaranteed by a domestic commercial bank, savings bank, insurance company, or a public inves tment fund. The same require- ment for domestic financing applies to foreign borrowing by businesses for general purposes. A tax is imposed on foreign loans and lease agreements. The tax rate is 1 percent for agreements with terms of 6 months or less, 2 percent for agreements with terms of between 6 and 12 mon ths, and 3 percent for agreements with terms of longer than 12 months. Transfers of capital abroad by residents require indi- vidual approval. Direct investments abroad by domestic businesses are permitted for certain purposes. Direct investments abroad for the purpose of promoting the marketing of Icelandic products are normally permitted. Portfolio inves tmen ts abroad by residents are subject to license. Outward transfers of inheritances, legacies, and emigrants' assets are subject to license and are allowed up to an annual ceiling. Icelandic emigrants may transfer up to ISK 400,000 a person at the time of departure. Half of their holdings, including proceeds of real estate, may be transferred upon presentation of evidence of permanent residency in a ©International Monetary Fund.

Nonresidents may acquire Icelandic securities and other assets with imported fund s; the transfer abroad of the proceeds from their sale requires authorization. Securities held in Iceland by nonresidents must be registered with the Foreign Exchange Control of the Central Bank, and all transactions concerning them are subject to licensing. The import and export of securities by residents require central bank approval. Gold A commemorative gold coin with a face value of ISK 100 is legal tender but does not circulate. Residents may hold and acquire gold in Iceland, subject to certain legal requirements. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Changes During 1987 Payments for Invisibles March 1. The basic foreign exchange allocation for tourist travel was increased to the equivalent of US$2,000 a person for each trip (US$1,000 for each child). Capital May 25. The regulations on foreign borrowing and financial leasing were liberalized. The new regulations ICELAND included an expanded list of capital goods in business operations that can be financed with foreign borrowing; purchase leasing was permitted. Domestic commercial banks, savings banks, insurance companies, or public investment funds could not guarantee contract for pur- chase leasing or financial leasing. Residents were per- mitted to borrow overseas 100 percent of contract value of capital goods on the list as long as the transaction is not guaranteed by a domestic commercial bank, savings bank, insurance company, or a public investment fund, in which case, 67 percent of contract value may be borrowed. July 10. A tax on foreign loans and lease agreements was introduced. The tax rate is 1 percent of contract value for agreements with terms of 6 months and less, 2 percent for agreements with terms of between 6 and 12 months, and 3 percent for agreements with terms of longer than 12 months. August 13. The amount which Icelandic emigrants were allowed to transfer at the time of departure was increased from ISK 250,000 to ISK 400,000 a person. September 24. The rules on foreign borrowing, purchase leasing, and financial leasing of capital goods in business operations were tightened. Henceforth, 30 percent of the contract value must be financed domestically, and this ratio would be 40 percent if the transaction is guaranteed by a domestic commercial bank, savings bank, insurance company, or a public investment fund. The same require- ment of domestic financing was also extended to foreign borrowing by businesses for general purposes. 255 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA (Position on December 37, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of India is the Indian Rupee. Exchange rates are computed from the value of the rupee, which is determined on the basis of the relationship of the rupee to a weighted basket of currencies of India's major trading partners. India maintains the relationship of the rupee to the basket of currencies within margins of 5 percent of the value adopted as the basis. Exchange rates of the rupee in terms of the pound sterling, the intervention currency, are accordingly fixed periodically by the Re- serve Bank of India; on December 30, 1987 they were Rs 23.86 buying and Rs 23.94 selling, per £ stg. 1. Exchange rates for spot and forward purchases of deutsche mark, Japanese yen, and U.S. dollars are based on the latest available rates and trends in international markets and are announced by the Reserve Bank every day; such rates may be changed at any time, if the need arises. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the cross rate of the pound sterling w i th the Indian rupee. The Reserve Bank stands ready to purchase currencies of certain member countries1 of the Asian Clearing Union (ACU), deutsche mark, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, and U.S. dollars, spot and forward, and to sell spot ACU currencies, pounds sterling, and U.S. dollars. The Reserve Bank permits authorized dealers and authorized money changers to fix the floor and ceiling rates for purchases and sales of U.S. dollar and pound sterling notes on the basis of a formula furnished by the Bank. The Reserve Bank fixes periodically the "notional" exchange rates for the U.S. dollar and pound sterling at which authorized dealers are required to sell to and repurchase from the Reserve Bank receipt/remittances on account of deposits in the Foreign Currency (Nonres- ident) Account Scheme. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized dealers are permitted to maintain balances and positions in "permitted currencies." Permitted cur- rencies are divided into two groups, Group A consisting of 20 listed currencies,2 and Group B consisting of any other foreign currencies that are convertible into any of the permitted currencies in fairly active markets. Au- thorized dealers are also permitted to maintain abroad balances and positions in ECUs. Authorized dealers are permitted to buy and sell spot any permitted currency from and to banks in any currency outside the Bilateral Group.3 Authorized dealers are also permitted to buy and 1 Bangladesh, Burma, Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

Forward purchase or sale of foreign currencies against rupees with banks abroad is prohibited. On December 30, 1987 market rates for telegraphic transfers in New York were US$7.78 buy ing (clean) and US$7.74 selling, per Rs 100; and the Reserve Bank's spot buy ing rate for U.S. dollars was US$7.80 and its forward buy ing rates were US$7.81, US$7.80, and US$7.81, per Rs 100 (for 1, 3, and 12 mon ths' delivery, respectively). The Reserve Bank provides forward cover to authorized dealers by purchases of pounds sterling for delivery on any day during the first mon th, second mon th, etc., up to 9 months' delivery initially (and extendable up to 12 mon ths), for purchases of U.S. dollars up to 12 months, and of deutsche mark and Japanese yen for delivery on any day during the first mon th, second mon th, and so on, up to the sixth mon th. Thus, the forward contracts are on a monthly option basis, i.e., with options to deliver the amount on any day from the first to the last day of the mon th in which contract is due for delivery. In addition, the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. (ECGC) provides protection against exchange fluctuation in respect of deferred receivables from the date of a bid up to 15 years after the award of contract; exchange cover is offered in Australian dollars, French francs, deutsche mark, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, and U .A .E. dirhams. For paymen ts specified in other convertible currencies, cover is provided at the discrection of ECGC. The Reserve Bank also purchases the currencies of the ACU member countries listed in footnote 1 from authorized dealers for delivery of up to six mon ths on a mon th ly option basis. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank in accordance w i th the general policy laid down by the Governmen t, in consultation w i th the Reserve Bank. Much of the routine work of exchange control is delegated to certain commercial banks, which act as authorized dealers. All proposals for foreign direct inves tment in India are reviewed by the Foreign Inves tment Board. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Ac t, the general or specific approval of the Reserve Bank is necessary for the continuance of commercial, indus tr ia l, and trading activities in India of companies incorporated abroad, or w i th more than 40 percent nonres ident in teres t, or for the establishment by them in India of any branch, office, or other place of business for carrying out any such ac t iv i ty.

Prescription of Currency For prescription of currency purposes, countries are divided into two groups: the Bilateral Group of countries (see footnote 3) and the Ex ternal Group of countries (all ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution other countries). Paymen ts to and from the Bilateral Group of countries must be settled in Ind ian rupees through the appropriate clearing account. Payments to the External Group of countries may be made in rupees to the account of a resident of any coun try in the group or in any permitted currency .4 Receipts from the External Group of countries may be obtained in rupees from the account of a bank situated in any country in the group or in any permitted currency. However, special rules may be applicable in respect of exports under lines of credit extended by the Government of India to the governmen ts of certain foreign countries. In addition, all paymen ts on account of current interna- tional transactions (other than trave l, export, and import transactions (1) involving settlement on deferred payment terms, and (2) financed out of loans from international financial institutions under bilateral lines of credit, and imports into Bangladesh under the Wage Earners' Scheme) between India and other members of the ACU (see footnote 1), except Nepal, are required to be settled through the ACU arrangement. Nonresident Accounts The accounts of Indians and of Bhutanese and Nepalese nationals resident in Bhu tan and Nepal, as well as the accounts of offices and branches of Ind ian, Bhu tanese, and Nepalese firms, companies, or other organizations in Bhutan and Nepal, are treated as resident accounts.5 Accounts related to all other foreign countries are treated as nonresident accounts. The trea tment of these accounts distinguishes between banks and others. The accounts of banks are classified in to two groups corresponding to the division of countries for prescription of currency purposes —that is, the accounts of banks in the Bilateral Group of countries and the accounts of banks in the External Group of countries. Accounts of banks in the External Group of countries may be credited with payments for imports, interest, dividends, and other authorized purposes; w i th authorized transfers from the nonresident accounts of persons and firms (including banks), provided that both the transferor and the trans- feree accounts are of the same country or countries in 4 All remittances by nationals of the People's Repub l ic of China to any coun try outside India and all rem i t tances to the People's Republic of China by any person resident in Ind ia, whe ther for personal or trade purposes, were prohibited w i th effect from November 3, 1962.

These accounts may also be debited for transfers to nonresident accounts of persons and firms (including banks) and transfers to Nonresident (External) Accounts, provided that both the transferor and transferee accounts are of the same country or of countries in the External Group. The balances in the accounts of banks in countries in the External Group may be converted into any per- mitted currency. All other entries on bank accounts require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. Ordinary nonresident accounts of individuals or firms may be credited, without prior approval, for payment of dividends and interest on securities, shares, and deposits; re funds of amounts previously debited or overcharged; proceeds of remittances in appropriate foreign currency or transfers from appropriate nonresident banks' rupee accounts (see section on Prescription of Currency, above); proceeds of foreign exchange tendered by the account holder during a temporary visit to India; proceeds from checks issued by the Life Insurance Corporation in respect of maturity or death claims and the surrender value of policies held by nonresidents, provided that the Corpo- ration certifies that premiums had been received in India in an approved manner and that actuarial reserves were held in India; all legitimate dues accruing in India to the account holder, such as pensions, provident fund s, gra- tuities, bonuses from a former employer, income tax refunds, etc.; and proceeds of checks, provided that the aggregate of such credits during a month does not exceed Rs 2,000 and no individual credit is in excess of Rs 750.

Indian emigrants may maintain ordinary non- resident accounts, as may overseas corporate bodies or trusts in which at least 60 percent ownership or beneficial interest is held directly or indirectly but ultimately by nonresident Indians, and provided that the initial deposit for opening such an account by these bodies or trusts is made from remittances abroad or from funds in India otherwise eligible for credit to these accounts. When the account holder is a foreign national of Indian origin, authorized dealers may credit the sale and maturity proceeds of all types of securities and the repurchase price of un i ts, provided that the securities were originally purchased either with funds held in the account or by remittance from abroad, and, in the case of sale proceeds, that the sale was made on a stock exchange.

Nonresident (External) Accounts may be opened by authorized dealers in India for persons of Indian nation- ality or origin resident outside India or for overseas companies and partnership firms of which at least 60 percent is owned by nonresidents of Indian nationality or origin. In addition to authorized dealers holding licenses under the 1973 Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, all state cooperative banks and certain urban cooperative banks and scheduled commercial banks not holding such licenses have also been permitted by the Reserve Bank to open and maintain nonresident rupee accounts. Such accounts may also be opened for eligible persons during temporary visits to India against the tender of foreign currency traveler's checks, notes, or coin. They may be credited with new funds remitted through banking chan- nels from the country of residence of the account holder or from any country in the External Group. They may also be credited with the proceeds of foreign currency traveler's checks, personal checks, and drafts in the name of the account holder, as well as foreign currency notes and coin tendered by the account holder during his stay in India, and also with income on authorized investments. The transfer of funds from other Nonresident (External) Accounts or Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts of the same account holder is also allowed. The accounts may be debited for disbursements in India and for transfers abroad. Debits on account for investment in government securities and units of the Un it Trust of India and transfers to other Nonresident (External) Accounts of the same account holder are freely allowed. Balances can also be used for purchases of foreign currency or rupee traveler's checks or traveler's letters of credit for the use of the account holder, his family and dependents, and for the use of directors and employees in the case of corporate entities; but transfers of funds from an individual account to a similar account of another person are ordinarily not permissible. Investments in the shares of Indian companies or in partnership firms, etc., or in immovable property can be made with the specific/ general approval of the Reserve Bank. Interest on deposits in such accounts is exempt from income tax and is transferable. The balances held in such accounts are exempt from the wealth tax. Gifts to close relatives in India from the balances in the accounts are also exempt from the gift tax. These tax exemptions are available only for those accounts maintained by nonresident individuals and not by overseas corporate bodies. 258 Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts denomi- nated in pounds sterling or U.S. dollars may be held in the form of term deposits by persons of Indian nationality or origin who are resident in the External Group of countries and by overseas companies specified above. These accounts may be credited with amounts received through normal banking channels, including interest, which is free of income tax, wealth, and gift tax in respect of accounts maintained by individuals. Balances may be repatriated at any time in the currency of denomination, without reference to the Reserve Bank. Balances can also be used for the purposes for which debits to Non- resident (External) Accounts are allowed. Imports and Import Payments The Imports and Exports (Control) Act of 1947 em- powers the Central Government to prohibit, restrict, or otherwise control imports. Under this Act, the Imports (Control) Order, 1955, was issued, which specifies items subject to controls. All imports require import licenses or a customs clearance permit unless otherwise ex- empted.6 Imports of gold, silver, currency notes, bank notes, and coin are controlled by the Reserve Bank of India. Imports from Namibia (South West Africa), Fiji, and South Africa are prohibited. There are two types of actual user licenses: General Currency Area Licenses and Specific Licenses (used for imports from specified coun- tries). There is a further classification of licenses as follows: Supplementary Licenses, Import Replenishment (REP) Licenses, Capital Goods Licenses, Advance Li- censes, Special Imprest Licenses, Import/Export Pass- book Licenses, Special Imprest Import/Export Passbook Licenses, Imprest Licenses, and Additional Licenses. Licenses issued for capital goods are valid for 2 years, and all other licenses mentioned above are valid for 18 months. The Import Policy for fiscal years 1985/88, which came into effect on April 12, 1985, with its subsequent amend- men ts, contains the policy governing imports. The import policy divides products into three basic categories: con- sumption goods; raw materials, components, consum- ables, tools, and spare parts; and capital goods. Imports of consumption goods are prohibited except for certain essential products that are canalized; consumer durable items are also not allowed to be imported except items that can be imported under the personal baggage scheme by Indians returning from abroad.7 Imports of raw ma- terials, components, and spare parts for industry are classified into three categories: (1) limited permissible, (2) restricted, and (3) canalized. There is also a list of instruments that are permissible for imports against licenses. All items not included on these lists are freely available 6 The exempted category includes government imports under Open General License (OGL), relief supplies, and passenger baggage. 7 Items that can be imported under the personal baggage scheme include air-conditioner un i ts, refrigerators, deep freezers, cooking ranges, washing machines, television sets, tape recorders, record players, movie cameras and projectors, video cassettes, textile fabrics, cigarettes, cigars, and tobacco. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution for imports under Open General License (OGL). Non- resident Indians returning home for permanent settlement may, during the first 12 months after their return, import all raw materials except restricted (nonpermissible) items and canalized items under OGL, subject to a value limit for the purpose of setting up small industries. Supple- mentary licenses may be obtained in case of need, even for the import of limited permissible items. All licenses to industry are generally issued against free foreign exchange, except for imports from the rupee payment area and from countries that are financed with available credits. Special procedures apply to imports of capital goods. Specified capital goods are restricted, while some capital goods listed may be imported under OGL, subject to certain conditions. For other capital goods, licenses are granted subject to prescribed procedure. In general, licenses are granted after it has been certified that such imports are essential ("essentiality certificate"), unavail- able from domestic sources ("indigenous angle clear- ance"), and, where the value of imports exceeds Rs 2.5 million, that the importer has advertised his requirements for a period of 45 days. For 14 industries and projects, capital goods may be imported on the basis of global tenders, whether or not the goods are manufactured in India. However, importers are required to study domestic availability of suitable equipment before calling for tenders. The selection of suppliers on the basis of global tender is subject to scrutiny by a committee headed by the Department of Industrial Development. For imports of capital equipment for power generation, transmission, and distribution, applicants must obtain prior clearance from this committee before calling for global tenders. Subject to specified conditions and relative value restriction, exporters of manufactured goods are entitled to import capital goods against their own and acquired Import Replenishment Scheme (REP) licenses without an essentiality certificate and without indigenous angle clearance. Nonresident Indians returning home for permanent settlement may import capital goods other than restricted items and certain specified items for the purpose of setting up or investing in an enterprise. Under the REP, import licenses are issued to merchant exporters, manufacturer-exporters, export houses, and trading houses, and are freely transferable except for cases in which licenses are issued with actual user conditions. Exporters are able to obtain Advance Licenses (under the Duty Exemption Scheme) or Imprest Licenses or Import/Export Passbook Licenses to import inputs required for export products. The imports under the Duty Exemption Scheme and the Import/Export Passbook Scheme are duty free. The value of such licenses is debited against the REP entitlement. Registered exporters are permitted to obtain REP licenses against export of specified products up to a certain proportion of the value of exports; these licenses are valid for importation of certain limited permissible and canalized items necessary for the production of the particular export product. The REP license entitlement is increased by 10 percent for INDIA exports that are shipped in Indian vessels. Subject to a value limit on individual items, manufacturer-exporters, export houses, and trading houses exporting select prod- ucts of their own manufacture are also allowed to import limited permissible items and canalized items that are related to select products exported or manufactured by them. Where the REP rate is 20 percent or less, import of limited permissible items is available up to 30 percent of the face value of the REP licenses, with a single item limit of Rs 0.15 million. Where the REP rate is more than 20 percent, the import of limited permissible items is allowed up to 25 percent, with a single item limit of Rs 1.5 million. In cases where the REP rate is more than 20 percent and an exporter has exported 50 percent or more of his output of select products with a minimum value of Rs 1.5 million, the import of limited permissible items is allowed up to 25 percent, with a single item value limit up to Rs 0.4 million. Similarly, where the REP rate is 20 percent or more, the import of canalized items is allowed up to 20 percent, subject to a maximum of Rs 0.1 million per item. The limit is 25 percent when the REP rate is 20 percent or less. The percentage of admis- sibility and restriction of the single item value is higher in cases where the export of select products is 25 percent or more of the output. Manufacturer-exporters who have been in production during the preceding three years and have exported 100 percent of their production of select products during the preceding one year are allowed to import any item in the limited permissible list and in the list of canalized items on Acquired Licenses, up to the value of REP licenses issued in favor of the manufacturer-exporter. The items allowed for import are those that are related to the select products being manufactured and exported or select products proposed to be manufactured and exported. Additional licenses based on net foreign ex- change earnings are also available for trading houses and export houses. Trading houses receive additional licenses at a higher rate if they form longer-term relationships with associate manufacturers. Small-scale units are given especially liberal treatment in respect of import licenses, and consortia of small-scale industries may form export houses. Nonindustrial actual users, such as research and development laboratories, scientific or higher educational institutions, and hospitals, are eligible to import their requirements of technical and professional equipment, raw materials, components, spare parts, or other items (but not office machines and consumer goods) under OGL. When a valid import license is held, the required exchange is released by an authorized bank on presen- tation of the exchange control copy of the license and the shipping documents. License holders may make payments by opening letters of credit or by remitting against sight drafts. Use of suppliers' credits and other long-term import credits is subject to prior approval. Advance remittances before shipping documents can be submitted are not normally allowed, but in special cases, for example, imports of machinery and capital goods for 259 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA which deposits have to be made with overseas manufac- turers, the Reserve Bank grants special authorization for advance payment for a part of the value of the import. The importation of certain commodities, including food- grains, certain oil and fa ts, a number of pharmaceutical products, natural rubber, raw cotton, raw ju te, cement, cashew nu ts, most fertilizers, most nonferrous metals, and certain categories of steel, is reserved for the Gov- ernment or state-trading enterprises (i.e., canalized), the most important of which are the State Trading Corporation (STC), the Jute Corporation of India, the Food Corpo- ration of India, the Steel Authority of India, Ltd. (SAIL), and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation. Bulk imports of certain raw materials that are not reserved for the public sector may also be arranged by state agencies, under the Industrial Raw Materials Assistance Center (IRMAC) facility. In addition to any applicable import du ty, imports are subject to an auxiliary duty of up to 40 percent ad valorem, which was raised to 45 percent ad valorem with effect from September 20, 1987. Among the exemptions are foodgrains, raw cotton, and books. Payments for Invisibles In general, payments abroad for invisibles require approval. Foreign exchange is granted freely for a few such payments, mainly for expenses incidental to trade transactions and transfers of recurring contractual obligations. Premiums on insurance policies issued in foreign cur- rency to foreign nationals not permanently resident in India are to be paid only in foreign currency; payment in rupees may be made only on annuities issued against payment from recognized superannuation or pension fund s; Indian residents are prohibited from taking out life insurance policies in foreign currencies. Branches of foreign banks are not allowed to transfer abroad any profits arising from the sale of nonbanking assets. Profit remittances by branches of foreign firms, companies, and banks require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. Remittances of dividends by Indian com- panies to their nonresident shareholders do not require prior Reserve Bank approval, provided that certain con- ditions are met. Otherwise, there are no restrictions on the remittance of profits, dividends, and interest to ben- eficiaries permanently resident outside India, provided that all current tax and other liabilities in India have been cleared. Foreign nationals temporarily resident in India on account of their employment are permitted to make reasonable remittances to their own countries to pay insurance premiums, for the support of their families, and for other expenses. Authorized dealers may allow such remittances by foreign nationals, other than nationals of the People's Republic of China, Pakistan, and South Africa, up to 50 percent of net income. Requests for the remittance of larger amounts are considered on their merits by the Reserve Bank. 260 Under the Foreign Travel Scheme (FTS) of 1970, residents are permitted to travel abroad without "P" form formalities to any country (other than Bhu tan, Nepal, and the countries covered by the Neighborhood Trade Scheme (NTS)), provided that they have not traveled abroad under this scheme during the two calendar years preceding the year of travel. For determination of eligi- bility, all foreign travel other than under the FTS is disregarded. A visit under the FTS can be combined with visits for any other purpose except tours for export promotion and other business matters, hajj pilgrimage, and travel under the NTS. Under the FTS, residents are entitled to foreign exchange up to US$500 or its equivalent and a round-trip ticket, irrespective of the carrier by which they travel. In the case of minor children up to the age of 12, the foreign exchange entitlement is US$250. Authorized travel agents, airlines, and steamship com- panies may book passages under the FTS for any eligible person; foreign exchange for such persons may be released by any authorized dealer. Travel to Bangladesh, Burma, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Pakistan, Seychelles, and Sri Lanka is gov- erned by the NTS, under which residents of India visiting neighboring countries are eligible for an exchange allow- ance of US$250 a person once every three calendar years; this arrangement cannot be combined with the existing FTS. As in the case of FTS, the foreign exchange entitlement for minor children up to the age of 12 is one half of the normal quota for adults. Authorized travel agents, airlines, and steamship com- panies may also book passages for persons going abroad with or without an allocation of foreign exchange (other than under the above schemes), subject only to completion of a "P" form in cases where the passage fare is paid in rupees in India. Certain categories of passengers, includ- ing persons traveling between India and Nepal by Indian and Nepalese airlines, deck-class passengers, and em- ployees of airlines and steamship companies traveling abroad on business for their company in one of its carriers are not required to complete a "P" form. Fares for nonresidents' journeys to and from India may be settled, without Reserve Bank approval, in rupees debited to Nonresident (External) Accounts. The export of Indian currency notes and coin, except to Bhutan and Nepal, is in general prohibited. The export to Nepal of Indian currency notes in denominations of Rs 100 or higher is also prohibited. However, deck-class passengers to Burma, Malaysia, Singapore, ports in cer- tain Middle Eastern countries, and East Africa, and passengers to Bangladesh, Pakistan, or Sri Lanka may each take with them Rs 20 in Indian notes and coin. Exchange bureaus and authorized money changers are permitted to sell foreign currency notes and coin up to the equivalent of Rs 100 to travelers proceeding to Bangladesh and up to US$20 or its equivalent to those proceeding to other countries except Bhutan and Nepal. Nonresidents may take out the foreign currency that they brought in (and declared on entry if it exceeded US$1,000), less the amounts sold to authorized dealers and authorized ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution money changers in India. Unspent rupee amounts may be reconverted into foreign currency and taken out. There is a foreign exchange allowance of up to US$750 a person for settling-in and for purchase of initial equipment by students going to foreign universities with fu ll bursaries. An airport tax at a rate of Rs 100 a passenger is levied on all passengers embarking on an international journey to any destination other than Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhu tan, Burma, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, or Sri Lanka. Passengers to these destinations are required to pay the tax at a rate of Rs 50 a passenger. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required for some items, and most commodities may be exported without a license. In respect of controlled commodities,8 no item can normally be exported unless it is covered by a valid license issued by the concerned licensing authority. Exports to Namibia (South West Africa), Fiji, and South Africa are prohibited. Border trade (i.e., frontier trade) between India and the Tibet region of the People's Republic of China is not allowed. Exchange control is exercised over the proceeds of exports to countries other than Bhutan and Nepal. An exporter must declare that the full export proceeds will be received and dealt with in accordance with the pre- scription of currency regulations. Foreign exchange holdings, including the proceeds of exports, must be offered for sale against rupees to an authorized dealer, unless the holder has been authorized by the Reserve Bank to retain them, or he is a foreign national or a foreign person of Indian origin, or he (or his foreign-born wife) is not permanently resident in India, and the funds do not represent the proceeds of an export. Export proceeds must be surrendered within six months of shipment. Exporters are required to obtain permission from the Reserve Bank of India through authorized dealers in the event of nonrealization of export value w i th in the prescribed period. The Reserve Bank of India also ad- ministers a scheme under which export of engineering goods (capital goods and consumer durables) is allowed under deferred credit arrangements, permitting realization of export value in installments over a period exceeding six months. Some exports are prohibited,9 and others, namely coffee, black pepper, mica scrap and waste, and hides, skins, and leather, are subject to export duties. Some others, including footwear, roasted and salted peanuts, man-made fibers, and live sheep and goats, are subject to minimum prices. A substantial number of exports, mainly new manufactures (such as engineering goods, chemicals, plastic goods, leather goods, sporting goods, marine products, processed food and agricultural prod- 8 The export of certain commodities, including sugar, raw ju te, and several categories of steel, is reserved for the state-trading enterprises. 9 Exports that are prohibited include rock crystal, quartz, some varieties of plants and derivatives, all varieties of forestry foundation and breeder seeds, tallow fat and/or oil of any animal origin, rough (uncut and unset) precious stones, sugar cane, Khandsari sugar, palmyra sugar candy, frogs' legs, jaggery, specified animal skins, and human skeletons. INDIA ucts, handicrafts, textiles, and ju te and coir products) receive cash compensatory support, import duty draw- backs, refund of central excise du ty, and exemptions. Bona fide foreign tourists can, with the approval of customs, take out of India articles purchased with foreign exchange or with rupees acquired against foreign ex- change without a value limit; silverware of up to Rs 200 a person may also be exported on the same basis, subject to a limit of Rs 400 a family. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered within the prescribed period. The import of Indian currency notes and coin is prohibited. However, deck-class pas- sengers from Burma, Malaysia, Singapore, ports in certain Middle Eastern countries, and East Africa, and travelers from Pakistan and Sri Lanka may import into India Rs 20 a person against presentation of evidence that they previously had exported this amount from India. Travelers from Burma, other than deck-class passengers, may bring in Indian currency notes up to Rs 50 an adult and Rs 25 a child between the ages of 12 and 18 years. Travelers from Nepal may bring in up to Rs 75 a person. Foreign currency notes may be brought into India without limit, provided that the total amount brought in is declared to the customs authorities upon arrival if the value of foreign notes, coin, and traveler's checks exceeds US$1,000 or its equivalent. Foreign currency notes may be sold to any authorized dealer in foreign exchange or to any authorized money changer. Capital There are no restrictions on receipt of inward remit- tances from any country through authorized dealers in India; subsequent utilization of such funds in India is, however, subject to approval in most cases. Foreign inves tmen ts, once admitted, are eligible for the same treatment that Indian enterprises receive. Banks in India may borrow freely from their branches and correspondents abroad, provided that borrowings in excess of Rs 2 million are utilized for the purchase of rupees from the Reserve Bank or in the interbank market to finance their normal business operations in India; repayment of such borrowings requires the prior approval of the Reserve Bank and may be effected only when the debtor bank has no outstanding borrowings in India from the Reserve Bank or any other bank. Foreign borrowing by nonbank Indian companies is subject to Reserve Bank approval; permission is granted for any loan that has not been obtained as an official or officially guaranteed credit by the Central Government on the basis of merits. Reserve Bank permission is required for initiating, expanding, or continuing in India any business activity, holding or acquiring shares of any company carrying on a trading, commercial, or industrial activity in India by nonresidents, noncitizens, nonbank companies not incor- porated under Indian law, and Indian companies with 261 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA over 40 percent nonresident interest.10 Foreign investment is governed by the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) of 1973. The Reserve Bank will allow companies having nonresident interest in excess of 40 percent and up to 74 percent to continue their activities depending on the extent to which the company is engaged in "core" industry or export-oriented production, or in manufac- turing activities that require sophisticated technology. Foreign companies can retain a 51 percent nonresident equity as long as their combined core sector production involving application of sophisticated technology and export production accounts for not less than 60 percent of their annual turnover, with a m in imum of 10 percent of exports out of their total annual turnover within a period not exceeding two years from the date of approval by the Reserve Bank. If their combined core sector production, application of sophisticated technology, and export production account for not less than 75 percent of their annual turnover, foreign companies can retain 74 percent nonresident ownership. Companies with exports exceeding 40 percent of the total ex-factory cost of annual production are allowed to operate with 51 percent nonresident equity, and those with export performance exceeding 60 percent of total ex-factory cost of annual production are eligible to retain foreign equity up to 74 percent. Companies that export 100 percent of production may be wholly owned by 10 Persons of Indian nationality or origin who are resident abroad may invest freely in any public or private limited company, in any partnership or proprietorship concern, and in indus tr ia l, manu fac tu r ing, or trade activity (except where the proposed investment is in real estate), provided that the funds required are either remitted from abroad through normal banking channels or are drawn from their Nonresident Accoun ts, provided that an undertaking is given that repatriation of the capital inves ted or the profits and dividends arising therefrom will not be requested, and provided that overall limits on holdings of shares and convertible deben- tures bought through the stock exchange by nonresident Indians (see below) are adhered to. Overseas companies and partnership firms which are owned by the extent of at least 60 percent by nonresidents of Ind ian nationality or origin are also allowed to invest in any public or private limited companies in accordance w i th the above provisions. Nonres ident Indians and overseas companies defined above can use funds der ived from fresh remittances or held in their Nonresident (External) or Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts to (1) make portfolio inves tmen t, w i th repatriation benefit, up to 1 percent of the capital, provided that the ir holdings of shares and convertible debentures held on either a repatriable or nonrepayable basis do not exceed (a) 5 percent of the paid-up capital of the company concerned, or (b) 5 percent of the total paid-up value of each series of debentures issued by the company concerned; (2) inve st freely in National Savings Certificates w i th fu ll repatriation bene f i t; (3) invest up to 40 percent of the new equ i ty capital issued by a company (other than a FERA company) setting up industrial manu fac tu r ing projects, hospitals (including diagnostic centers), hotels of at least three-star category, shipping, software, and oil exploration services with repatriation rights for capital and income, subject to deduction of applicable Indian taxes; and (4) invest up to 74 percent of new inves tmen ts, inc lud ing expansion of existing industrial undertakings in specified priority indus- tries, with free repatriation of such inves tment and income therefrom after deduction of applicable Indian taxes. Such inves tmen ts with repa- triation benefits can also be made in hospitals and three-, four-, or five- star hotels. Nonresident Indians and overseas companies, as defined above, can also place funds with public limited companies in India as deposits, with fu ll repatriation benefits, provided (1) the deposits are made for a period of three years; (2) the deposits are made in conform i ty with the prevailing rules and w i th in the limits prescribed for acceptance of deposits by such companies; and (3) the funds are made available by the depositors by remittance from abroad or by payment from their Nonresident (External) or Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts. Special tax concessions are applicable to inves tmen ts by nonresident Indians. 262 nonresidents. Companies engaged predominantly in trad- ing activities, or not meeting the other criteria listed above, have been required to reduce their foreign share- holding to 40 percent within a specified period, or change their activities to meet the above criteria. Branches of foreign companies other than airlines, shipping compa- nies, and liaison offices must in all cases become Indian companies. All companies are subject to "dilution" formulas, as follows: companies with foreign direct holdings exceeding 75 percent must raise 40 percent of the estimated cost of expansion through additional equ i ty capital issued to Ind ians; for companies with foreign holdings above 60 percent but below 75 percent and above 51 percent but below 60 percent, the corresponding equity is per- mitted in companies engaged predominantly in internal trading and commercial activities. W i thout the permission of the Reserve Bank, residents are prohibited from lending to, or depositing money w i th, a nonbank firm or company in which the nonresident interest is more than 40 percent. Noncitizens, non-Indian companies, and nonbank Indian firms with more than 40 percent foreign participation must obtain Reserve Bank permission in order to acquire, hold, transfer, or dispose of immovable property within India (except when a lease for a period of not more than five years is involved). The prior approval of the Reserve Bank is also required for all transfers of shares of Indian companies by nonresidents or foreign nationals to other persons, whether resident or nonres iden t. However, the sale and transfer of shares of Indian companies through stock exchanges in India by nonresidents of Indian na- tionality or origin in favor of citizens of India or persons of Indian origin and Indian companies in which nonresi- dent interest does not exceed 40 percent do not require the Reserve Bank's clearance, where the proceeds of such shares sold by the transferor are credited to his ordinary nonresident rupee account with a bank author- ized to deal in foreign exchange in India w i thout a right of repatriation outside India. Residents are prohibited, except with Reserve Bank permission, from engaging in any transaction that in- creases beyond 49 percent the nonresident share of a business outside India in which the nonresident interest is 49 percent or less; and they are also prohibited, except with Reserve Bank permission, from holding, acquiring, transferring, or disposing of immovable property outside India (except where a lease of not more than five years is invo lved). Residents also require Reserve Bank ap- proval to transfer any interest in a business in India to a nonresident, a noncitizen, a nonbank company not in- corporated under Indian law, or an Indian company with over 40 percent foreign participation. Furthermore, Re- serve Bank approval is required for residents exporting Indian securities and transferring Indian securities to nonresidents. Residents are prohibited, except with cen- tral government or Reserve Bank permission, from guar- anteeing the obligation of a nonresident or the obligation of a resident in favor of a nonres iden t, and are also prohibited, except with central government permission, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution from associating with or participating in any business concern outside India. Capital invested in approved projects after January 1, 1950 by residents of other countries, inc lud ing capital appreciation on the original inve s tmen t, may be repa- triated at any time. However, Reserve Bank approval must be obtained before effec t ing a sale that involves repatriation of assets. The proceeds of approved sales are allowed to be remitted in no more than four annual installments. The proceeds from liquidated foreign in- vestments not eligible for repatriation are kept in a nonresident account. Indian nationals are not normally granted any foreign exchange facilities for emigration purposes. In cases of exceptional hardship, foreign exchange may be released up to a reasonable amount in one lump sum at the time of emigration; the remainder of the emigrant's assets and income is kept in a nonresident account, and no fu r ther remittances, including pensions, if any, are allowed. However, Indian nationals who left the coun try perma- nently before the introduction of exchange controls in India (i.e., July 1947, in the case of the erstwhile Sterling Area countries, and September 1939, in the case of other countries) are permitted to transfer abroad capital assets up to the equivalent of Rs 1 million in one lump sum, and the remaining balance in annual installments not exceeding Rs 250,000. Foreign nationals who are tem- porarily resident in India (other than nationals of the People's Republic of China, Pakistan, and South Africa) are permitted at the time of their retirement to transfer to their own countries the proceeds from the sale of their inves tmen ts, subject to a limit of Rs 500,000 for each family at the time of retirement, and the remainder in annual installments not exceeding Rs 250,000; in addition, they may transfer all their current remittable assets in India. There are no restrictions on the import into India of Indian or foreign securities. The acquisition, sale, transfer, export, or other disposal of foreign securities requires approval. Residents (other than foreign nationals tem- porarily but not permanently resident in India and their foreign-born wives also not permanently resident in India) who are private persons are not normally permitted to purchase securities or personal real estate outside India. Foreign-born widows of Indian nationals are permitted to transfer abroad their capital assets plus current income up to the equivalent of Rs 500,000 in one lump sum, and the remainder in annual installments not exceeding Rs 250,000. Transfers abroad of legacies, inheritance, and bequests by persons who never were residents of India are subject to the same limits. Indian nationals and persons of Indian origin holding foreign passports resident abroad and wishing to re turn to India to secure suitable employment, start a profes- sional practice, or set up small-scale industrial un i ts are, upon application, exempted for a period of five years from the date of their return to India from the requirement that any foreign currency balances in their possession be surrendered within three months of arrival. As an alter- INDIA native to holding such balances in the form of foreign currency, holders may use the funds for the import of machinery, raw materials, and components, subject to an import license, or, in small amounts, for personal require- ments. Furthermore, they have the option of surrendering their balances immediately, with the right to reacquire them w i th in five years should they decide to return to a foreign country. Balances held in Nonresident (External) Accounts or Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts in India by such persons on the date of their return to India are also eligible for similar retransfer or reconversion facilities. These various facilities are not available in respect of earnings arising from employment abroad with any Indian-owned organization. Foreign nationals not permanently residing in India are permitted to maintain foreign currency accounts; this permission is also ex- tended to foreign nationals of Indian origin who have come to India for employment of a specified duration or for an assignment not exceeding three years. Under the Returning Indians Foreign Exchange Enti- tlement Scheme, persons of Indian nationality or origin returning to India for permanent residence are entitled to avail themselves of foreign exchange to the extent of 50 percent of the amount they brought in on transfer of residence, plus the balance held in their Nonresident (External) Accounts and Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts for certain specified purposes for which ex- change is normally not freely available. Persons eligible under the scheme may make use of the exchange facility within a period of ten years from the date of return of the head of the family. Gold Detailed control is exercised over the acquisition, possession, manufacture, and disposal of gold through the Administration of Gold (Control) Act. There is a ban on private possession of primary gold. Although there is no ban on possession of finished articles of gold (including coin) previously declared, there are restrictions on their manufacture and acquisition. There is no restriction on the acquisition, disposal, or possession of gold ornaments, except that holdings of such ornaments (which may be of any purity) above specified limits must be declared. The consumption of gold by industrial users is regulated through permits and authorizations. Control is exercised over dealers and goldsmiths through a system of licensing. Gold refining is under state management. The Government Mint is licensed to accept tenders of gold for purposes of ref in ing and conversion into standard gold bars. Forward trading in gold or silver is prohibited; exports of silver bullion, sheets, and plates are banned, and exports of products of silver are subject to quota restrictions. With the exception of jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler, imports of gold in any form by residents other than the monetary authorities require special authorization from the Reserve Bank and are not normally permitted; in certain cases, however, jewelers are permitted to manufacture gold jewelry in bond from imported gold, for export purposes only. 263 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA Under the Gold Jewelry Export Promotion Replenish- ment Scheme, exporters of ornaments and articles made of gold of not less than 0.5833 fineness are entitled to the replenishment by gold (imported by the State Bank of India and supplied at prices set by the Government) against Release Orders issued by the licensing authorities, provided that they satisfy value added and other require- ments of the scheme. A similar scheme for exports of silver jewelry and articles has been introduced with effect from December 8, 1986. Special permission for imports of gold and silver is granted only in exceptional cases where either no foreign exchange transaction is involved or the metals are needed for a particular purpose. Special permission is also granted when the gold or silver is imported for processing and re-export, provided that payment for the import will not be required, that the entire quantity of metal imported will be re-exported in the form of jewelry, and that the value added will be repatriated to India in foreign exchange through an au- thorized dealer. Eligible registered exporters are allowed to import gold findings, mountings, etc., and gold of 18 carats and less for export of plain and studded gold jewelry under advance licensing scheme. Exports of gold in any form other than jewelry produced in India for export with a gold value not exceeding 10 percent of total value, and jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler, subject to certain monetary limits, are prohibited, unless the export is made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. Net export of gold from India is not permitted. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement February 2. The Reserve Bank of India started selling U.S. dollars for spot delivery to authorized dealers subject to the condition that (1) the Reserve Bank would sell a m in imum of US$250,000 (subsequently reduced to US$100,000 with effect from July 20, 1987) and higher amounts in multiples of US$25,000 without a ceiling; and (2) the U.S. dollars purchased from the Reserve Bank would only be used to settle specifically approved trans- actions or comm i tmen ts in U.S. dollars, such as remit- tances to be made on account of imports, dividends, profits, royalty, and technical know-how fees, from India in conformity with existing Exchange Control Regulations. Imports and Import Payments March 1. Customs duties on a number of items primarily affecting manufacturers of capital equipment and elec- tronics were adjusted. September 20. Customs duties on a range of metal products, including copper wire bars, zinc, nickel prod- ucts, tin, and antimony metals, were raised. October 9. Under the advanced licensing schemes, input/output norms for imports of raw cotton against exports of cotton yarn were fixed. December 1. A research and development tax, payable by any industrial concern importing technology, at the rate of 5 percent of the import value was introduced. Payments for Invisibles June 8. A new blanket permit scheme was introduced, which was more broadly based both as to the eligibility of exporters and to the purposes for which foreign exchange can be drawn by holders against their blanket permits (including travel abroad for export promotions). Exports and Export Proceeds April 1. Exports of frogs' legs were banned. August 1. Suspension of raw cotton exports was extended. October 15.

Exchange rates for certain other currencies2 are determined on the basis of the rates in the Bourse for the U.S. dollar and rates for the currencies concerned in international markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. In the Bourse, daily calls for exchange are conducted under the management of Bank Indonesia. Bidding for exchange is restricted to the authorized foreign exchange banks, nonbank financial ins t i tu t ions, and licensed foreign exchange dealers. Bank Indonesia stands willing to trade unlimited amounts of foreign exchange or rupiah with authorized traders at its intervention rates for the day. Bank Indonesia provides to banks and other financial institutions unlimited forward cover in the form of foreign exchange/rupiah swaps at preferential forward premia on foreign exchange to Bank Indonesia, matched by a for- ward purchase at a price more favorable than that ordi- narily available from commercial banks. The facility is provided to cover bona fide offshore borrowing only. The minimum charged by Bank Indonesia for official swaps was 9 percent per annum at the end of December 1987. Administration of Control Administration of the exchange and trade system is entrusted to Bank Indonesia, the Ministry of Trade, the Ministry of Finance, foreign exchange banks, and the customs authorities. Exchange control is administered by Bank Indonesia and the Ministry of Finance. Prescription of Currency Payments and receipts must be effected through the authorized banks and are normally effected in convertible currencies. Indonesia maintains no operative bilateral payments agreements. Nonresident Accounts There are no restrictions on the opening by residents or foreign nationals of accounts in Indonesia in rupiah or foreign currencies with authorized foreign exchange banks. For exchange control purposes, no distinction is made 1 Indonesia forma l ly accepted the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement as from May 7, 1988. 2 Currencies commonly used in Indonesia's international transactions— that is, Australian dollars, Aus t r ian schillings, Belgian f rancs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, Ne ther lands guilders, New Zealand dollars, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. between resident and nonresident accounts. However, if the account holder wishes to withdraw fund s, a letter must be sent to the bank; no checks may be drawn on foreign currency accounts. Imports and Import Payments There is a registry of authorized importers, and an initial deposit is required for registration. Only Indonesian nationals can be authorized as importers, although foreign investors are permitted to import the items required for their own projects. Imports from Angola, Israel, and South Africa are prohibited, as are imports from all sources of most secondhand goods and of specified products. Imports of products within a given product group must have a license from the Ministry of Trade within that group. No restric- tions are placed on the number of licensed importers in each category. Imports of secondhand goods may only be in the form of machinery or factory machinery used for producing export products. Certain categories of agricultural imports, including different categories of food, beverages, and fru i ts, may be imported only by registered importers designated by the Minister of Trade. The procurement policies of companies approved for the importation of f ru i t, alcoholic beverages, chickens, and eggs are evaluated annually by the Government, although explicit quantitative restrictions are not placed on these products. Since January 15, 1987 import controls on certain textiles, steel, and nonsteel metals have been relaxed; however, these products must be imported by designated importers, name ly, approved importers, "importir pro- dusen" (producers allowed to import their inputs for production), PT Krakatau Steel, PT Tambang Timah, and Bulog. On January 15, 1987 the status of importers of scrap paper was changed from approved importers to "importir produsen," and the procedures to obtain the permits by approved importers and "importir produsen" were simplified. Since December 23, 1987 imports of certain food, beverages, fru i ts, certain electronic and electric industrial products, heavy equipment and spare parts, chemical industry products, machines, machine equipment and spare parts, metal industrial products, and motor vehicle spare parts, which were previously conducted by ap- proved importers and/or "importir produsen," have been allowed only for importers with a general importers' identification number (IU). Imports of certain goods remain restricted to approved importers, most of which are state enterprises. Pertamina has a monopoly on the importation of lubricating oil and lubricating fa ts, and PT Dahana, on the importation of ammunition, dynamite, and "selatin ledak." The monop- oly right of PT Krakatau Steel and PT Tambang Timah on the importation of certain metal industrial products 265 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDONESIA has been shifted to IU holders, and certain textiles may also be imported by "importir produsen." The monopoly rights of approved importers remain in effect for the importation of certain heavy equipment and motor vehi- cles, although this right may be transferred to other approved importers. Tariff rates on certain products were adjusted on December 23, 1987. The rates were reduced on 56 prod- ucts, and increased on 91 products (mainly industrial). In addition, some food products were subject to specific import du ty. Import surcharges of up to 30 percent are imposed on certain products. A value-added tax of 10 percent is levied on the c.i.f. value of imported goods, inclusive of import duties. Selected luxury goods may be subject to import duties of higher than 60 percent or to a specific import du ty. Certain products are granted pref- erential duties within the framework of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Imports to Indonesia are subject to preshipment in- spection in the country of origin by private international agencies; the inspection cost is borne by the Indonesian Government. Following inspection, these agencies are required to issue a survey report (LKP) specifying the type, quality, quantity, and estimated cost of the goods, the applicable tariff code, freight charges, import duties, and value-added taxes; in the case of imports without a letter of credit, the LKP must be sent to an Indonesian bank designated by the importer, which in turn must send the bill of lading and the LKP to a foreign exchange bank. In the case of imports under letters of credit, the LKP is sent to the correspondent banks, and after payments of duties (which are determined on the declared c.i.f. value or the c.i.f. value as estimated by private international agencies) and taxes to the bank, the importer is given the bill of lading and the validated LKP, which must be presented to customs for release of the shipment. The Directorate General of Customs and Excise does not examine goods that have an LKP, except those that are valued at less than US$5,000 or are suspected to be illegally imported. Imports of PMA (foreign capital in- vestment) and PMDN (domestic capital investment) must have an LKP. Since May 9, 1987 quality control has been imposed on cement-asbestos sheets, dry batteries, steel slabs, low-voltage electric cord, and electric light bulbs. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Angola, Israel, and South Africa are prohibited, as are exports to all countries of rawhides of cattle, certain categories of unprocessed or low-quality rubber, certain logs and timber, all types of waste paper (from Java and Madura), brass and copper scrap (except from Irian Jay a), iron scrap, steel scrap, fertilizers, rice, antiques of cultural value, and raw rattan. Exports by state enterprises must be effected in vessels operated by Indonesian companies. Certain rubber, plywood, and livestock tool producer-exporters may issue certificates of quality for their products. Beginning May 15, 1987, all exports of wood and wood products must be examined before shipment. Also begin- 266 ning May 18, 1987, exports of sawn-timber and wood products are allowed only by approved exporters. Since October 6, 1987 coffee exports have been subject to international quota. Exports of textile products subject to import quotas in the consuming countries may be effected only by approved textile-exporters, and exporters may transfer their allocated quotas to other approved exporters. Since December 23, 1987 exporters were no longer required to obtain exporter's identification numbers (APE and APET) to carry out export activities. Exporters must still obtain trade permits (SIOP), which are issued by the Ministry of Trade. Exports of certain domestically produced commodities are controlled by means of quotas, or a requirement of prior authorization from the Ministry of Trade in order to maintain supplies to meet domestic demand and to encourage domestic processing of certain raw materials.3 Concern with domestic price stability sometimes involves suspension of exports of various items on this list. Prior authorization of the Minister of Trade is required for exports of flatbark crepe, cinchona bark, clove seeds, pepper seeds, silver exported by PN Aneka Tambang, and all goods produced from subsidized raw materials. All other commodities may be freely exported by regis- tered private firms and state-trading firms, except for exports of plywood, which need approval from the joint- marketing body for plywood exports. There are no restrictions on the type of financial arrangement exporters may use. There is no surrender requirement for export proceeds. In the calculation of export taxes on the principal commodities other than petroleum and gas, sale prices must not be lower than the "indicative" prices determined periodically by the Minister of Trade. Exports of certain products are subject to an export tax: palm oil, coconut oil, and a few other commodities are subject to a 5 percent tax; the major mineral products (excluding bauxite ore and concen- trates), to a 10 percent tax; and semiprocessed rattan and natural sands, to a 20 percent tax. A few products are also subject to an additional export tax, ranging from 0.75 percent to 20.8 percent. Export taxes and additional export surtaxes are col- lected by foreign exchange banks and transferred weekly to the account of the state general treasurer at Bank Indonesia. For exports based on letters of credit, taxes are settled at foreign exchange banks at the time of negotiation of export bills; for exports without letters of credit, taxes are settled at the time of registration of export notification. For exports with consignment and usance letters of credit, taxes may be collected at the time of receipt of payment from abroad by foreign exchange banks or w i th in 180 days from registration of export notification at the foreign exchange bank. To make available to exporters inputs priced at inter- national levels, a scheme has been set up that permits 3 Items affected by such controls include logs, fer t i l izer, cemen t, construction reinforcements of iron, automobile t i res, paper, asphalt, stearin, cattle, salt, wheat flour, sugar, maize, soybeans, rice, copra, coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, olein, raw ra t tan, and meat. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution exporters and suppliers of inputs for exporters to bypass the import licensing system and import tariffs or, if they cannot bypass the system, to reclaim import du t ies; the costs imposed by nontariff barriers, however, cannot be rebated.4 Certain commodities produced in border regions may be exported to Malaysia and the Philippines in exchange for certain eligible goods. In this "border-crossing" trade with Malaysia, the value of import or export transactions must not exceed M$600 a mon th, whether transported overland or by sea; for the Philippines, the value of imports or exports must not exceed the rupiah or peso equivalent of US$150 for a single trip if transported by seagoing vessel, or US$1,500, if transported by smaller boats. Since January 1982, the Indonesian Government has, at its option, required all foreign firms bidding for gov- ernment-sponsored construction or procurement projects to agree to fu lf i ll a counterpurchase obligation.5 Bidders for projects that include counterpurchase requirements must submit w i th their bids a letter agreeing to purchase and export the equivalent of the contract's value in selected Indonesian products (f.o.b.) during the life of the contract.6 Goods eligible to be used in meeting the counterpurchase requirement include agricultural prod- ucts, manufac tured, and other products, excluding petro- leum, natural gas, and items subject to export quotas. Lists of eligible products and services are issued period- ically by the Department of Trade. Exports of labor services may also be used to fu l f i ll counterpurchase obligations. The foreign supplier may fu lf i ll the counter- purchase requirement either directly or through a third party, possibly from another coun try that is acceptable to the Indonesian Governmen t. Such an arrangement must meet the condition of "additionality"; i.e., the counterpurchases by the third party have to be in addition to regular exports from Indonesia. The transference of counterpurchase obligations may be managed by a bank, but the primary responsibility for fu l f i l lment of the req- uisite countertrade rests w i th the contractor. When a firm acts to fu lf i ll a counterpurchase obligation, it must meet one of two requirements: (1) if it has not previously exported Indonesian products, its exports of acceptable products must fulfill the counterpurchase obligation not 4 Under th is scheme, exporters are classified as producer-exporters (firms that export at least 65 percent of the ir total production) or as exporter-producers (firms that export 85 percent of the ir production and producers of tex t i les in general). Producer-exporters may bring into the coun t ry the ir imports free of licensing restrictions and import du t ie s, but w i th ex post documentation. If exporter-producers can demonstrate that the ir ou tput was, or w i ll be, exported or the ir ou tput was an input in an exported ou tpu t, then they can also receive the same permission to import their inpu ts as producer-exporters. The scheme also allows indirect exporters to reclaim import du t ies through a du ty drawback f a c i l i ty. 5 Projects or parts thereof financed w i th concessional loans as well as w i th credits from the IBRD, the Asian Development Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank are exempted from such requ i remen ts, as is the procurement of sophisticated technology and professional services and procurements invo lv ing jo int ven tu res between state enterprises and foreign investors. 6 Contract value for th is purpose is defined as being net of what the contractor spends on Indonesian supplies, taxes, du t ies, and wages paid w i th in the coun t ry. INDONESIA later than three months prior to the termination period of the contract; or (2) if the firm has exported Indonesian goods during the preceding year, qualified exports during the current year must exceed those of the previous year by at least the value of the counterpurchase obligation. Failure to fu lf i ll counterpurchase obligations may result in a penalty of up to 50 percent of the counterpurchase shortfall. Final payment to the foreign supplier cannot be made until after the countertrade has been effected. Counterpurchase sanctions have yet to be imposed. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles These are not restricted or subject to control. Proceeds from invisibles need not be surrendered. Travelers may take out and bring in any amount in foreign bank notes but only Rp 50,000 in Indonesian notes and coin other than gold and silver commemorative coins (see section on Gold, below). Capital Foreign capital invested in Indonesia is governed pri- marily by the Foreign Capital Inves tment Law of Jan- uary 10, 1967, and subsequently amended by a number of Presidential Guidelines and Decrees. In principle, such inves tmen ts may be under taken only through a joint ven ture with an Indonesian partner. All investments in Indonesia require the approval of the President on the recommendation of the Inves tment Coordinating Board (BKPM). Enterprises that are wholly or largely operated in Indonesia as separate business un i ts must be incor- porated under Indonesian law and must have their do- micile in Indonesia. The operating permit for foreign investment is usually valid for a maximum of 30 years. The obligation of a foreign partner in a jo int ven ture enterprise to divest its shares to 51 percent majority Indonesian ownership within 10 years after the com- mencement of production has been extended to 15 years. For enterprises with investment of more than US$10 mil- lion, those located in one of the ten undesignated developed provinces, or those exporting more than 65 percent of their production, this 15-year requirement may be extended by another 5 years. A foreign joint venture enterprise located in a bonded zone and exporting 100 percent of its production is allowed to have national share participation of 5 percent. A foreign joint venture enterprise may be treated as a domestic enterprise if it is 51 percent-owned by Indonesian nation- als, or 45 percent-owned by Indonesian nationals with 20 percent being sold through the stock market. Investment incentives for foreign capital investment in existence prior to 1984 in the form of tax holidays, investment allowances, loss compensation, and exemp- tions from dividend taxes have been abolished. The incentives currently applied for foreign investments are: exemption from the capital stamp duty and from import duties on capital goods, raw materials, auxiliary goods, and spare parts; an annual depreciation allowance of 25 percent for fiscal purposes on virtually all machinery 267 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDONESIA and other productive capital goods; and deferral of certain taxes on imports of capital goods. All foreign enterprises (PMAs) are eligible to receive customs duty incentives for their imported raw materials needed for two years' production activity. Raw materials may be imported with no time limit. In addition, an enterprise exporting more than 65 percent of its production is free to hire foreign experts as needed to maintain its export commitments. Managers of regional offices of a foreign company are granted multiple exit and re-entry permits for six months and exempted from the Rp 250,000 departure tax. Investors are granted the right to make capital repatri- ation, to transfer profits (after settlement of taxes and financial obligations in Indonesia), and to make transfers relating to expenses connected with the employment of foreign nationals in Indonesia, and in respect of depre- ciation allowances. The law provides that no transfer permit shall be issued for capital repatriation as long as benef i ts from tax relief are being received; at presen t, however, foreign paymen ts do not require a transfer permit. There are no limitations on the remittance to Indonesia of capital in the form of foreign exchange or commodities. Both residents and nonresidents may hold foreign cur- rency deposits with foreign exchange banks. However, foreign exchange banks and nonbank financial ins t i tu t ions are subject to Bank Indonesia directives w i th respect to borrowing abroad, the acceptance of deposits from non- residents, and the issuance of certificates of deposit to nonresidents. A 15 percent reserve requ irement is appli- cable to the foreign currency liabilities of foreign exchange banks; no reserve requirements are applicable to the foreign borrowings of nonbank financial ins t i tu t ions or private companies. Certain borrowing abroad is subject to clearance by Bank Indonesia, and all foreign borrowing is subject to reporting to Bank Indonesia and the M in is t ry of Finance. The prior approval of the Minister of Finance is required before any public enterprise or public sector body may accept a loan from abroad. Indonesian citizens and residents of foreign na t iona l i ty may freely transfer, negotiate, import, and export secu- rities denominated in rupiah or in foreign currency. The exploration and development of petroleum re- sources are governed by the Petroleum Law of 1960. Gold Indonesia has issued two commemorative gold coins, which are legal tender. Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold and gold coins in Indonesia. Travelers may freely take out up to Rp 65,000 a person in Indonesian commemorative gold and silver coins issued in August 1970, and up to Rp 130,000 a person in gold and silver coins issued in October 1974; amounts in excess of these limits require the prior approval of Bank Indonesia. Gold may be imported free of license only by importers des- ignated by the Governmen t. Such imports require prior notification to the Ministry of Industry and are subject to an additional levy of Rp 25 per US$1. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments January 15. Import permits for certain textile products (92 items, excluding batik products) and certain manu- factured steel products (11 items) were granted. January 23. Importers of cotton were required to purchase domestically produced cotton at a specified ratio relative to imported cotton. In the case of a shortfall in domestic cotton production, imports would be authorized. December 24. The number of licensed import agents was reduced from 278 to 70; import procedures for 111 i tems, including 56 steel i tems, were simplified; tariff rates were reduced on 65 items and raised on 91 items; and specific import du t ies, ranging from Rp 1,300 to Rp 4,000 per kg ., were imposed on certain food products. Exports and Export Proceeds May 15. Exports of all kinds of wood and wooden products were made subject to inspection before ship- men t. In add i t ion, exports of sawn t imber and processed wood were allowed only by approved exporters. June 11. The surcharge on coffee exports was abolished. October 1. Indonesia's coffee exports became subject to a quota under the In terna t ional Coffee Agreement. Total access for Indonesia's coffee was set at 4.75 percent of the global quota. December 24. The requ irement that exporters hold an export license number (APE and APET) was abolished, except for those products subject to quotas under inter- national agreements, such as coffee, or subject to licensing restrictions, such as textiles and plywood. In addition, companies under the PMA scheme, which operate in selected produc t ive sectors, were authorized to export their own products as well as those of other companies w i th in the sector. These purchases may be made directly or through domestic trading companies. 268 ©International Monetary Fund.

Imports from Israel and South Africa are proh ib i ted. All imports require the prior approval of the procurement and distribution centers, except for goods imported by the M in is t ry of Defense and certain other m i l i tary goods. The import policy is re-examined period- ically at the end of each Iranian calendar year (com- menc ing March 21). New export-import regulations, ef- fec t ive for the next year, are published by the M in is try of Commerce. The regulations distinguish between "au- thor ized ," "unauthorized ," and "prohibited" goods. "Au tho r ized" goods are those whose imports and ex- ports, w i th due consideration for the regulations, are pe rm i t ted. "Unau thor ized" goods are those whose im- ports and exports are temporarily prohibited by the Gove rnment or are contingent on the fu lf i l lment of certain requ iremen ts (as explained in the relative tariff). "Pro- h ib i ted" goods apply to those whose transactions are forb idden by Islamic Sharia or by the law. At the t ime of registration of imports, a registration fee of 5 percent of the value of the order, calculated on a c .i .f. basis, is collected by authorized banks. At the time of registration of some goods, importers must deposit w i th Bank Markazi, through an authorized bank, 15 percent of the c . i .f. value of the goods. Most food i tems and certain other commodities are exempt from the registration deposit. The registration deposit is refundable upon presentation of the customs clearance certificate after the goods have been cleared through customs, or if the order is canceled. If less than 90 percent of the registration value is used, the amount of refund of reg- is tra t ion fee will be in proportion to the unused amount of the registered order. Bank Markazi may permit, when necessary, the shifting of imports from the category in which a registration deposit is required to the exempt category, and vice versa. Most imports are subject to commercial benef it taxes, wh ich are e i ther specific or ad valorem and are imposed in add i t ion to any applicable customs du ty. Monopoly taxes, if any, are included in the commercial benef it taxes. The authorities specify in the export-import regulations the commercial benef it taxes for each year. These taxes are paid to customs before customs clearance. The clear- ance th rough customs is authorized upon presentation of shipping documen ts endorsed by an authorized bank and the permission of the relative procurement and distribu- tion cen ter (this permit may be issued at the time of opening of letters of credit and need not be reissued).

Foreign nationals working for the private sector or in organizations affiliated to or under government supervision in the Islamic Republic of Iran whose employment has been recognized as necessary by the Government may remit up to a maximum of 30 percent of their net salaries. Similar remittances by physicians can be from 15 percent to 60 percent, depending on the location and condition of their work. The transfer of the above-mentioned amount is contingent on a valid passport and work permit. Persons needing medical treatment abroad may obtain foreign exchange up to the amount specified by the High Medical Council of the Ministry of Health. The sale of foreign exchange to s tuden ts studying abroad varies according to the cost of living in the respective country up to a maximum of US$750 per mon th. An additional allowance of 45 percent and 15 percent of the basic allowance is provided, respec- tively, for the spouse and for each child. In certain cases where this allowance does not cover tu i t ion, university fees and expenses are separately calculated and paid. Foreign travelers entering the Islamic Republic of Iran must sell at least US$150 to US$300 (as specified by the Islamic Republic of Iran's representatives outside the country upon the issuance of entry permits) to the banking sys tem. Muslim citizens of other countries and citizens of countries which are party to bilateral agreements are exempt from this regulation. Travelers leaving the Islamic Republic of Iran may take out with them up to Rls 5,000 in Iranian bank notes. Travelers of foreign nationality may not export more foreign currency than they have imported. The import or export of any amount of foreign currency is allowed, provided that such amount was declared at the time of arrival. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of all commodities are subject to prevailing regulations on foreign trade. The commercial benefit tax and customs du ty charged at the time of import of raw materials used in manufactured goods for export are refunded to the exporter after the export has taken place. 270 Exporters of non-oil goods are allowed to import authorized goods up to the value of goods exported. Such exporters may transfer the declared foreign exchange earnings to another ind iv idual for import of goods. The foreign currency proceeds from commodity exports are sold to banks authorized to deal in foreign exchange. Authorized banks accept export proceeds normally in currencies quoted by Bank Markazi. With the prior approval of Bank Markazi, other currencies may also be accepted. Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from the export of invisibles may be retained in a foreign currency account with an authorized bank. Transfers from such accounts do not require the prior approval of Bank Markazi. Travelers may bring into the country up to Rls 20,000 in Iranian bank notes. Capital Iranian nationals may retain their foreign exchange earnings, if earned abroad, in domestic foreign currency accounts with domestic authorized banks. Transfers abroad from such accounts do not require the approval of Bank Markazi. Foreign capital inves tment is supervised by the Organization for Inves tment and Economic and Technical Assistance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance. Repatriation of foreign capital can be made with the approval of the said organization and Bank Markazi. The net short-term foreign liabilities of the commercial banks are subject to a reserve requirement of 27 percent. Gold No Iranian gold coin is legal tender. Residents may freely and w i thout license purchase, hold, and sell gold and silver in the domestic market. Authorized banks may import gold and silver bullion w i th the prior approval of Bank Markazi. The import and export of gold for monetary purposes or for international settlements is reserved for Bank Markazi. Imports for industrial and dental use are effected by professional organizations at the official rate and subject to supervision by Bank Markazi; such imports are subject to customs d u t y, the commercial benefit levy, and an import registration fee. Passengers may, without prior approval of Bank Markazi, bring in jewelry with a value equivalent to Rls 5 million, which will be recorded in their passports so that the same may be re-exported. Imports of personal jewelry w i th a value exceeding this amount require the approval of Bank Markazi. The export of Iranian gold coins for num isma t ic purposes requires prior approval by Bank Markazi.

Not for Redistribution IRAQ (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Iraq is the Iraqi Dinar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at ID 1 = US$3.2169. The official buying and selling rates on De- cember 31, 1987 were US$3.2249 and US$3.2088, re- spectively, per ID 1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are also officially quoted, with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. The Central Bank of Iraq undertakes transactions in the listed currencies only with authorized dealers. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk in the official or the commercial banking sector. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Board of Administration of the Central Bank; this authority has been delegated to the Governor and his Deputy, who act on recommendations submitted by an Advisory Commit- tee on Foreign Exchange. Certain approval authority has been delegated to the Department of Foreign Exchange and Banking Supervision of the Central Bank and to licensed dealers. Foreign exchange transactions must take place through a licensed dealer unless otherwise autho- rized by the Governor. Branches of the Rafidain Bank, the sole commercial bank, are licensed dealers. Import policy and the annual program are formulated by the Ministry of Trade. Prescription of Currency Settlements with foreign countries normally must be made in any of the listed currencies or by drawing on a nonresident account in Iraqi dinars, provided that the funds on the nonresident account were obtained originally through credits in any one of the listed currencies. Payments to and receipts from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The opening of a nonresident account requires the approval of the exchange control authorities. Nonresident accounts are divided into ordinary nonresident accounts, which arise from transactions in respect of current pay- ments, and special nonresident accounts, which arise from transactions in respect of capital transfers. Imports and Import Payments Imports of commodities normally are handled by the socialized sector. All private imports are subject to 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. licenses, except imports of materials constituting basic elements for development projects benefiting from the Law for Major Development Projects, No. 157 of 1973 (in respect of old contracts) or from the Law for Major Development Projects, No. 60 of 1985 (for new projects). Under Resolution No. 767 of October 1, 1987, foreign companies implementing development projects in Iraq are exempted from all import duties and domestic taxes accruing from the implementation of these projects, in- cluding income taxes due on earnings of their non-Iraqi workers. These exemptions apply to new projects that are contracted after the effective date of Resolution No. 767. The Law for Major Development Projects, No. 60 of 1985, ceased to be effective, except that its provisions continue to apply to projects that were contracted before the coming into force of Resolution No. 767. In principle, licenses are issued in accordance with an annual import program. Imports of all goods from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Imports of some commodities on a protection list are, in principle, prohibited from all sources. To finance the Export Subsidy Fund, a tax of 0.5 percent is levied on imports of capital goods, and a tax of 0.75 percent is levied on imports of consumer goods. All imports subject to import duty are also subject to a customs surcharge according to the available list of classified goods. The Rafidain Bank makes exchange available upon presentation of the exchange control copy of the import license, except in some instances where reference has to be made to the Central Bank. Imports financed by foreign exchange obtained by nonresident Iraqis are given special import licenses. The value of such imports may be invested in various projects in the country on behalf of the nonresident; earnings from such investments are not transferable. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require permission. Ex- change is usually granted for educational and medical expenses abroad, freight on exports effected on a c. & f. basis, insurance premiums, royalties, etc. Exchange is not granted to merchants for the insurance abroad of their imports or exports. The Rafidain Bank is permitted, subject to the approval of the Central Bank, to transfer up to 50 percent of annual income accrued to Arab and foreign nationals resident in Iraq, unless the particular contract extends this limit up to 75 percent for old contracts or 60 percent for new contracts. Certain non- resident private sector workers who have contracts with public institutions in Iraq are permitted to transfer the amounts provided for in those contracts; those not em- ployed under contracts may transfer abroad a monthly amount of ID 25 a person, with noncontractual workers employed by the Government being entitled to ID 58 per 271 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRAQ person per month, or up to 60 percent of earnings. Persons under 16 years and over 55 years of age, however, are not allowed to transfer abroad their earnings. The regulations provide, in principle, for basic exchange allowance for tourist travel abroad on the basis of clas- sification of foreign countries into two categories as follows. The basic allowance for travel to a country in the first category is ID 300 a trip for each person 18 years of age or over (ID 150 for persons under 18 years of age) for each trip to Arab and socialist countries, Turkey, Cyprus, and Greece. For the second category, which includes all other countries, the basic allowance is ID 500 a trip for each person 18 years of age or over (ID 250 for persons under 18 years of age). Individual exchange allowance for official missions abroad for first category countries ranges between ID 30-60 a person a day depending on status and duration of missions; for second category countries, the allowance ranges between ID 40- 75 per day. Students abroad are allocated a fixed amount in Iraqi dinars to be transferred to the country of their residence, except for certain countries (such as India, socialist countries, and North Africa) where students are paid a fixed amount in U.S. dollars. Travelers may take out ID 5 in Iraqi currency notes, which is considered part of the basic travel allowance, and the balance of that allowance, in traveler's checks. Residents on pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia are permitted to transfer the equivalent of ID 250 allowance for personal expenses in addition to all other traveling expenses paid to the local travel agent. Half of this allowance is permitted for persons under 18 years. Exchange allowances for pilgrimage are unrelated to other traveling allowances during the year. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa and exports of certain goods to all other countries are prohibited. The Ministry of Trade has authority to prohibit the export of any commodity when supply falls short of domestic demand. The export of certain items is reserved for the General Establishment for Imports and Exports. All other exports are licensed freely. Exporters generally must undertake to repatriate their foreign exchange proceeds through the Rafidain Bank and to surrender them within two months after shipment. Financial supports under an export subsidy fund estab- lished in 1969 for the purpose of assisting non-oil exports range between 20-40 percent of the value of eligible exports. The scheme is intended to introduce Iraqi goods abroad, whether from the private or socialist sector, and to improve their competitive position. The financial sub- sidies are granted according to a classified list of goods and upon presentation of the necessary documents from the Ministry of Trade. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts in excess of ID 50 from invisibles must be surrendered within three months to a licensed dealer. Travelers may bring in foreign exchange, 272 including currency notes (other than Israeli currency), in unlimited amounts, provided that the funds are declared on an exchange control form; amounts not intended to be taken out of the country are exempt from declaration. Travelers may bring in ID 25 in Iraqi notes. Iraqi nationals are allowed to bring in convertible foreign currencies, deposit them with a licensed dealer, and use the funds to purchase goods from duty-free shops. Capital Nonresidents may import capital freely, except from Israel or South Africa, but they must deposit it with the Rafidain Bank; such deposits may be converted into local currency at the official rate, and repatriation to the country of origin is permitted. Under Resolution No. 1646 of the Revolutionary Command Council, enacted in November 1980, no foreign (defined as non-Arab) participation is allowed in the capital of private sector companies, but citizens of Arab states may participate with Iraqis in the capital of industrial projects and commercial companies. All transfers of capital abroad by residents, whether Iraqis or foreigners, require exchange control approval. Iraqi nationals, foreigners, and nonresidents may transfer for- eign exchange to Iraq and deposit them with a licensed dealer in accounts bearing interest rates comparable to the international rates. Balances on these accounts with interest are freely transferable abroad in foreign curren- cies, provided that the funds were deposited with licensed dealers within three months of transfer. Iraqi nationals resident abroad (or their legal representatives) may with- draw from their nonresident accounts up to ID 10,000 a year in three installments to cover personal expenses inside the country. Under the Industrial Investment Regulation Law for private and mixed sectors (No. 115 of 1982), certain incentives and guarantees are granted to approved in- vestments of domestic or Arab capital in Iraq. In addition, Arab capital invested in Iraq is accorded preferential treatment in different economic sectors. Arab farmers having contracts with the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform are permitted to transfer abroad annually up to 50 percent of their individual net return, subject to a limit of ID 500. Under Resolution No. 431 dated June 17, 1987, an Arab investor is allowed to transfer capital to Iraq in a convertible currency through a licensed dealer or bring in new real assets related to the project he undertakes to establish in Iraq. He is eligible to obtain approval for import licenses without foreign exchange cover to import machinery, equipment, spare parts, fur- niture, and other requirements for the project. Import values of these items will be counted as part of the paid capital. Gold Under Resolution No. 801 dated October 10, 1987, an Iraqi resident, nonresident, or a foreigner may bring in, free of customs du ty, worked and unworked gold to Iraq, regardless of its weight, provided that it is declared upon importation. Iraqi residents may take out with them ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution worked gold not exceeding 100 grams a person, subject to declaration; such gold may be brought back on return to the country. Nonresident Iraqis are allowed to take out with them worked gold that they have already brought with them for personal use when they entered Iraq. Export and import of gold for commercial purposes are not permitted. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments May 11. Private sector importers were allowed to import raw materials and capital equipment and machinery di- rectly from suppliers of their choice, provided that pay- men ts would be made from their foreign exchange holdings abroad. IRAQ Capital June 17. Arab investors were allowed to transfer capital to Iraq in a convertible currency through licensed dealers or to bring in new real assets related to the project they undertake to establish in Iraq. They would be eligible to obtain approval for import licenses without foreign ex- change cover to import machinery, equipment, spare parts, furn i ture, and other requirements for the project, and import values of these items would be counted as part of the paid capital (Resolution No. 431). Gold October 10. Iraqi residents, nonresidents, and foreign- ers were allowed to bring in, free of customs du ty, worked and unworked gold to Iraq, regardless of its weight, provided that it is declared upon importation. 273 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRELAND (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Ireland is the Irish Pound. Ireland participates with Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Neth- erlands in the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, Ireland maintains the spot exchange rates between the Irish pound and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in European Currency Units (ECUs). The agreement implies that the Central Bank of Ireland stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. On December 31, 1987 these rates were as follows: Irish Pounds Upper limit Lower limit Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 1.8510 1.7695 100 Danish kroner 10.0087 9.5683 38.1825 36.4964 100 deutsche mark 100 French francs 11.3830 10.8825 100 Italian lire 0.0549952 0.0487799 100 Netherlands guilders 33.8868 32.3939 The participants in the EMS do not maintain exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. On Decem- ber 31, 1987 the official midpoint closing rate for the U.S. dollar was US$1.6755 per Ir£ l. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Access to the forward exchange market is regulated. Forward cover is permitted for the import and export goods and services, and forward contracts must corre- spond in all aspects to the underlying commercial trans- actions. The minimum and maximum maturity periods for which forward exchange transactions are permitted are 21 days and 12 months, respectively, except in the case of forward purchases of foreign exchange by banks, when up to 2 years is permitted. The Central Bank intervenes in the forward market intermittently. These interventions are primarily intended to influence banks' liquidity positions and not the forward exchange rate. On February 15, 1961 Ireland formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Exchange control is operated by the Central Bank. Much of the authority for approving normal payments is delegated to commercial banks authorized for this purpose (Authorized Dealers). Import licenses, where necessary, are issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce 274 if the goods are of an industrial nature, or by the Department of Agriculture and Food if they are agricul- tural in character; import licenses are also issued by the Department of Tourism, Fisheries, and Forestry, and in some cases by the Department of Health or the Depart- ment of Justice. Import licensing is not used for exchange control purposes. Import and export controls are admin- istered by the Revenue Commissioners. Prescription of Currency The administration of Irish exchange control is based on the distinction between entities that are permanently resident in Ireland and nonresidents —that is, residents of other countries. The latter comprise two categories: (1) residents of European Communities (EC) member countries, and (2) residents of all other countries. Au- thorized paymen ts may be made in Irish pounds or in any foreign currency. The proceeds of exports must be received in foreign currency or in Irish pounds from an External Account. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in Irish pounds of nonresidents are designated External Accounts. All credits in excess of Ir£250,000 to External Accounts held by nonbanks with authorized banks require specific approval by the Central Bank, except where the credit is in respect of imports of goods or services into Ireland. There are also limits on maximum balances in External Accounts of nonresident banks; balances in excess of Ir£250,000 may not be maintained without prior approval of the Central Bank. External Accounts may be credited w i th payments that are eligible for transfer abroad under a general or specific exchange control approval, w i th transfers from other External Accounts, paymen ts for any foreign currencies purchased from account holders, the proceeds of Irish currency notes received from abroad in denominations not exceeding Ir£20, paymen ts from within the country up to Ir£100* in value, and interest payable on the accounts; they may be debited for transfers to residents, transfers to other External Accounts, the cost of any foreign currency sold to account holders, the transfer of any part of account balances to account holders, and bank charges, if applicable. Authorized banks may operate foreign currency ac- counts in the names of nonresidents in any foreign currency; these accounts are generally subject to the same requ iremen ts as External Accounts. Credits in excess of Ir£250,000 are subject to prior approval. Au- thorized banks may also operate foreign currency ac- counts in the names of residents under specific Central Bank approval. 1 Effec t ive Janua ry 1, 1988, the l im it was increased to Ir£250. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Imports and Import Payments Imports of certain goods ( inc lud ing tex t i les, steel, footwear, tires, ceramic products, cooper tubes, and electronic goods) originating in certain non-EC countries are subject to either quantitative restrictions or surveil- lance measures. Imports from non-EC countries of products covered by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EC may be subject to various charges, such as levies and monetary compensatory amoun ts under that policy and to du t ies under the common customs tariff. For reasons of national policy, imports of certain goods (e.g., specified drugs, explosives, and firearms and am- mun i t ion) are prohibited w i thout special licenses. Prior permission of the Central Bank is required to pay for goods not being imported into Ireland or which are to be delivered more than nine months after the date of the order, or if payment is not being made in an approved manner. Goods not for use in Ireland mus t, in general, be paid for with borrowed foreign currency. For permitted imports, permission to make paymen ts to nonresidents is granted automatically. Au tho r i ty to make paymen ts is delegated to authorized dealers. Exchange control forms are required for import paymen ts exceeding Ir£50,000 (as from January 1, 1988). Payments for Invisibles Paymen ts to nonres iden ts require approval. Approval to make paymen ts for most invisibles is delegated to the authorized banks; for other invisibles, it is given by the Central Bank. For tourist travel there is a basic allowance in foreign currency for residents of Ireland of Ir£5002 a person for each trip, or when the trip exceeds two mon ths, Ir£2,0003. For business travel, up to Ir£3,0004 at a rate of Ir£1005 a day is allowed for each jou rney. Limits are also established for allowances for education and other purposes. Appli- cations for larger amounts are approved, provided that no unauthorized export of capital is involved. Not more than Ir£5006 of an allowance of foreign currency may be issued in the form of currency notes. Residents may also take with them up to Ir£1007 in Irish currency notes. Nonresidents may take with them any foreign currency notes that they brought into Ireland. Exports and Export Proceeds A system of export licensing is applied to a limited range of goods. Exporters of goods must obtain payment for the goods within six mon ths of shipment, if their value exceeds Ir£1008. When payment is received in foreign currencies, the exchange must be offered for sale to an authorized bank.

Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be repatriated w i thout delay, and if foreign currencies are received they must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer, or permission for their retention must be obtained. Any foreign currency held by a person after his return from a trip abroad may be retained for subsequent travel purposes for three months from the date of return. There are no limitations on the import of Irish or foreign bank notes, but prior Central Bank approval must be obtained to credit Irish bank notes in denominations exceeding Ir£20 to External Accounts. Capital Exchange control approval is required for all transfers of capital to nonresidents. Authority to make certain paymen ts has been delegated to authorized dealers; other payments require Central Bank approval. There are no restrictions on asset transfers for Irish residents taking up permanent residence abroad (effective January 1, 1988). The inflow of capital is not restricted, but inward direct inves tment requires exchange control approval. Pur- chases of unquoted Irish securities by nonresidents re- quire exchange control approval, and the purchase of nonurban land by foreign nationals in some cases requires approval by the Land Commission. Incoming capital received in foreign currencies must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer. The Central Bank approves applications by Irish resi- den ts for permission to purchase property for personal use in a member country of the EC with foreign currency purchased from Irish pounds. The acquisition of personal property located outside the EC is permitted, subject to a limit of Ir£20,00010 a property and one property for each family un i t. As from January 1, 1988, up to 25 percent of the cost may be met by purchasing foreign exchange with Irish pounds, and the remainder must be loans in foreign currency. Borrowings may be repaid with foreign ex- change in equal annual installments over a period of not less than five years. The entire foreign currency proceeds from the sale of property outside Ireland purchased for personal use of a resident must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer when they are not intended to be invested in another property or repay borrowing. The forward currency transactions of commercial banks are subject to limits, which vary from bank to bank, depending on the institution's level of participation in the foreign exchange market. Transactions in foreign currency securities are con- trolled to limit the amount of capital transferred outside Ireland. All such transactions must be routed through an approved agent (an Irish bank, stockbroker, or solicitor). 9 E f fec t ive January 1, 1988, the l im it was increased to Ir£50,000. 10 Effective January 1, 1988, the limit was increased to Ir£50,000. 275 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRELAND Resident holdings of all foreign currency securities may be sold only to nonresidents. Where such securities are sold, the proceeds must either be reinvested in foreign securities or be offered for sale to an authorized dealer within three months. During that three-month period, in the absence of the specific approval of the Central Bank, the proceeds must be held under the control of an approved agent. Purchases of foreign currency securities, apart from switches referred to above and purchases financed with foreign currency borrowing, were prohibited through 1987. In 1988 individuals will be allowed to invest up to Ir£5,000 in foreign securities. The Central Bank may also approve applications by authorized insurers, pension fund s, and registered unit trusts for the export of up to 12.5 percent (effective January 1, 1988) of their previous year's net Irish pound cash flow at the current rate of exchange for investment in foreign currency securities. Foreign currency borrowing by institutional investors, professional portfolio managers, and registered unit trusts for portfolio investment abroad is also approved. The Central Bank will grant permission for inves tment at the current rate of exchange in securities issued by the EC, the European Investment Bank, the European Coal and Steel Community (ESCC), and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). Such permission is granted only on an undertaking by the intending buyer that the securities will not be resold for at least one year from the date of purchase authorization, a requirement that applies also to purchases made from the sale or maturity proceeds of existing holdings. In line with this requirement, all sales of existing holdings of EC securities are subject to exchange control approval. Direct investment abroad requires prior approval. As from January 1, 1988, up to 25 percent of the cost of approved outward investments in non-EC countries may be financed by conversion from Irish pounds and the balance, through foreign borrowing. Use of Irish pounds is allowed, however, for all approved new direct invest- ments by Irish residents in EC member countries. Purchases by nonresidents of Irish registered securities must be funded with foreign currency or Irish pounds from an External Account; purchases in excess of Ir£100,000 require notification to the Central Bank. Remittances of cash gifts or personal loans are normally permitted up to Ir£l,500n a donor a calendar year. Applications by Irish residents to make cash gifts to EC residents, in excess of the normal allowance, are approved. As from January 1, 1988, foreign currency may be borrowed by residents for any purpose, subject to the approval of the Central Bank. Lending of Irish currency to nonresidents is not normally permitted, except to the extent that the nonresidents are parties to commercial transactions with residents. Overdraft facilities may be provided by the banks to members of diplomatic and consular missions in Ireland. Provided that the company is not a channel for portfolio inves tmen t, a subsidiary or 11 Effective January 1, 1988, the limit was increased to Ir£3,000. 276 branch of a company controlled directly by interests in EC countries may obtain from Irish banks, subject to exchange control approval, all the finance it requires for its operation in Ireland. Gold Residents may freely hold, buy, borrow, sell, or lend gold coin in Ireland. Dealings in gold bullion are restricted, and no dealings take place in Ireland. In accordance with a regulation of the EC Council dated October 27, 1986, Ireland does not permit the importation of gold coins from the Republic of South Africa. Although there are no other import restrictions, residents require specific exchange control permission to purchase gold coin or bullion outside Ireland. Specific exchange control per- mission is also required for the export of gold coin and bullion outside Ireland. Specific permission to buy or export gold coin or bullion normally is given only for bona fide numismatic or industrial purposes, respectively. Residents of Ireland are not permitted to hold gold abroad. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 12. The central rate for the Irish pound against the ECU was adjusted from Ir£0.764976 per ECU to Ir£0.768411 per ECU. The intervention rates against the deutsche mark were set at Ir£38.1825 per DM 100 (upper limit) and Ir£36.4964 per DM 100 (lower limit).

IRELAND 277 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ISRAEL (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement Resident Accounts in Foreign Currency The currency of Israel is the New Sheqel (plural, Sheqalim). The authorities do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions but intervene when necessary to smooth out fluctuations in rates and to maintain orderly conditions in the market. With effect from August 1, 1986, the new sheqel has been linked to a basket consisting of the following five major currencies: the U.S. dollar, the deutsche mark, the pound sterling, the French franc, and the Japanese yen. On Decem- ber 31, 1987 the noon midpoint exchange rate of the new sheqel in terms of the U.S. dollar was NIS 1.5386 = US$1. Authorized banks are permitted to deal in foreign exchange, and a levy of 1 percent of the transaction value is imposed on purchases of foreign exchange by the public, including those involving foreign currency- denominated PAT AM accounts (see below). An exchange rate insurance scheme covering export receipts is in operation (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, below). Forward exchange transactions are permitted, provided that they are intended to cover exchange rate risk arising from authorized trade and capital transactions and are conducted through the authorized dealers. Purchases and sales of currency options issued by the authorized dealers are permitted. Administration of Control Exchange control is the responsibility of the Controller of Foreign Exchange and is administered by the Bank of Israel, in cooperation with other government agencies, and is carried out through authorized banks. Prescription of Currency Payments and receipts must be effected in the currency and manner prescribed by the exchange control authorities. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents' funds are held either in foreign currency accounts or in local currency accounts. The opening of nonresident foreign currency accounts does not require prior approval. The holder may freely effect transfers from his foreign currency account. He may also convert funds held on the account into local currency at the market rate of exchange. There are no restrictions on the opening by a nonres- ident of a local currency account; such funds may be used locally in permitted transactions, including transfers between nonresidents. The sales proceeds of real estate and other investments may be transferred abroad in their entirety if the original investment was made through an authorized dealer with foreign currency or State of Israel Development Loan bonds. 278 Residents may maintain foreign currency deposits with authorized banks in Israel in either nonresident deposit accounts, which may, subject to conditions, be held by exporters and recent immigrants to Israel, or PATAM- Restitution accounts, which may be held only by recipi- ents of restitution payments and certain disability pensions. In addition, residents may maintain PATAM accounts that are time or deposit accounts denominated in foreign currency; the m in imum term for interest-bearing PATAM time deposits is one year. Banks are required to redeposit 100 percent of PATAM demand and time deposits with the Bank of Israel. However, no new deposits in foreign currency-denominated sheqalim can be made on PATAM accounts with a maturity of less than one year; but existing deposits in these accounts continue to be con- vertible into sheqalim at any time. PATAM-Restitution accounts are also demand or time deposit accounts in convertible currencies with authorized banks, which must redeposit all of these foreign currency funds with the Bank of Israel. Funds deposited in resti- tution accounts are free of taxation. PATAM-Restitution accounts are permitted to be used up to a limit of US$1,800 as additional travel exchange allocation. Holders of PATAM-Restitution accounts may resell securities bought with funds in such accounts for foreign currency and may deposit the proceeds in a PATAM-Restitution account. Residents who are not holders of PATAM-Restitution accounts may deposit the foreign exchange proceeds from the sale of foreign securities in PATAM accounts with a maturity of 12 months. Imports and Import Payments A few imports are prohibited from all sources. Imports of iron and steel products from South Africa are prohibited (imports effected under contracts entered into before September 17, 1987 are, however, permitted). With some exceptions, imports are free of licensing and administra- tive or quantitative restrictions. Some imports on a Restricted List are subject to approval; this list includes coffee, specified items of machinery, certain types of meat, fish, and dairy products, sugar, certain textiles, explosives and inflammables, tobacco, and nonalcoholic beverages. The import of soybeans has been liberalized and any food processing plant can import them directly. Foreign exchange to pay for authorized imports is granted automatically by the banks upon presentation of relevant documents (import documents, bills of lading, and letters of credit). Foreign exchange is also provided automatically for repayment of suppliers' credits. A value-added tax of 15 percent is levied on almost all imported and domesti- cally produced goods and services, other than capital goods, fresh fru i ts and vegetables, most foreign tourists' services, and travel tickets. A 2 percent additional duty ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution is levied on imports of goods subject to the value-added tax. Specified imports of 50 commodities considered as luxury items are subject to a one-year, non-interest- bearing deposit requirement of 3 percent of the value of imports, inclusive of customs du ty, purchase tax, and other charges (with the exception of the value-added tax).1 Payments for Invisibles Foreign exchange for payments abroad on account of invisibles is provided automatically upon proof of the nature of the transaction. The exchange allowance for tourist travel is the equivalent of US$2,000 a person for each journey, regardless of age. The business travel allowance is US$150 a day, up to a maximum of US$3,000 a trip (in addition to the standard allowance of US$2,000), which can be taken out in the form of cash, traveler's checks, credit card charges, or other foreign exchange instruments. Foreign exchange use by means of credit cards is included in the travel allowance. Resident trav- elers may take out Israeli bank notes not exceeding the equivalent of US$50 a person a trip. Israeli residents over 2 years of age traveling abroad are subject to a travel tax of NIS 250 on departure. (One half of the standard rate remains in effect for travel to Romania, and travel to Egypt remains exempt from tax.) Payments for hotel accommodation, land transport, and other related services under foreign package tours, along with other imports of services, are subject to the value-added tax of 15 percent. Residents may make family support and gift remittances abroad up to US$1,000 a year. The maximum exchange allowance for students studying at institutions of higher education abroad is US$500 a month. Nonresident travelers leaving Israel are permitted to take out Israeli bank notes up to the equivalent of US$100, and to repurchase through an authorized dealer, at the port of departure, foreign currency up to the equivalent of US$100. The right of a tourist to buy foreign currency, on presentation of documents showing previous conver- sion of foreign currency into Israeli currency, is limited during a visit to US$5,000, for a person over 18 years of age and to US$2,000, for a person under 18 years. Commercial banks are authorized to sell abroad unlimited amounts of Israeli currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports do not require licenses, although for some commodities export licensing is retained for quality con- trol. Exports of oil and defense equipment (and signing of defense contracts) to South Africa are prohibited. Export proceeds, which may be received in foreign currencies only, must be surrendered or held in a PATAM account. Exporters may retain in a bank deposit abroad or in a special exporter account in Israel an amount equivalent to 10 percent of their turnover in the preceding year. For inputs directly imported by an exporter, there 1 This requirement was eliminated on January 1, 1988. ISRAEL is a system of rebates of customs duties, wharf charges, and other related charges. The Israel Foreign Trade Risks Insurance Company (FTIC) provides an export insurance facility to cover unfavorable movements in domestic currency costs as measured by movements in the weighted average rate of the new sheqel against five major currencies —namely, the U.S. dollar, the pound sterling, the Netherlands guilder, the French franc, and the deutsche mark. The scheme covers exporters' value added. In return for a premium based on the value added of his exports, an exporter receives cover against any real appreciation of the new sheqel in relation to an export-weighted basket of the currencies of Israel's five major trading partners mentioned above. The premium rate is established on the basis of average expected inflation in the partner countries and the relationships among the forward exchange rates of the currencies constituting the basket. Exporters would receive payments from the FTIC if the real depreciation was less than expected, whereas they would make pay- ments to the FTIC if it was greater. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange proceeds from invisibles must, in general, be surrendered to an authorized dealer, or kept in foreign exchange in PATAM accounts. Any resident is free to accept specified convertible currencies from tourists in payment for customary tourist services and commodities other than commercial exports, securities, and real estate. For 20 years after entering Israel, new immigrants are exempt from the requirement to surrender their foreign exchange to authorized dealers, and they may hold these foreign currencies freely with authorized banks in Israel or with banks abroad.2 There are no limits on the amounts of Israeli bank notes or foreign currency that may be brought in by travelers. Capital Subject to approval, foreign exchange brought into Israel for the purpose of investment in the form of loan and equity capital may be granted preferential treatment in accordance with the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investment, which grants a limited withholding tax of 25 percent on income resulting from these invest- ments. Approvals granted under the law are classified as "approved enterprises," "approved investments," or "approved loans." Approved enterprise status is granted to enterprises (1) in the selected fields of industry, tourism, and agriculture (a separate law applies to agriculture); (2) established in priority areas; or (3) export oriented or in the field of import substitution in some specific lines of production. Approved investment or approved loan status may be granted to any enterprise in the above-mentioned sectors; however, loans may only be shareholders' loans. The period of the loan must not be less than seven years, and the rate of interest must not be more than 8 percent a year. 2 With effect from February 2, 1988, this time limit was extended to 30 years. 279 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ISRAEL Certain restrictions apply to borrowing in foreign cur- rency by residents. A freeze is in effect on all such direct foreign borrowing by nonbank residents, other than sup- pliers' credits and loans with average maturity of at least 30 months. The annual rate of interest on loans obtained abroad may not exceed LIBOR plus 1.5 percent. Foreign exchange loans are subject to a 3 percent levy; loans with an average maturity period of at least 39 months and suppliers' credits with a maturity period of up to 90 days are exempt from the levy. Proceeds accruing from the repatriation or liquidation of foreign assets are treated in the same way as other proceeds in foreign currency. Residents are not normally permitted to retain abroad real estate, money, securities, or the income from these assets. Residents may not buy foreign securities abroad, with the exception of specified types of Israeli firms' securities issued abroad with the approval of the Controller of Foreign Exchange. Resident exporters and airline and shipping companies may main- tain foreign bank accounts. New immigrants may retain their foreign assets for 20 years.3 Transfers abroad of a capital nature by residents other than new immigrants require a special permit from the Controller of Foreign Exchange. Emigrants are permitted to transfer their Israeli assets abroad up to the equivalent of US$2,000 per year. Nonresidents are permitted to purchase in Israel real estate and shares. In order to repatriate the principal or profits on these investments, proof is required by an authorized dealer that they were purchased with foreign currency through an authorized dealer. Direct loans in any form from Israeli residents to nonresidents are subject to licensing. Investments abroad by Israeli residents are subject to a tax of 15 percent. Gold Gold bullion for industry may be imported by an importer holding an import license. Gold bullion and coins for investment, or certificates conferring a right to gold bullion, must be held in a gold custody account with an authorized dealer; beginning from January 1, 1984, resi- dents have not been permitted to buy gold bullion or coins for investment purposes. The following bullion coins are at present included in the list of gold coins for investment: (1) Krugerrand of South Africa; (2) 50 dollar Maple Leafs of Canada; (3) 50 pesos of Mexico; (4) 100 corona and 4 dukat coins of Austria; (5) sovereigns of Great Britain; (6) 10 dollar and 20 dollar Liberty coins of the United States; and (7) 20 franc napoleon coins of France.

The import deposit requirement on luxury goods was reduced from 15 percent to 12 percent, and a schedule was announced for fur ther quarterly cuts of 3 percent to be effected until the abolition of the scheme by January 1, 1988. January 1. The customs duties on about 40 percent of imports from the European Communities (EC) were reduced by 60 percent, lowering their level of 50 percent on July 1977 when the agreement between Israel and the EC was signed, to 20 percent. The remaining duties would be eliminated by January 1989. January 1. The customs duties on products accounting for about 90 percent of imports from the United States were lowered in parallel with the reduction of import tariffs applicable to imports from the EC. All remaining customs duties on this group of products are expected to be abolished by January 1, 1989. The customs duties on a limited group of imports from the United States, consisting primarily of textiles, were lowered by a further 10 percent, bringing them to 70 percent of their September 1985 level when the agreement between Israel and the United States was signed. Further reductions of 10 percent per year were planned until their complete elimination by January 1995. September 17. Imports of iron and steel products and gold coins from South Africa were prohibited. Payments for Invisibles March 8. The foreign travel tax was set at NIS 250 a journey for persons over 2 years of age (one half of the standard rate remained in effect for travel to Romania, and travel to Egypt remained exempt). March 28. The 20 percent surcharge on airline and ship tickets for travel abroad purchased in Israel and the 15 percent surcharge on tourist ground services abroad prepaid through Israeli travel agents were abolished. April 23. The exchange allowance for tourist travel was raised to US$2,000 a person, regardless of age. The business travel allowance was raised to US$150 a day, up to a maximum of US$3,000 a trip.

Not for Redistribution ITALY (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Italy is the Italian Lira. Italy partici- pates with Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Re- public of Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Ne th- erlands in the exchange rate and in terven t ion mechan ism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, Italy ma in ta ins spot exchange rates between the Italian lira and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 6 percent above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in European Currency Un i ts (ECUs). The agreement implies that the Bank of Italy (the central bank) stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in un l im i ted amoun ts at specified intervention rates. The participants in the EMS do not maintain the exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper functioning of the system, they in tervene in concert to smooth out fluctuations in exchange rates, the in terven t ion currencies being each other's and the U.S. dollar. Official rates for 20 foreign currencies1 are quoted daily on the basis of market rates.2 On December 31, 1987 the rate for the U.S. dollar was Lit 1,169.25 per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The monetary authorities do no t, in principle, intervene in the forward exchange market; forward prem iums and discounts are normally left to the interplay of market forces. Authorized banks are allowed to engage in spot exchange transactions in any currency, and in forward exchange transactions up to 18 mon ths in major convert- ible and externally convertible currencies.3 Forward cover is freely permitted only for commercial transactions; cover in respect of financial transactions requires authorization. Residents are permitted to buy freely currency options from authorized banks for all transactions involving goods and services. Italy formally accepted the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Administration of Control The exchange control system is operated by the Italian Exchange Office (Ufficio Italiano del Cambi, or UIC). All sales and purchases of exchange must be effected through banks authorized for this purpose. Import and export licenses, when required, are issued by the Ministry 1 Currencies officially quoted are Australian dollars, Aus t r ian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, ECUs, Finnish markkaa, Greek drachmas, French francs, Irish pounds, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 2 The official rate is the average of the "fixing" quotations of the foreign exchange markets in Milan and Rome. 3 These currencies are referred to in the Italian regulations as the conto valutario currencies. of Finance at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Certain imports and exports require the prior visa of the National Foreign Trade Institute. Issues of secu- rities by nonresidents require the prior approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and are subject in addition to the rules governing the issuing of Italian securities in Italy. Payments to and from the Republic of San Marino or Vatican City are made in internal lire and therefore are not subject to exchange control. The net external position of the resident banks is subject to control by the UIC. This control encompasses (1) the net foreign position in foreign currencies and lire together; (2) the overall position, spot and forward combined, in all foreign currencies; and (3) outstanding net forward transactions against lire, which are subject to a ceiling set for each bank. The banks are prohibited from main- taining a net external creditor position. Prescription of Currency Settlements with foreign countries must normally be made in convertible currencies or in lire on Foreign Accounts. Nonresident Accounts The main types of accounts in Italian lire which non- residents are allowed to maintain with authorized banks are Foreign Accounts and Special Accounts.4 The use of these accounts is described below. Foreign Accounts may be credited with transfers from other Foreign Accounts, from Capital Accounts, and from Special Accounts Under Law No. 43, with lire from authorized current and capital payments, and with the proceeds from sales of convertible currencies. They may be debited for purchases of any of these currencies in the ordinary market, for transfers to any other Foreign Accoun t, Capital Account, or Special Account for pay- ments to residents of Italy for current and capital trans- actions, and for drawings in cash by the holder of the account or his nominee. Capital Accounts may be credited with transfers from Foreign Accounts, from Special Accounts, and from other Capital Accounts and with the proceeds from the liqui- dation of foreign investments in Italy not made under the provisions of Law No. 211 or Law No. 43 (see below). Capital Accounts may be debited for transfers to any other Capital Account or to Foreign Accounts and for 4 Italians living or working abroad as well as "border-area" residents are permitted to maintain w i th Italian banks Emigrants' Foreign Currency Accounts denominated in conto valutario currencies. They may be credited w i th remittances (including bank notes) sent directly to the bank from abroad (up to 80 percent of the holder's wage or salary earnings) and w i th interest on the balance; they may be debited freely for conversion into lire, for withdrawals in foreign bank notes, and for transfers abroad (except for accounts held by "border-area" residents). These accounts may also be held by Italian representatives abroad and by Italian staff employed by international organizations located in Italy. 281 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ITALY the purchase of investments, including purchases of personal property or real estate in Italy. Special Accounts Under Law No. 43 of February 7, 1956 are accounts in the names of nonresidents who have invested convertible currencies or externally convertible currencies in Italy in accordance with the above- mentioned law. These accounts may be credited with the countervalue of convertible currencies sold in Italy, with transfers from Foreign Accounts, or from other Special Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of investments that have been made in accordance with Law No. 43. They may be debited for purchases of currencies that were originally sold and for investments in Italy, and balances may be transferred to Foreign Accounts, Capital Accounts, or any other Special Account. Nonresidents may also maintain * 'foreign accounts in foreign exchange" to which may be credited foreign exchange receipts from abroad, transfers from other "foreign accounts in foreign exchange," payments from residents for authorized transactions and, in approved cases, receipts from the sale of assets. Imports and Import Payments Imports are governed by a Ministerial Decree of May 6, 1976, which has been replaced by the Decree of December 24, 1987 (No. 589), entering into effect on January 1, 1988. The import regulations vary with the country of origin. Countries are grouped in three major areas: Zone A, which is subdivided into subzones A/1 (European Communities (EC) countries, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, and Reunion), A/2 (overseas countries and territories, member countries of the Eu- ropean Free Trade Association (EFTA), and other coun- tries associated with the EC), and A/3 (third countries); Zone B, which comprises member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), Albania, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; and Zone C (Japan). The import control procedures distinguish between goods that may be freely imported without quantitative restrictions and goods that require a special license. Import liberalization is virtually complete for subzones A/1 and A/2, and very few quantitative restrictions remain for subzone A/3. Many types of goods from Zones B and C are heavily restricted. For imports from countries in Zone B, as well as Yugoslavia, the country of origin must also be the country of shipment. Imports from non-EC countries of most products cov- ered by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EC are subject to variable import levies that have replaced all previous barriers to imports. Common EC regulations are also applied to imports from non-EC countries of most other agricultural and livestock products. For imports not exceeding Lit 20 million in value, no exchange control form is required; for imports exceeding Lit 20 million in value, a form completed by the importer is required; for imports of some goods, an import docu- ment already completed by an authorized bank is required. Where settlement takes place more than 12 months after 282 importation, the importer must choose an authorized bank as his bank of domicile, through which he must carry out all payments operations. Deferred payments for imports from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries are permitted freely; deferred payments for imports from non-OECD countries are permitted if settlement is to take place within five years after importation. Advance payments for imports of goods and services are required to be financed with foreign borrowing.5 For all authorized imports, the authorized banks pro- vide exchange or permit payment in Italian lire to a Foreign Account, provided that appropriate payment terms are observed (see section on Capital, below). International postal money orders may be used for import payments, subject to a limit for each remitter and foreign beneficiary. A 15-day limit exists on balances held by residents in Foreign Exchange Accounts for foreign ex- change purchases to make payments abroad.6 Payments for Invisibles The authorized banks may sell foreign exchange for payments for invisibles, provided that the necessary documents are submitted. Their authority to sell exchange for remittances as grants and aid is limited to Lit 2.5 million a year, and approval of the UIC is required for transfers by immigrants in Italy for more than ten years if the amounts exceed certain limits or if the transfer is to a country other than the country of origin. Exchange is granted freely for remittances of earnings or invest- ments. Residents may use international postal money orders for authorized payments, up to a maximum amount of Lit 2 million. The provisions governing deferred pay- ments and the time limit on balances in Foreign Exchange Accounts also apply to payments for services. Certain transactions (but not the related payments) in respect of services are subject to approval by the Ministry of Foreign Trade. All contracts for insurance of ships and aircraft must be approved by the Ministry of Industry. There are no limits on expenditures for tourism. Res- idents traveling to foreign countries may obtain from the banks foreign exchange equivalent to SDR 1,250 a person a trip, and additional expenditures for tourism may be met by bank transfers or the use of credit cards. Author- ized banks may grant foreign exchange without limit for business, medical treatment, and education, provided they are satisfied that this is justified in view of the duration and purpose of the trip. The limit on the amount of Italian bank notes that can be taken out by residents is Lit 500,000 in any denomination for each visit abroad.7 Nonresidents can freely take out foreign exchange up to the equivalent of Lit 5 million without showing proof that foreign exchange has been brought into Italy. They can also take out Lit 500,000 in Italian bank notes of any 5 This requirement was abolished on January 20, 1988. 6 The limit was increased to 60 days on January 20, 1988. 7 Persons living in border areas may not take out more than Lit 50,000 a day in domestic bank notes and coin, and the equivalent of Lit 50,000 a day in foreign currency notes and coin. ©International Monetary Fund.

Importation of Italian bank notes from foreign banks is not restricted and effected by crediting the capital accounts at the Bank of Italy with the corre- sponding amounts. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to any country of a few commodities in a special list (Tabella Esporf) require export licenses. For exports not exceeding Lit 20 million in value, no exchange control form is required; for exports exceeding Lit 20 mil- lion in value, a form completed by the exporter is required; for exports of some goods, an export document already completed by an authorized bank is required. If settlement takes place more than 12 months before exportation, the exporter must effect the payments operations related to his export transactions through an authorized bank as his bank of domicile. For the settlement of exports, resident banks are allowed to grant credits denominated in lire to foreign banks for a maximum period of ten days. Advance payments for exports may be received freely if exportation is to take place within five years. Deferred payments for exports to non-OECD countries are per- mitted if settlement of at least 90 percent is to take place within 18 months after exportation and the balance within 24 months. Except in the case of exports to OECD countries on delayed payment terms of up to five years, settlements beyond 18 months from shipment are subject to approval by the Ministry of Foreign Trade for amounts exceeding Lit 5 billion or by the UIC for amounts up to Lit 5 billion. In all other cases such receipts require the prior approval either of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, or (for up to Lit 50 billion) of the Autonomous Agency for Export Credit Insurance (SACE), or of the Medi- ocredito if the payment term granted to the foreign importer is less than eight years, depending on whether the transaction will be covered by state insurance or financed at a preferential interest rate under Law No. 227/77. All export proceeds must be surrendered to authorized banks within 30 days of effective receipt. Proceeds in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, and externally convertible European currencies may be retained by authorized banks on behalf of the recipients in "Foreign Exchange Accounts" for up to 30 days, during which period such balances may be used for permitted transactions or sold to authorized banks;8 the banks are allowed to sell these currencies to residents for authorized transactions or to negotiate them freely with the UIC or among themselves. In cases where documentation is not in order at the time of surrender, proceeds may be posted to "Ordinary Waiting Accounts" for a period of up to 15 days from the date of surrender.9 If the necessary documents are not received until after the 15-day waiting period, the proceeds must be assigned to the UIC upon completion of the transaction and will be converted into lire at the lowest exchange rate quoted 8 The limit was increased to 120 days on January 20, 1988. 9 The limit was raised to 30 days, w i th effect from January 20, 1988.

Export proceeds may also be received by international postal money order, and in certain circumstances, in foreign bank notes that are accepted in the country of issue for credit to bank accounts, balances in which are convertible at official market rates. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from current invisibles are subject to the same collection, retention, and surrender requirements as re- ceipts from exports. Shipping and insurance companies and forwarding agencies may keep Operating Accounts (Conti Autorizzati) in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, and externally con- vertible European currencies; unutilized balances must be surrendered periodically. Residents may not retain foreign bank notes left over from trips abroad above the equivalent of Lit 200,000 but must sell them to an authorized bank. Persons may bring in any amount in foreign or domestic bank notes. For imports of more than Lit 500,000 in the case of residents and Lit 5 million in the case of nonresidents, however, the bearer may be asked to indicate the origin and/or the intended use of the bank notes. Capital Inward and outward movements of nonresident capital are free, but most loans from nonresidents to residents and from residents to nonresidents require specific au- thorization from the Ministry of the Treasury in agreement with the Ministry of Foreign Trade; long-term loans (other than loans from financial institutions to nonresidents) from member countries of the OECD for establishing or maintaining lasting economic relations, and loans to relatives up to the third degree of relationship, and some loans from certain German institutions to identified Italian residents do not require authorization. Italian residents are allowed to borrow abroad within the following limits: for maturities of less than one year, Lit 1 billion; for maturities of one year to eight years, Lit 5 billion from OECD residents, and Lit 1 billion from other countries' residents; for maturities of longer than eight years, Lit 0.5 billion. Loans connected with the acquisition of shares are liberalized, provided that the corresponding amorti- zation plan is not shorter than 36 months (as regards the average life of the loan). Repayment of loans may be made freely. Prior approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade is required for an Italian company to establish an overseas financial holding company; the parent company must, inter alia, submit annual audited accounts of such a holding company to the Ministry. Foreign investment in Italy is, in principle, governed by Law No. 43 and subsequent implementing regulations. Foreign investments of any kind, including both direct and portfolio investment and the purchase of real estate, are permitted freely, and no restrictions are applied to their repatriation. 283 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ITALY Direct investment in OECD countries by physical or juridical persons (other than participation by credit and insurance institutions in a foreign company not having the same corporate purpose) is permitted in any form and without any limit.10 Direct investment in other countries may be made only by juridical persons in firms that are in the same line of business as that of the Italian firm making the investment; other types of direct investment in such countries require special authorization from the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The general license to make these investments also covers the reinvestment of earnings and the use for this purpose of the liquidation proceeds of previous investments (after crediting the proceeds of the disinvestment to bank accounts similar to those established for proceeds from exports and invisibles; see section on Proceeds from Invisibles, above). Residents are free to buy and sell, through the Bank of Italy or the authorized banks, any foreign securities issued or payable abroad and quoted on foreign stock exchanges, and to deal in such securities among them- selves against payment in lire. Such foreign securities, except securities of Lit 1 million or less, have to be deposited with an Italian bank or with a bank abroad for an account of an Italian bank. The purchase by residents of shares of foreign mutual funds quoted in EC countries requires prior approval. A resident is able to purchase freely shares of foreign funds that have received author- ization from the Ministry of Foreign Trade to sell their shares in Italy, since that authorization is valid also for the individual resident subscriber. Such authorization is given only to funds meeting certain requirements, includ- ing the investment in Italian securities of funds raised in Italy. Residents do not require authorization to purchase real estate in EC countries. All issues of securities by nonresidents on the Italian capital market require the prior approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade after consultation with the Bank of Italy. Issues are normally restricted to international institutions. Transfers in connection with donations and inheritances may be made freely. The transfer of property of residents leaving Italy permanently is allowed in two stages: the equivalent of Lit 10 million a person is allowed upon presentation of specified documents to an authorized bank at the time of leaving Italy, and the remainder is subject to examination of the documents by the UIC, when residence has been established abroad. The maximum holding periods for funds credited to foreign exchange accounts are as follows: for foreign currency acquired directly from abroad and from optional export financing provided by authorized banks, 30 days; for foreign currency purchased against lira or originating in import financing, 15 days; for funds originating in the compulsory financing of exports (currently 75 percent), 10 Financial investment —that is, investment not intended to establish permanent relations —is not considered direct investment.

The monetary authorities may freely acquire unrefined gold abroad. Authorized banks may acquire unrefined gold abroad, under authorization of the Ministry of the Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Trade, to sell it to Italian firms authorized by the Ministry of Foreign Trade for industrial use. Exports of wrought and semimanufac- tured gold, other than jewelry, are subject to licensing. Imports of unref ined gold are not subject to value-added tax. Importation and exportation of gold coins that are legal tender in a foreign country are prohibited in the absence of a special authorization. Imports of other gold coins for numismatic purposes are free but subject to value-added tax at 18 percent. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments12 April 29.

Not for Redistribution JAMAICA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Jamaica is the Jamaica Dollar, for which the spot exchange rate in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is determined at an auction conducted twice a week by the Bank of Jamaica. Pur- chasers of foreign exchange in the auction pay their own bid price if their bids are successful, instead of the market- clearing price. Since November 1985, the selling rate for the U.S. dollar has been kept within narrow margins of J$5.50 = US$1 by official intervention in the auction. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were J$5.48 = US$1 and J$5.52 = US$1, respectively. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange, except that exporters of manufac- tured goods, excluding petroleum products and garments assembled from materials imported from the United States, to non-Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) countries are paid a rebate equal to ll/2 percent of f.o.b. export receipts. The Bank of Jamaica's dealings in Jamaica dollars are confined to transactions in specified curren- cies.1 For spot dealings with commercial banks in these currencies, the Bank of Jamaica charges no commission on purchases but 0.0625 percent on sales. For currencies of countries that are not members of CARICOM, the commercial banks apply a commission charge varying between 2 cents and 15 cents per unit of foreign currency on sales and purchases. For currencies of CARICOM members, the commercial banks apply a commission charge of 0.3361 percent on sales and a discount charge of 0.25 percent on purchases. The operation of forward market in foreign exchange operated by commercial banks is governed by the regu- lations issued in November 1984. Commercial banks are permitted to deal in forward exchange for maturities of between one and six months; the forward rates at which they are prepared to deal are published daily. The banks are permitted to purchase forward exchange representing proceeds from nontraditional exports other than those to be surrendered to the Export Development Fund and services other than tourism subject to an aggregate limit of US$30 million on the banks' net uncovered positions. Eligibility to buy forward exchange from the commercial banks is limited to applicants eligible to bid for foreign exchange at the spot auction. The commercial banks may secure and maintain foreign currency resources from their head offices or correspondent banks overseas to meet their uncovered or mismatched forward commitments. 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche ma rk, French francs, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Mexican pesos, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, Vene- zuelan bolivares, and the currencies of member countries of CAR ICOM. The CARICOM member countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. K i t ts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. V incent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 286 The Bank of Jamaica reserves the right to deal in the forward exchange market with the commercial banks only. Jamaica formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 22, 1963. Administration of Control The Bank of Jamaica administers exchange control on behalf of the Minister of Finance, subject to certain limitations in respect of which the approval of the Minister is required. The commercial banks are designated as authorized dealers and act as agents of the Bank of Jamaica in respect of trade and most service transactions. Since April 16,1985, import licenses have been required only for basic foodstuffs, motor vehicles, certain chemi- cals, fertilizers, pharmaceutical products, wood products, and items potentially harmful to public health or security. Import licenses, when required, are issued by the Trade Administrator, who is responsible to the Minister of Industry and Commerce. Prescription of Currency Payments to all countries may be made by crediting Jamaica dollars to an External Account or a foreign currency account.2 Receipts from all countries must be received by debit of an External Account or in any foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts The commercial banks are empowered to open External Accounts in Jamaica dollars for nonresidents, provided that no credit of Jamaica dollars is made to the accounts without the specific approval of the Bank of Jamaica. Funds on these accounts may be transferred freely be- tween nonresidents. External Accounts may be credited with payments by residents of Jamaica that have been approved by the Exchange Control Au thor i ty, with trans- fers from other External Accounts, and with the proceeds from the sale to an authorized dealer of gold or foreign currencies. They may be debited for payments to residents of Jamaica, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for the purchase of foreign currencies. Accounts that are credited with funds that may not be placed at the free disposal of nonresidents of Jamaica (including capital gains from the sale of undeveloped land and proceeds from the sale of emigrants' real estate and financial assets) are designated Blocked Accounts. Blocked funds may be used without limitation by nonresidents for local expenditure while they are in Jamaica, and for investment in Jamaica dollar securities, local mortgages, 2 All currencies other than the Jamaica dollar are considered foreign currencies. All foreign currencies have been designated as specified currencies. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution or other investments approved by the Bank of Jamaica. Applications for the release of funds in Blocked Accounts in excess of J$5,000 a calendar year, for use in Jamaica by the nonresident owner, must be referred to the Bank of Jamaica. Since April 1984, all payments from abroad to Jamaican hoteliers must be paid into a special account of the Bank of Jamaica, the Jamaican National Retained Account (JNRA). Hotels are allowed to obtain foreign exchange to satisfy their import requirements and service payments up to a limit of 20 percent of their lodgements. Net amounts due to hotels are reimbursed by the Bank of Jamaica in Jamaica dollars. Imports and Import Payments Imports from, or originating in, South Africa are pro- hibited. Import licenses are required for basic foodstuffs, motor vehicles, certain chemicals, fertilizers, pharmaceu- tical products, wood products, and items endangering public health or security. For some goods, licenses are not normally issued unless they originate in member countries of CARICOM. Certain food items and all motor vehicles may be imported only by a public sector agency, the Jamaica Commodity Trading Corporation. Otherwise, goods may be imported freely without license. Effective March 1984, payments for imports other than those cleared through customs before January 1984 were delegated to the commercial banks and may be made without reference to the Bank of Jamaica. Since December 1985, in order to secure funds from the foreign exchange auctions, commercial banks have been requested to sub- mit to the Bank of Jamaica on the day following the auction, the import clearance document together with the bid submitted to the auction. In respect of such imports, the importer must present to his commercial bank a copy of invoices or other evidence of purchase and value, including, since January 1986, certification of value from international agencies, together with documentary evi- dence that the goods have been cleared through customs. Exchange control approval is required for advance pay- ments in excess of US$2,000, but is generally granted. Importers may, in principle, buy foreign exchange forward for a period of one to six months prior to the date of shipment of goods, but in practice this facility is little utilized. Certain goods are subject to consumption duties, whether they are imported or manufactured domestically. Imports are subject to customs duties that comply with the Common External Tariff arrangement of CARICOM. A 10 percent stamp du ty tax is also applied to imports, with the exception of government imports, basic food items, crude petroleum, imports from CARICOM countries, and most raw materials. On April 13, 1985 an additional stamp duty was imposed, at rates of 10 percent for raw materials, 20 percent for capital goods, and 30 percent for consumer goods, with the same exemptions. The stamp duties are collected at the port of entry and are calculated on c.i.f. value of the goods, including duties. The application of the tariff structure is modified by exemptions allowed to JAMAICA specified importers under legislation designed to assist particular sectors. Payments for Invisibles Commercial banks are authorized to provide foreign exchange for most service transactions, including business and other travel, medical expenses, foreign exchange refund, cash gifts, pensions, and miscellaneous payments, such as registration and subscription fees. All other service payments require prior approval of the Bank of Jamaica. Foreign exchange is made available for remit- tance of income from emigrants' properties and for remittance for family maintenance, subject to a limit of US$1,000 a year for each category. Amounts exceeding these limits may be approved by the Minister of Finance on humanitarian grounds. In addition, a limit of US$50 a year is applied to cash gift remittances. All interest and dividends payable to nonresident investors are approved, net of taxes, without restriction, except for the repatriation of profits during the first three years under the debt-equity conversion program. A basic exchange allowance of US$150 a person for each calendar year for foreign travel, other than for business or professional purposes, is made available to residents by authorized dealers. The sale of foreign exchange for travel for business and professional purposes is subject to a maximum allowance of US$200 a day for a period not exceeding ten days. Non-Jamaicans working in Jamaica under a work permit are allowed to remit abroad 30 percent of their gross salary during the period of their contract and their accumulated assets at the end of the contract period. Residents going abroad may take with them Jamaica bank notes not exceeding J$20. Bona fide requests for additional amounts are approved by the Bank of Jamaica. Nonresidents may take out the foreign currency notes they brought in. Exports and Export Proceeds All goods may be exported to any country that is not on the prohibited list.3 However, specific licenses are required for the export of certain agricultural products, ammunition, explosives, firearms, antique furniture, ready- made garments, gold bullion, mineral and metal ores, and antique paintings. Exporters are required to surrender their exchange proceeds to authorized dealers within three months from the date of shipment. Exporters of specified nontraditional products are allowed to sell for- eign exchange earnings forward, subject to fulfillment of surrender requirements. Exporters of manufactured goods, excluding petroleum products and garments assembled from materials imported from the United States under 807 arrangements and to non-CARicoM countries, are paid a rebate equal to 7Vi percent of f.o.b. export values. 3 This list comprises Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, South Africa, and the U.S.S.R. Exports to these countries require specific licenses. In practice, no licenses are issued for exports to South Africa. 287 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JAMAICA Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in foreign currencies must be sold to an authorized dealer. Residents returning to Jamaica may bring in Jamaica bank notes up to J$20 a traveler. Resident travelers are required to sell their holdings of foreign currencies to an authorized dealer upon return. Tourists are required to convert their foreign currencies to settle their hotel bills in Jamaican currency. Capital Outflows of resident-owned capital are restricted, ir- respective of their destination. Investments abroad by residents require the approval of the exchange control authorities and are not approved unless they are expected to result in tangible benefits for Jamaica. The purchase of local assets by residents from nonresidents also requires the approval of the exchange control authorities, but this is normally granted. With the exception of certain types of inves tment in residential and commercial real estate, all approved direct investments in Jamaica by nonresidents are granted 4'ap- proved status," under which the investor is given written assurance that he will be able to remit all current pay- ments, including interest and dividends relating to the investments, and will at any time be able to repatriate his original investment plus any capital gain. In order to obtain approved status, the investor must apply to the Bank of Jamaica. Nonresidents are normally not permitted to take up security in respect of loans made to Jamaican companies owned or controlled by them. Domestic bank credit to nonresidents and to non-resident-controlled companies is subject to selective credit controls; for this purpose, firms are considered to be non-resident-controlled when the controlling interest is held beneficially, either directly or indirectly, by persons resident outside the CARICOM area. Such lending is subject to approval by the Bank of Jamaica. There is a fixed-term foreign currency deposit scheme for both residents and nonresidents. Accounts under this scheme may be credited with any means of paymen t, except cash or traveler's checks, but the transactions must be effected through a commercial bank; the deposits are freely repatriable upon ma tur i ty. In general, non-Jamaican nonresidents are not permit- ted to raise local mortgages. However, nonresidents working in Jamaica under a work permit may acquire a house to live in, with the permissible amount of mortgage restricted to 50 percent of the appraised value. Foreign nonresident owners of land in Jamaica, when selling to residents, are allowed to remit from Jamaica the amount they paid originally from funds brought into Jamaica. In the case of property not fully developed, the balance of the sale price can be remitted annually in five equal installments, commencing one year after the realization of the gain, subject to a m in imum remittance in any one year of the foreign currency equivalent of J$20,000, except 288 when the owner had previously received an undertaking that the inves tment in land carried approved status. If the property is fu l ly developed, the balance can be remitted over two years commencing one year after the realization of the gains. Foreign nonresident owners of houses built on residen- tial lots may remit in full the proceeds of sale, provided the un it is not sold w i th in two years of completion of the construction and the vendor has conformed to the Tax- ation and Exchange Control Acts. If the unit is sold within two years of completion, the investor may remit the original inves tment immediately, and the balance over two years, with a m in imum remittance in any one year of the foreign currency equivalent of J$20,000. In Ju ly 1987 a debt-equity program was introduced for the conversion of certain commercial bank debts into equity investments in approved public and private sector entities. Under this program, profit repatriation is pro- hibited for three years, and capital repatriation is also prohibited for three years for investments in priority sectors, and for seven years for investments in other qualified sectors. Gold Commemorative gold coins in denominations of J$20, J$100, and J$250 are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Jamaica for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents, other than the monetary authorities and authorized in- dustrial users, are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. All commercial imports of jewelry require import licenses. Changes During 1987 Administration of Control July 15. The exchange control authority for most current transactions was delegated to commercial banks. Com- mercial banks were authorized to sell foreign exchange subject to the provisions of suitable documentation for the following payments: business and other travel; medical expenses; foreign exchange re funds; cash gifts; pensions; and miscellaneous paymen ts, such as registration and subscription fees. All other service payments require prior approval of the Bank of Jamaica. Payments for Invisibles January 14. The basic allowance for nonbusiness travel abroad was raised from US$56 to US$150 per person. July 15. Certain remittances, which previously had been generally prohibited, were permitted, subject to limits of US$1,000 a year for remittance from emigrants' property income, US$1,000 a year for remittance for ©International Monetary Fund.

An export rebate of 7V6 percent on f.o.b. value was introduced for exporters of manufactured goods to non-CARicoM countries, excluding petroleum products and garments assembled from materials imported from the United States. Capital July 28. A debt-equity program was introduced for the conversion of certain commercial bank debts into equity investments in approved public and private sector entities. Under this program the repatriation of profits will be prohibited for three years, and capital repatriation will also be prohibited for three years for investments in priority sectors, and for seven years for investments in other qualified sectors. JAMAICA 289 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JAPAN (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Japan is the Japanese Yen. The authorities of Japan do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and exchange rates are deter- mined on the basis of underlying demand and supply conditions in the exchange markets. However, the au- thorities intervene when necessary in order to counter disorderly conditions in the markets. The principal inter- vention currency is the U.S. dollar. The interbank rate for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1987 wasY 122.0 per US$1. Authorized banks may freely carry out spot and forward exchange transactions with their customers, non- resident banks, and among themselves. Forward exchange contracts may be negotiated against foreign currencies quoted on the Tokyo exchange market and in other major international foreign exchange markets. There are no officially set rates in the forward market, and forward exchange transactions are based on free market rates. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Japan formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from April 1, 1964. Administration of Control The exchange control system is operated mainly by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), and the Bank of Japan acting as the Government's agent. Most of the authority for verifying normal payments is, however, delegated to authorized banks, referred to as foreign exchange banks. Import and export reporting requirements are handled by the MITI. Inward direct investments are under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Finance and other appropriate ministers. Outward direct investment requires prior notice to the Minister of Finance. Prescription of Currency Payments to all countries may be made in any currency, including yen, and receipts also may be obtained in any currency. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident accounts in yen may be opened by any nonresident with any authorized bank in Japan. There are no restrictions on credits to or payments from these accounts, and balances may be converted freely into any foreign currency. Payment of interest on balances in such accounts may be restricted when it is deemed necessary to prevent drastic fluctuations in the exchange rate of the yen. Imports and Import Payments Imports can be freely made, with the exception of specifically restricted items. The Import Restriction Sys- 290 tem covers 80 items (4-digit CCCN base), 23 of which have been communicated to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as residual restrictions, while the remaining items fall under the state-trading, national security, public health, and moral protection provisions of the GATT. For the restricted items, once the importer has obtained authorization from the MITI, he receives an import quota certificate that entitles him to receive an import license from an authorized foreign exchange bank automatically upon application. For the importation of certain other goods from specified countries or shipping areas, individual authorization must be obtained from the MITI. Items under state trading include beef, certain dairy products, certain cereals, salt, and ethyl and denatured alcohol. Payments for imports may be effected up to two years before the import declaration or after customs clearance. Longer settlement periods require an import license from the MITI. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles may be made without any limitation. Gifts and donations to nonresidents (except relatives abroad) exceeding Y 5 million are referred to the Bank of Japan, which approves the payment after veri- fy ing its authenticity. However, remittances to relatives abroad, as well as other current payments for invisibles, such as the purchase of foreign currencies in connection with travel abroad, may be made without limit. Both residents and nonresidents may acquire foreign currency deposits with authorized banks in Japan and may take out freely any amount in any foreign currency; in the case of Japanese yen, the freely exportable limit i s Y5 million. Overseas deposits by resident individuals up to the equivalent of Y10 million are subject to automatic approval by the Bank of Japan. Qualified Japanese en- terprises in insurance, transportation, securities, etc., are permitted to acquire overseas deposits under blanket licensing. Exports and Export Proceeds Export restraint may be exercised by virtue of the Export and Import Transactions Law and an Export Trade Control Order issued under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law. Export restraint may be applied either globally or to specified destinations, and it may cover export volume, export prices, or other con- ditions. Following expiration at end-March 1987 of the voluntary restraint arrangement on exports of passenger cars to the United States, the Government announced its intention to limit voluntarily the quantities over the period April 1987 to March 1988. Exports of steel and some textile items to the United States and forklift trucks to the European Communities (EC) are subject to quanti- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution tative restrictions. The quan t i ty and the prices of exports of video tape recorders to the EC are subject to monitoring by the Japanese Government. At the end of 1987, there were 54 export cartels under the provisions of the Export and Import Transactions Law. Of these, 5 required prior notice of exporters' agreements in respect of export transactions, 13 required prior approval of manufacturers' agreements on domestic transactions in goods for export, and 36 required prior notice of a memorandum of an exporters' cooperative association in respect of export transactions. In addition, 183 items were subject to license under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law, in order to control their export to specified socialist countries, or because of short supply in the domestic market (e.g., tungsten ore), or to forestall the imposition of import restrictions by other countries (e.g., on sewing machines and certain textiles). Exports under processing contracts and exports for which settlement is under the '"special" method also require individual licenses. Exports of spec- ified raw materials for foreign processing and reimport require individual licenses; "special" settlement methods are those effected by means of open account or those involving payment not earlier than two years after shipment. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles may generally be accepted without a license. Residents as well as nonresidents may bring in freely any amount in Japanese or foreign currency. Capital Capital transactions are, in principle, free unless spe- cifically required to follow certain procedures. Such specific procedures may take the form of requiring (1) prior approval; (2) prior notice with a waiting period, during which the minister or ministers concerned may request or order that the transaction be suspended or its particulars be modified on the basis of prescribed criteria; or (3) prior notice without a waiting period. Under emergency conditions, however, most capital transactions not subject to prior approval in normal conditions may be subject to prior approval. Emergency conditions are defined as situations in which a capital transaction might (1) make the maintenance of equilibrium in Japan's balance of payments difficult; (2) result in drastic fluctua- tions in the exchange rate; or (3) result in an international flow of funds large enough to adversely affect Japan's money or capital market. A distinction is made between direct investment in Japan and other capital transactions. Besides majority equity ownership of enterprises or establishment of branch operations, other types of inves tment that come under the direct investment regulations include (1) any acqui- sition of shares in unlisted companies; (2) acquisition by a foreign investor of the shares of a listed company (including individual companies for which the stock price in over-the-counter transactions is made public by the Securities Dealers Association) that reaches 10 percent or more when added to those owned by related persons; JAPAN and (3) acquisition of loans of more than one-year maturity or securities privately placed in Japan, under certain circumstances. Any change of business objectives of a company with one-third or more foreign ownership is also subject to the provisions for direct investment. Requests or orders for suspension or modification of specific aspects of the transaction may be made if the minister or ministers concerned consider the transaction to have adverse implications for national security, public order, public safety, the activities of Japanese enterprises in related lines of activities, the general performance of the economy, or for the maintenance of mutual equality of treatment of direct investment with other countries. Acquisition of securities for portfolio through desig- nated securities firms can be made freely, and foreign exchange banks and designated institutional investors can acquire freely securities for portfolio investments. How- ever, acquisition of such securities through securities firms other than the designated ones requires prior notice without a waiting period. Transactions requiring prior notice with a 20-day waiting period may be subject to suspension or modification by the Minister of Finance if, in his opinion, the transaction might adversely affect (1) domestic and international financial markets, (2) Japan's international reputation, (3) business activities of a sector of Japanese industries or the smooth performance of the national economy, and (4) implementation of Japan's international agreements, international peace and secu- rity, or the maintenance of public order. The Minister of Finance may shorten the notification period when the transaction under consideration is deemed unharmfu l. Other transactions by nonresidents may be generally carried out freely. Outward investments by residents in the form of loans, usance of not less than two years, issue of yen-denomi- nated bonds in Japan by nonresidents, and direct invest- ment abroad are subject to prior notice with a 20-day waiting period. The criteria for suspension or modification of specific aspects of such transactions are as in the preceding paragraph. Foreign currency deposits overseas by residents and borrowing and lending in foreign currency between residents other than those carried out by an authorized bank in Japan require prior approval. Other external transactions by residents may normally be carried out freely. Residents are permitted to issue currency conversion and floating rate Euro-yen bonds. Foreign loans by banks are legally subject to prior notice with a waiting period, but in most cases they can be made upon notification. The banks are free to lend yen on a long-term basis overseas to borrowers of their choice, and they can accept foreign currency deposits from residents and nonresidents and make foreign cur- rency loans to residents; foreign currency or yen deposits of nonresidents as well as residents are subject to mini- mum reserve requirements adjusted from time to time by the Bank of Japan. Foreign banks are licensed to operate in Japan subject to Japanese banking regulations; they may obtain resources from inward remittances of foreign currency as well as from money markets in Japan. 291 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JAPAN The following prudential guidelines are applied to cap- ital transactions by financial institutions: (1) a limit on the holding by insurance companies of securities issued by nonresidents equivalent to 30 percent of total assets; (2) the same ratio applied to purchases of foreign currency- denominated assets; (3) a limit on the holdings by the Post Office Insurance Fund of bonds issued by nonresi- dents equivalent to 20 percent of the reserve fund s; (4) a ceiling on foreign currency-denominated assets purchased by pension funds managed by trust banks equivalent to 30 percent of pension trust assets; (5) a ceiling on insurance companies' individual loans of Y 5 billion; (6) a ceiling on the investment by credit cooperatives in foreign currency- denominated securities issued by nonresidents equivalent to 30 percent of their net worth; and (7) a ceiling of 3 percent of assets for investment in foreign securities by the loan trust accounts of trust banks. Gold Residents, including domestic producers of gold, may freely hold gold and purchase and sell it in domestic transactions. The import and export of gold bullion are free from licensing. External futures trading in gold can be freely made by designated companies. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments April 1. Tariffs on 33 industrial products (subject to rates of 2 percent or less), alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, plywood and other wood products, and aluminum were unilaterally reduced. May 14. The "New Mayekawa Report" (a follow-up report to the Prime Minister by the Economic Council) was presented to the Prime Minister. This report reaf- firmed a commitment to promote the abolition of tariffs in the Uruguay Round of the GATT, and urged the government agencies to implement measures to improve access to the Japanese market. It also recommended that the Government examine the feasibility of removing regulations in the distribution sector, which are frequently cited by trading partners as a barrier to imports, and take the lead in import promotion through its own procurement procedures. August 16. The authorities implemented new proce- dures for public sector procurement of supercomputers, with a view to providing further transparency in the procedures and ensuring nondiscriminatory competitive opportunities for potential suppliers. September 30. International standards for imports of 47 electrical appliances were adopted. October 30. Administered prices for all agricultural products were reduced; in the case of rice, this was the first price cut in 31 years. November 24. A package of market-opening measures, including tariff cuts on some 30 industrial imports, was introduced. December 31. The following additional major steps were completed in the course of 1987 within the framework of the Action Program (of July 1985): (1) further simpli- fication of procedures; and (2) increase in the number of acceptances of foreign test data. Also, (1) the international convention on the harmonized commodity description and coding system for tariffs was adopted (on January 1, 1988); (2) the authorities urged some 300 major Japanese corporations firms to increase their import procurement; and (3) the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) offered to developing countries was extended through an increase in product quantity ceiling and coverage and duty exemptions for nine GSP products. Furthermore, the distribution of benefits from the GSP among devel- oping countries was made more equitable by a decrease in individual country limits to one fourth from one third of any GSP product ceiling. Exports and Export Proceeds January 1. Voluntary restraints were extended to ma- chine tool exports to the United States to reduce Japan's market share in numerically controlled punching and shearing machines by 24 percent, and in machinery centers by 21 percent. April 1. As in the previous two 12-month periods, a limit of 2.3 million units was applied to shipments of passenger cars to the United States for the period April 1, 1987-March31, 1988. April 1. Voluntary restraints and floor prices were introduced on exports of forklift trucks to the EC. August 18. The Japanese and U.S. authorities agreed that information should be exchanged between Japanese and U.S. auto parts suppliers, to help promote import expansion and purchasing of parts by Japanese auto manufacturers in the United States. Capital May 22. Certain Japanese banks and security compa- nies were allowed to transact financial fu tures abroad for their own accounts up to certain limits. June 4. The authorities published a report on "Plans for Further Liberalization of Domestic Financial and Capital Markets." 292 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JORDAN (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Jordan is the Jordan Dinar, which is pegged to the SDR at JD 0.387754 = SDR 1, within margins of 2.25 percent; the exchange rate has, however, been allowed to move within a wider band in recent years. The middle rate of the Jordan dinar for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is determined by the Central Bank of Jordan on the basis of the daily calcu- lations of the U.S. dollar-SDR rate. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates of the Central Bank for the U.S. dollar were US$3.0488 and US$3.0303, respec- tively, per JD 1, and those for sterling were £ stg 1.6276 and £ stg. 1.6179, respectively, per JD 1. Buying and selling rates for other foreign currencies1 are fixed on the basis of the appropriate cross rates in international finan- cial markets. A fee of 0.10 percent is levied on exchange permits approved by the Central Bank for sales of ex- change for imports, except imports of government de- partments and certain other approved institutions. Au- thorized dealers are permitted to enter into forward contracts in major currencies against the Jordanian dinar for specified commercial transactions, provided that they cover such operations abroad. The maturity of the con- tracts may be up to one year. Each authorized dealer's forward transactions are subject to quantitative limits. For corporations or projects considered to be of vital national interest, the Central Bank may offer a forward exchange facility in respect of forward exchange cover provided by Jordanian banks. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Foreign Ex- change Control Department of the Central Bank, which also issues exchange permits; the Central Bank has delegated to authorized banks the issuance of exchange permits for import payments and, within permitted annual limits, for payments for educational expenses of Jorda- nians studying abroad and for various other purposes. Import policy is determined by the Ministry of Industry and Trade in cooperation with the Ministries of Finance, Customs, Supply, and Agriculture. In addition, an Eco- nomic Security Committee is empowered to amend ex- isting regulations or issue new ones concerning economic policy. Prescription of Currency Outward payments may be made in any currency. Proceeds from exports (except those of Jordanian goods to all Arab countries, and fruits and vegetables to other countries) and invisibles must be collected, and surren- dered where required, in any convertible currency through 1 Belgian francs, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. an authorized bank in Jordan, or from a nonresident account with an authorized bank in Jordan. Nonresident Accounts Subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank, authorized banks may open nonresident accounts in domestic currency; these accounts may be credited only with approved funds. The approval of the Central Bank is necessary for transfers from resident to nonresident accounts, but transfers between nonresident accounts are permitted freely. In addition, nonresidents, including Jordanians working abroad, may freely open interest- bearing foreign currency accounts with authorized banks. Balances on these accounts may be withdrawn freely in convertible currency, and the interest rate is fixed in accordance with rates prevailing in international markets. Jordanian nationals residing in Jordan may maintain foreign currency deposits with licensed banks in Jordan, provided that such deposit accounts are credited with foreign currencies from any source except the banking system and that the total of the deposits that any one person holds does not exceed the equivalent of JD 30,000. Jordanians who have worked abroad for more than three years and have decided to return may open accounts in foreign currencies without limits for a period of up to five years, after which the deposits in excess of the equivalent of JD 30,000 must be converted into Jordan dinars. Foreign Currency Accounts Deposit accounts denominated in foreign currency may be opened at the Central Bank by governmental and semigovernmental entities, as well as the specialized credit institutions, licensed finance companies, and do- mestic corporations of vital national interest (including those companies in which the Government owns more than 25 percent of the capital), provided that outstanding balances (including interest earnings) in each account do not exceed JD 1 million. This ceiling can be raised to JD 3 million in certain cases. Imports and Import Payments Imports of certain items2 from any source, and all imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. All other imports, unless covered by an agreement between Jordan and the exporting country (i.e., agricultural prod- ucts from neighboring countries), require import licenses if their c. & f. value exceeds JD 100. These are granted freely by the Ministry of Industry and Trade and are subject to a fee of 5 percent of the c. & f. value payable on the issue of the import license. 2 These include carbonic acid, some nonalcoholic beverages, cigarettes, secondhand passenger cars and buses that are more than five years old, and military uniforms. Certain of these commodities may be imported, however, from Arab Common Market countries and from countries with which trade agreements are in force. Imports of certain agricultural commodities may be prohibited in good crop years. 293 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JORDAN Imports that require an import license also require an exchange permit, which is granted automatically when an import license has been obtained; the importer holding an exchange permit may either open a letter of credit or pay against documents. A fee of 0.10 percent is levied on exchange permits for imports, except those made by government departments and certain approved institu- tions and individual permits of less than JD 500. The use of suppliers' credits is subject to prior approval by the Central Bank, which normally is given for essential imports only. In addition to import duties, a surcharge of 13 percent of the duty-paid value is levied on most imports to finance social welfare and the development of certain public facilities. Imports to Free Zones With the discontinuation of Central Bank issuance of exchange permits for imports to free zones and for transit trade, it is the importer's responsibility to provide foreign currencies to finance such transactions. Payments for Invisibles Remittances by postal order do not require exchange control approval, provided that they do not exceed JD 10 a person a month (JD 100 a person a month for Kuwait and Jordanian students in Yugoslavia, JD 50 for the United Kingdom, and US$125 for Algeria). Payments for the following types of invisibles are generally permitted within certain limits: remittances to residents' depen- dents; reasonable living expenses of Jordanian nationals abroad; expenses of Jordanian residents traveling abroad; educational expenses; expenses for medical treatment; business expenses abroad; and insurance payments in accordance with special regulations.3 A fee of 0.10 percent is levied on exchange permits for invisible payments except those of government depart- ments and certain approved institutions, permits financed from nonresident accounts in foreign currency, and those with a value under JD 500. No limit exists on the remittance of income accrued to nonresidents or savings of foreign nationals who intend to return to their own countries. The exchange allowance for business and tourist travel is the equivalent of JD 5,000 a person (JD 500 for children under 18). These allowances are granted annually for one or more trips. For family support, an annual allowance of JD 5,000 for each beneficiary is permitted; however, remittances by postal order may be made for amounts not exceeding the equivalent of JD 10 a month to any one person resident abroad (JD 100 a month for Kuwait and Jordanian students in Yugoslavia, JD 50 for the United Kingdom, and US$125 for Algeria), and are not subject to this ceiling. The policy in respect of payments for invisibles is, in general, liberal and nondiscriminatory. In practice, the Central Bank does not restrict remittances of income accruing to nonresidents or of savings of foreign nationals returning to their own countries. In addition to any travel allocation, residents and nonresidents traveling abroad may take out up to JD 300 in Jordanian notes and coin and any amount in foreign notes and coin, provided these are for their own use. Nonresidents working in Jordan can transfer 70 percent of their salaries if they maintain a nonresident Jordanian dinar account; if they do not have such accounts, they can transfer up to JD 100 monthly with a total amount not exceeding JD 1,200 annually. Furthermore, all trav- elers may take out checks, traveler's checks, or letters of credit issued by authorized banks in Jordan, in ac- cordance with exchange permits authorized by the Central Bank. Tourists and other nonresidents may also take out foreign currency notes and coin and any other foreign means of payment that they had previously brought in and declared to the customs authorities at the time of entry. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Export proceeds must be collected and the foreign ex- change surrendered within six months of shipment. Ex- empt from this requirement are the proceeds from exports of Jordanian products to neighboring Arab countries, and proceeds of up to JD 300 from exports (excluding fruits and vegetables) to other countries. Exporters and resi- dents of Jordan are not permitted to maintain bank balances abroad for any purpose. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to an authorized bank or, if bank notes and traveler's checks are received, to an authorized bank or to an authorized exchange dealer. Travelers entering Jordan may bring in any amount in Jordanian and foreign notes and coin.4 Any person regarded for exchange control purposes as resident in Jordan may be required by the Central Bank to surrender to an authorized bank any foreign currency at his disposal. Capital Capital may be imported freely, but exports of capital require approval and are not normally allowed, except that the Central Bank is prepared to examine applications by banks, insurance companies, industrial or trading firms, and contractors for permission to transfer funds abroad for specified investment or operating purposes. Current income resulting from nonresident investments in Jordan may be transferred abroad. Under the Law for the Encouragement of Investment, profits from approved foreign investments may be remitted, without limitation, in any convertible currency. After two years, repatriation of the capital is permitted in three equal annual install- 3 All insurance must be taken out in Jordan, but foreign exchange is granted for premiums in respect of insurance contracts concluded prior to May 1965. 4 Approval is not given for the crediting of such Jordanian currency to a nonresident account or for the remittance abroad of the equivalent in foreign currency. 294 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JORDAN ments in any convertible currency. The Investment Com- mittee may approve more liberal provisions, and exchange permits are granted accordingly. The Foreign Companies Registration Law No. 46 of 1975 provides various benefits for foreign companies establishing branches in Jordan for the purpose of conducting business outside the country; such branches may also be granted nonresident status for exchange control purposes. Premium Development Bonds denominated in Jordan dinars may be purchased with convertible currencies by nonresidents; maturity pro- ceeds, premiums, and interest are transferable in any convertible currency. Gold The Central Bank has issued ten gold coins. These coins, although legal tender, do not circulate and are available only to nonresidents and domestic numismatists. Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Jordan for numismatic or investment purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not, in principle, allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Licenses for imports of gold in any form other than jewelry are issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade on the recommendation of the Central Bank, while exports of gold in any form require a license from the Central Bank. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 295 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KENYA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Kenya is the Kenya Shilling, which is pegged to a basket of currencies. The middle rate of the Kenya shilling for the U.S. dollar quoted by the Central Bank is determined on the basis of the daily U.S. dollar- SDK rate. The Central Bank's buying and selling rates are each set at 0.15 percent below and above the rate thus determined. On December 31,1987 buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were K Sh 16.4901 and K Sh 16.5397, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are determined on the basis of New York U.S. dollar closing rates for the currencies concerned. The Central Bank does not deal in other foreign currencies, except occasionally on behalf of the Government. Commercial banks are authorized to enter into forward exchange contracts with their customers in pounds ster- ling, U.S. dollars, and deutsche mark, for periods of up to six months at premia or discounts administratively set by the Central Bank. Forward cover is permitted for trade transactions only. Commercial banks may also cover their forward exchange contracts in outside markets in other foreign currencies against U.S. dollars or pounds sterling, but they are not permitted to hold uncovered positions. The Central Bank deals up to six months forward with commercial banks. There are no official schemes for currency swaps or exchange rate guarantee schemes for external debt servicing. Administration of Control The Minister of Finance has delegated the administra- tion of exchange control to the Central Bank. Authority is delegated to the authorized banks for approving certain payments for imports, many payments for current invis- ibles, and some capital payments. Import controls are administered by the Director of Internal Trade in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The responsibility for issuing import licenses rests with the Director, to whom applications must be submitted by the importer in Kenya before orders are placed abroad. Applications for the allocation of foreign exchange for imports are forwarded by the Director to the Central Bank. The quota system is administered by the Import Management Committee (IMC), and the Official Import Committee (OIC) deals with policy issues on imports. Both of these committees are composed of representatives from the Ministries of Finance, Planning and National Development, Commerce and Indus try, and the Central Bank. The Director of External Trade in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry also deals with export promotion 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Bu rundi francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, Ethiopian birr, French francs, Indian rupees, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Rwanda francs, Swaziland emalangeni, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Tanzania shillings, Ugandan shillings, and Zambian kwacha. 296 and issues special licenses for the export of restricted goods such as maize and other food products. Most other goods may be exported with special licenses. Prescription of Currency Payments to residents of countries other than South Africa may be made in Kenya shillings to the credit of an External Account in Kenya or in any foreign currency. Receipts may be obtained in Kenya shillings from an External Account in Kenya or in any marketable foreign currency. Remittances to South Africa are prohibited, with the exception of pensions payable by the Government of Kenya. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in Kenya shillings held by residents of coun- tries other than South Africa with authorized banks in Kenya are, with exchange control approval, designated External Accounts. They may be credited freely with authorized payments to such countries by residents of Kenya, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of any currency (other than South African currency) and gold by nonresidents to authorized dealers. External Accounts may be debited freely for payments to residents and nonresidents. Nontransferable funds of nonresidents are credited to Blocked Accounts. Subject to prescribed procedures, balances on Blocked Accounts (other than those in the beneficial ownership of residents of South Africa) may be used for approved domestic expenditures and for the purchase in Kenya of specified bonds issued by the Government or by local authorities and officially quoted in Kenya .2 The redemption proceeds of these securities are transferable, and interest is freely transferable to nonresidents as and when it accrues. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. All imports are classified into four schedules —Schedules IA, IB, HAS, and IIB —and are subject to import licensing. Import licenses are valid for three or six months, de- pending on product categories. All private sector imports require a license to receive an allocation of foreign exchange, and licenses are issued jointly by the Director of Internal Trade and the Central Bank. Applications must be approved before firm orders can be placed. Category I consists of a list of high priority items classified under Schedules IA and IB. Items on IA are considered high priority and are given preference in import licensing. Licenses are approved by the Director of Internal Trade, and foreign exchange is allocated by the Central Bank. The approval of licenses is, in principle, 2 Such securities must be payable in Kenya shillings and they must not be redeemable earlier than five years from the date of acquisition. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution automatic, although approval may sometimes be withheld in cases where overstocking is thought to be taking place. Items on Schedule IB are given lower priority than those on IA. Items on Schedule HAS require advance govern- ment approval before application is made for an import license, and they are restricted to approved importers. (Some items on other import schedules also require advance government approval, but they are not restricted to particular importers.) Subschedule HB contains items that receive the lowest priority. These are either do- mestically manufactured or items for which domestic substitutes are available. Applications for foreign ex- change allocation licenses for imports are subject to a charge of 1.5 percent of the cost and freight value of the application. When an exchange allocation license has been obtained from the Central Bank or when such a license is not required, authorized banks are permitted to provide exchange against documents, but normally not prior to customs en try. Prior exchange control approval must be obtained for imports of capital goods on deferred payment terms, and for imports of machinery and equipment, which are regarded as a contribution toward equity capital or are to be accounted for on a loan basis. Most imports with a c. & f. value in excess of K Sh 50,000 are subject to preshipment inspection for quality, quantity, and price. A"C lean Report of Findings" must be obtained before shipment, and authorized banks in Kenya may not issue shipping guarantees for the clearance of imports un t il this Clean Report has been received. All goods purchased by importers in Kenya must be insured with companies licensed to transact insurance business in Kenya. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are controlled. Authorized banks are empowered to approve specified categories of current payments without limitation or up to established limits. Amoun ts above these limits as well as other current payments may be approved administratively, and most current payments are in practice unrestricted. Fees for education up to the equivalent of K Sh 24,000 a person for a fu ll scholastic year3 and fees for other specified purposes may be approved by an authorized bank upon presentation of evidence of debt. The Central Bank may approve higher remittances for education expenses. Foreign nationals who work in Kenya as employed persons (as well as certain categories of the self-employed, such as doctors and dentists) and have not been in the country for more than four years may remit abroad as savings up to one third of their monthly salaries but not more than K Sh 4,000 a mon th; in addition, they may remit funds to cover maintenance, educational expenses, etc., provided that their total remittances in- cluding savings do not exceed one half of their monthly 3 Authorized dealers are not allowed to remit any f u n ds for educational support to s tuden ts at primary or secondary schools who were not abroad in the 1975-76 academic year. KENYA salaries. Expatriates who have stayed for over four years may continue to remit from salaries as above, up to the end of the tenth year of their residence in Kenya, but in that case they are not entitled to transfer additional savings upon emigration within that period. Remittances to South Africa, other than certain pensions, are prohibited. Nonresident individual property owners may remit up to K Sh 20,000 of net rental income in each 12-month period. Any excess of net rent over the permitted transfer is placed in a Blocked Account and may be invested in approved securities with at least five years to maturity, after which period the redemption proceeds may be remitted to the nonresident beneficiary. Real estate com- panies deriving income solely from rent are permitted to transfer annually up to 10 percent of the book value of their properties as of September 25, 1970, or an amount not exceeding 10 percent of issued capital. Where income is derived from rent as well as other sources, applications must be made to the exchange control authorities for approval of remittance of such incomes. Exchange control approval is required for outward remittance of profits and dividends on nonresident equity holdings. The basic allowance for travel by adults holding round- trip tickets is K Sh 4,000 a person (K Sh 2,000 for children between 3 and 12 years of age) every two years. Holders of one-way tickets who have been granted emigration status or final departure rights are not entitled to the basic travel allowance, but to an allowance of K Sh 2,000 a person. The basic allowance is not available for travel to South Africa. Commercial banks may sell foreign ex- change for business travel to Tanzania and Uganda up to K Sh 400 a night for a maximum period of ten days at a time. Business travelers to other countries are granted an allowance of up to K Sh 1,500 a day for a maximum period of 20 days. A once-only hajj pilgrimage allowance of K Sh 16,000 for adults is available only to persons who have not used the basic travel allowance within the preceding two years. Nonresident travelers may take out freely any unutilized balance of foreign currency notes they brought in upon entry. Residents of Kenya traveling abroad on international flights and holding return tickets may carry up to K Sh 100 with them for local expenses on return, but otherwise the export of Kenya bank notes is prohibited. Temporarily, all sales of tickets to Kenyan residents for nongovernmental travel outside Kenya are subject to exchange control approval. Applications for travel tickets must be accompanied by a deposit of 10 percent of the value of the air ticket and 5 percent of the sea ticket, returnable only if the applications are not approved. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of certain foodstuffs and agricultural products require special licenses and may be subject to restriction to ensure adequate supplies in the domestic market. Exports of tea, coffee, minerals, precious stones, and other essential strategic materials are also subject to special licensing. Most other goods may be exported without special licen- 297 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KENYA ses other than exchange control approval. Coffee is marketed through the Coffee Board of Kenya. Export proceeds in foreign currencies must be collected within three months of exportation and offered to an authorized dealer in Kenya for conversion into Kenya shillings. Exports of manufactured goods with at least 30 percent domestic value added are eligible for compensation equiv- alent to 20 percent of the f.o.b. value. About 700 export items, other than coffee, tea, sugar, sisal, pyrethrum, horticultural products, petroleum products, soda ash, and most goods produced with raw material inputs not subject to import duty are covered by the export compensation scheme. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in foreign currencies must be sold to an authorized bank. Nonresidents must settle hotel bills in foreign currency or against an External Account. Travelers may bring in freely foreign currency notes, except those of countries with restrictions on exportation of their currencies. The import of domestic bank notes is prohibited, except that residents returning to Kenya may bring in up to K Sh 100 previously taken out by themselves. Capital Capital transfers to all countries are regulated. Transfers to South Africa are prohibited. With the exception of expatriate employees who have opted for remittance of savings from salaries, an emigrant is allowed to transfer up to K Sh 300,000 a family unit from his declared assets as a settling-in allowance to the new country of residence. Of this sum, K Sh 100,000 is made available for immediate remittance, and the remainder will be authorized for remittance in not more than five annual installments not exceeding the equivalent of K Sh 40,000 each year. The initial settling-in allowance of K Sh 100,000 lapses if it is not remitted within the first two years of the emigrant's departure from Kenya. All remaining funds must be credited to a Blocked Account; they may then be invested in approved securities, and redemption proceeds become transferable, provided that redemption does not take place earlier than five years from the date of purchase. If assets in Kenya are valued at K Sh 1 million or more, they must be liquidated before any exchange control approvals are sought and the proceeds must be invested in prescribed securities. The investment of foreign funds in Kenya is not generally restricted, but to ensure eventual repatriation it is necessary to obtain from the Treasury a "certificate of approved enterprise" for the investment. Foreign and domestic investment in specified types of production require approval. Local borrowing by non-resident-owned or non-resident-controlled companies, as well as borrow- ing by residents from nonresidents, requires exchange control approval and is restricted. All imports and exports of securities require approval. Approval is granted for the purchase by nonresidents of Kenyan securities on a recognized stock exchange, pro- vided that payment is received in an appropriate manner. The income from such securities is remittable, but the proceeds on resale must normally be credited to a Blocked Account unless they are reinvested. Residents are not normally permitted to purchase foreign securities. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Kenya for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized in- dustrial and professional users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require exchange control approval. Import licenses for gold bul- lion (ingots, bars, or sheets) are issued restrictively and only to goldsmiths, and imports of gold coin are not being licensed. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments June 26. The processing fee for foreign exchange allocation licenses for imports was increased from 1 percent to 1.5 percent. November 1. The validity period of import licenses was changed from 12 to 3 or 6 months, depending on product categories. Payments for Invisibles May 22. The hajj pilgrimage allowance was increased from K Sh 12,000 to K Sh 16,000. Capital February 23. Commercial banks were allowed to grant overdraft and other facilities to non-resident-owned com- panies up to amounts needed to pay for duties on imported capital equipment. 298 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KIRIBATI (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The official currency of Kiribati is the Australian Dollar; a small amount of Kiribati coins are also in circulation. There is no central monetary institution, and the author- ities do not buy or sell foreign exchange. The Bank of Kiribati quotes daily rates for 15 currencies1 on the basis of their respective values against the Australian dollar. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Kiribati formally accepted the obliga- tions of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from August 22, 1986. Prescription of Currency Both outward and inward payments may be settled in Australian currency or in any foreign currency.2 Purchases and sales of foreign currencies by residents in exchange for Australian dollars must be undertaken with an au- thorized foreign exchange dealer, of which the only one is the Bank of Kiribati.

Tariffs, which apply to most private imports, are imposed for revenue purposes. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions or limits imposed on payments for invisibles. Exports and Export Proceeds There are no surrender requirements for export pro- ceeds. There are no taxes or quantitative restrictions on exports, but copra can be exported only through the Kiribati Copra Cooperative Society. Capital The authorities maintain a liberal attitude toward foreign direct investment. Approval by the Foreign Investment Commission is required for all investments. Export- promoting or import-substituting investments are pre- ferred. Under the Foreign Investment Promotion Act, investors may be granted duty-free imports of capital goods and raw materials and a tax holiday of up to five years. Repatriation of profits and capital is normally unrestricted. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 299 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KOREA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Korea is the Korean Won, which is linked to a multicurrency basket (consisting of a trade- weighted basket and the SDR basket), but other factors are also taken into account if necessary. The Bank of Korea establishes daily the exchange rate of the won in terms of the U.S. dollar, which is the intervention cur- rency. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates of the Bank of Korea for the U.S. dollar were W 789.10 and W 795.50, respectively, per US$1, and the telegraphic transfer buying and selling rates of the foreign exchange banks were W 788.70 and W 795.90, respectively, per US$1. The buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are posted daily by foreign exchange banks on the basis of buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Foreign exchange banks may conduct forward trans- actions, fu tures transactions, swaps, and options between foreign currencies as well as between the Korean won and foreign currencies. There are no specific restrictions on the terms of forward contracting in respect of interbank transactions. However, the terms of forward contracts between a foreign exchange bank and a nonbank customer must be based on a bona fide transaction, and the contract amount must not exceed the expected receipt or payment on the transaction. Administration of Control The Ministry of Finance initiates policy with respect to prescription of currency and method of settlement, foreign exchange operations, payments for nonmerchan- dise transactions, and capital transactions and transfers. It also prepares and administers the Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Plan, which sets overall ceilings on the amounts of foreign exchange that may be used. The Bank of Korea, as the Government's agent, executes most of the above functions; it also regulates operations in the exchange market and is authorized to intervene in it. The Bank has been delegated authority to control payments related to invisibles and certain capital trans- actions. The foreign exchange banks, as well as the branch offices in Korea of foreign banks, are authorized to engage in commercial international banking and in all foreign exchange dealings, with the exception of those specifically prohibited. Prescription of Currency All settlements between Korea and other countries are made in convertible currencies. The proceeds of exports must be obtained in prescribed currencies.1 1 In addition to the Hong Kong dollar and the Swiss f ranc, the list of prescribed currencies comprises the currencies of the member coun tr ies of the Fund that have accepted the obligations of Article V I II of the Fund's Articles of Agreement. 300 Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents, including Korean workers abroad, may maintain foreign currency deposit accounts with foreign exchange banks. Remittances from such accounts and withdrawals in the form of currency notes upon departure from Korea may, in general, be made freely. The approval of the bank where the account is held is not required for remittances abroad or transfers to other foreign currency accounts, for withdrawals of foreign means of payment and purchases of other foreign means of payment, or for sales to a foreign exchange bank in exchange for domestic means of payment or paymen ts for approved transactions. The deposit may be disposed of by sale to a foreign exchange bank at the prevailing exchange rate and may be debited for salaries paid to foreign employees. All residents are allowed to open foreign currency deposit accounts. The holders of these accounts may change the currency composition of these accounts as they wish. Imports and Import Payments All imports require licenses; for certain imports (see below), licenses are issued upon application. Imports are divided into two categories: automatic approval or re- stricted items. All commodities may be imported freely (i .e ., applications for import licenses are automatically approved), unless they are on a list of restricted items. On December 31, 1987 out of 7,911 basic items on the Customs Cooperation Council Nomenclature (CCCN), 503 were classified as restricted items. Imports of raw materials for the production of exports are normally approved automatically, irrespective of their classifica- tion. However, in order to limit increases in recently liberalized imports, the authorities have the right to place items on an import surveillance list, which means that approval from the Korea Traders' Association is required before an import license can be opened. At the end of December 1987, only 562 items were on the surveillance list. Import licenses are granted only to registered traders; to maintain the status of a registered trader, ordinary exporters are required to export a m in imum value of US$0.5 million for at least one or two calendar years. The commercial terms of payment on which imports may be contracted are regulated. A 15 percent advance deposit is required when usance (deferred payment) or sight letters of credit are opened. The customs tariff is a "flexible" tariff. To limit increases in recently liberalized import items, ad jus tment tariffs of up to 100 percent may be applied in addition to the basic tariff rates. Ad jus tment tariffs may be applied only to recently liberalized items; they are subject to 2 On Janua ry 1, 1988, 8 additional items were removed, leaving 48 items on the list. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution review every six months, up to a maximum cumulative period of three years. Emergency tariffs of up to 40 percent may be applied temporarily to discourage nonessential imports (mainly luxury goods) or to assist a domestic industry facing in jury due to a surge in imports. As of end-December 1987, no ad jus tment tariffs were applied, and seven items were subject to emergency tariffs. On July 1, 1987 a new Trade Act came into effect, which, among other things, introduced a system of safe- guards against import surges that is more comprehensive and less restrictive than the system of import surveillance lists and adjustment tariffs. Under the provisions of the Trade Act, a five-member Trade Commission was estab- lished on July 1, 1987; the Trade Commission will judge if imports of foreign products have harmed domestic industries. If substantial damage is ascertained, the Trade Commission will recommend the form of import relief to be provided. Possible measures include imposing quotas or other restrictions on the import category in terms of quantity, quality, or other relevant factors. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require individual licenses. Payments for invisibles connected with foreign trade and for certain other items, such as banking charges, insurance premiums, communication fees, and periodicals, are li- censed automatically. In addition, Korean companies are authorized to use foreign exchange for the expenses of their overseas branches. Residents traveling abroad may, in general, purchase foreign exchange up to the equivalent of US$5,000 per trip as the basic travel allowance;3 additional foreign exchange may also be purchased for specified expenses, including transportation costs. The monthly allowance for residents staying abroad for over 60 days is US$3,000 (allowance for Korean nationals working in an overseas branch of a firm is US$10,000). The basic monthly allowance for students living abroad is US$1,500 per individual, and for students with a fam i ly, an additional allowance of US$500 for the spouse and US$300 for each child is granted. Korean currency notes in excess of W 500,000 and foreign currency notes may not be exported without special permission. Upon leaving the country, nonresidents may acquire foreign exchange up to the amount for which they have proof of conversion. Credit card holders are allowed to charge all travel expenses without limit during business and official travel to foreign countries. In addition, they may carry US$5,000 for cash payments. Foreigners employed by Korean and expatriate firms in Korea may remit their salaries, except for basic living expenses, and retirement allowances to their home countries. Korean residents are allowed to remit up to US$5,000 a year as living expenses to their parents and children living abroad, and up to US$1,000 to their relatives abroad for weddings or funerals. 3 Those who are visiting countries whose currencies have appreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar can carry an additional US$2,500. KOREA Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports on a restricted list require individual licenses. All other exports may be made freely under an automatic approval procedure. Foreign exchange pro- ceeds from exports must either be surrendered to a foreign exchange bank at its posted customer rate, or be deposited in foreign exchange accounts in banks. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds derived from invisibles must either be sold to a foreign exchange bank for won or be deposited in foreign exchange accounts in the banks. Nonresidents must register the foreign exchange that they bring into Korea if the amount exceeds the equivalent of US$5,000. The import by travelers of Korean currency in excess of W 500,000 is restricted. The proceeds received by construction companies from construction activity abroad must be deposited in foreign currency accounts, and the conversion of these deposits is subject to approval by a foreign exchange bank after ascertaining the bona fide nature of the transactions; approval is given virtually automatically. Capital All overseas investments and loans by residents to nonresidents require approval. The foreign exchange allowance for emigration is subject to a limit of US$50,000 for the head of household and US$10,000 for each family member. Additional allowance for emigrant investment abroad is subject to the recommendation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Foreign exchange banks may grant authorization for such remittances. Regulations governing foreign investment in Korea and the contracting of loans to residents by nonresidents are as follows. Foreign Investment The Amended Foreign Capital Inducement Act (1983), wh ich came into effect on Ju ly 1, 1984, provides that direct inve s tment will be allowed in all indus t r ies, except those specified in a "negative" list; prev ious ly, direct inves tment was allowed only in industries belonging to a "positive" list. As of December 31, 1987, the negative list comprised 211 out of a total of 999 indus tr ial sectors, imp ly ing a liberalization ratio of 79 percen t. In the manu fac tu r ing indus t r ies, the negative list comprised 13 out of 522 sectors, imp ly ing a liberalization ratio of 98 percen t. The negative list d is t ingu ishes be tween "prohibited" and "restricted" sectors. The fo rmer are activities reserved exclusively for the Gove rnment or public en t i t ies, or those that may be in jur ious to public health or moral standards. Restricted activities are no t, in general, open to foreign inve s tmen t, but specific projects may be approved on a case-by-case basis. Partnership with local firms is no longer required of foreign-invested companies. Tax privileges may be granted to foreign-invested projects that make a significant con- tribution to improving the balance of payments and to those accompanied by the transfer of advanced technol- 301 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KOREA ogy. As of July 1, 1987, tax privileges were reduced and after-investment controls were relaxed to treat foreign companies and local companies on the same basis. Au- tomatic approval is now applied to investments that satisfy the following requirements: (1) the value of the investment does not exceed US$3 million; (2) the share of the foreigner is less than 50 percent; and (3) tax privileges do not apply. Acquisition of land by foreign-invested companies is subject to the approval of provincial and local govern- ments. Investment approval is normally granted within 30 days, and in the case of automatic approval, within 10 days. The overseas remittance of dividends and legitimate profits accrued from stocks or shares owned by a foreign investor is freely permitted. The repatriation of foreign capital is freely permitted. Overseas investments by Korean residents of less than US$1 million are authorized automatically if the documentary requirements are met. Investments of less than US$5 million are no longer subject to government deliberation. Korean businesses incorporated abroad are allowed to retain profits up to US$0.5 million, or 20 percent of invested funds for manufacturing purposes. Loans Authorization is required for foreign borrowing. Foreign borrowing of more than US$1 million and with a maturity in excess of three years is governed by the Foreign Capital Inducement Act. Foreign borrowing repayable within three years is governed by the Foreign Exchange Control Act. Regu- lations governing the use of foreign borrowing for short- term trade finance have been tightened on several occa- sions in recent years. At the end of December 1987, the maximum maturity for trade credits (usance letters of credit) was limited to 30 days for imports from Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, and Taiwan Province of Chinat (on account of their geographical proximity), and 60 days for imports originating in other countries, except that if Korea has a trade surplus with the latter countries, the issuance period may be extended to 90 days. Subject to certain ceilings, foreign bank branches can enter into foreign currency swap transactions with the Bank of Korea at a fixed yield of 1A percent to secure funds for their domestic currency lending. Gold Certain commemorative gold coins are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may freely buy, hold, and sell gold in any form in Korea. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the Bank of Korea or a foreign exchange bank. The import of gold for industrial or medical purposes requires approval by a foreign exchange bank. Domestically produced gold may be disposed of in the free market. t See Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 61. 302 Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement October 1. The regulations on the period of forward exchange contracts between the won and foreign curren- cies, previously limited to one year or less, were abol- ished. Foreign exchange banks were allowed to conduct forward transactions, fu tures transactions, swaps, and options to cover the risks caused by the fluctuations in exchange and interest rates not only between foreign currencies but also between the Korean won and foreign currencies. All forward contracts between a foreign ex- change bank and a nonbank resident customer must be based on bona fide transactions, and the contracted amount must not exceed the value of receipt of payment of such transactions. However, there are no restrictions on contractual terms in respect of interbank transactions. Imports and Import Payments January 1. The tariff rate on crude oil imports was raised from 5 percent to 24.5 percent. July 1. A total of 167 items was removed from the restricted import list, raising the number of automatically approved items to 7,408 out of a total of 7,911 items under the CCCN eight-digit classification. At the same time, 47 items were removed from the surveillance list, leaving 59 items on the list. It was announced at the same time that three additional items would be removed from the list on September 1, 1987 and a further eight items on January 1, 1988. Also, the adjustment tariff was abolished for the five items, and two of these items were subject to emergency tariffs, bringing the total of items subject to such rates to seven, at rates of 5-19.5 percentage points above the normally imposed tariff rates. July 1. A new Foreign Trade Act, which included a revised system of import protection, entered into effect. Under the provisions of the Act, the Korea Trade Com- mission (consisting of five members) was established. The Commission will examine petitions for protection against import surges. Payments for Invisibles May 4. Credit card holders, in addition to the basic allowance limits, were allowed to pay medical charges, buy materials and books, and charge expenses needed for business operations with their credit cards on business trips to foreign countries. They were also allowed to carry up to US$1,000 in extra cash, and US$2,000 if they plan to visit two countries for periods longer than ten days. Previously, only airline and transportation charges, hotel charges, and food could be paid with credit cards, and only US$500 in extra cash was permitted. Also, Koreans traveling to "strong currency countries" would be able to spend US$4,000 without authorization, compared with the general allowance of US$3,000. May 4. The basic monthly allowance for students abroad was increased from US$1,000 to US$1,500. In addition, US$500 for the spouse and US$300 for each child was allowed. Previously, only US$500 was allowed for addi- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution tional living expenses. The basic US$2,000 settlement expenses and US$1,000 for each family member remained unchanged. June 1. The amount that Koreans and foreign residents in Korea can carry on each overseas trip to visit relatives or on trips for other nonbusiness purposes was increased from US$1,000 to US$2,000. A similar increase was made for those who leave for overseas employment. July 27. Foreigners employed by Korean and expatriate firms in Korea were allowed to send their salary, except for basic living expenses, and retirement allowances to their home countries with approval from a foreign ex- change bank rather than from the Bank of Korea. In addition, Korean residents were permitted to remit up to US$5,000 a year as living expenses to their parents and children living in foreign countries under these simplified procedures. They were also permitted to send up to US$500 to their relatives abroad for weddings or funerals. September 1. The age restriction on tourists traveling abroad was lowered from 50 to 45, and those going abroad were no longer required to deposit W 2 million for a year. December 28. Koreans traveling abroad were allowed to carry US$5,000 in cash each for basic expenses, regardless of travel purposes. Previously, each Korean could carry US$2,000 to US$3,000, depending on the purpose of the trip. Further, under the new rules those who visit countries whose currencies have appreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar will be able to carry an additional US$2,500. At the same time, credit card holders were allowed to charge all travel expenses without limit during business and official travel to foreign coun- tries. In addition, they were allowed to take US$5,000 for cash payments, compared with US$2,000 previously. The new regulations also enabled Korean residents to send up to US$ 1,000 to their relatives abroad for weddings or funerals, compared with US$500 previously. Exports and Export Proceeds July 1. Exports of ten items to the United States, including VCRs, microwave ovens, and T.V. sets, were subject to voluntary export restraints. Proceeds from Invisibles July 14. Inward remittances by Koreans residing abroad exceeding US$20,000 would be monitored to discourage speculation in the stock market and the real estate market. KOREA Capital April 6. An additional 26 manufacturing sectors were opened to foreign investment, leaving 13 of the 522 manufacturing sectors closed to foreign investment. April 21. Domestic banks were authorized to extend the usance period from 60 days to 90 days for imports of raw materials and parts from countries with which Korea has a trade surplus. The usance period for Japan and other neighboring countries remains at 30 days, regardless of trade balances. April 21. Imports from countries with which Korea has a trade surplus were not made eligible for importation on a usance basis without the requirements regarding the tariff level. Imports from other countries on a usance basis would continue to be subject to the requirement that tariffs be lower than 10 percent generally and lower than 5 percent in the case of Japan, Hong Kong, and neighboring southeast Asian countries, regardless of the trade balance. May 1. To encourage overseas investment by Korean firms, the upper limit for overseas investment exempted from prior government screening was raised from US$2 million to US$3 million. July I. Certain tax privileges granted to attract foreign direct investment were reduced and after-investment controls relaxed to put foreign-invested companies and local companies on the same basis. Authority to approve direct foreign investments that are subject to automatic approval was delegated to the Bank of Korea. September 1. Restrictions on the purchase by Korean- owned companies of foreign real estate were liberalized. The new measures also allowed Korean businesses in- corporated abroad to retain up to US$500,000 of their operating profits, compared to US$100,000 in the past. Overseas investments of less than US$500,000 were authorized automatically if documentary requirements were met; previously, overseas investments exceeding US$200,000 were required to be approved by the Bank of Korea. December 28. Overseas investments by Korean resi- dents of less than US$1 million were to be automatically approved, compared to US$500,000 in the past, and the upper limit on investment to be free from government screening was increased from US$3 million to US$5 million, regardless of purposes of investment. 303 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KUWAIT (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Kuwait is the Kuwaiti Dinar. The exchange value of the Kuwaiti dinar is determined on the basis of a fixed but adjustable relationship between the Kuwaiti dinar and a weighted basket of currencies that takes into account Kuwait's trade and financial relations with other countries. For exchange transactions with local banks in the intervention currency, the U.S. dollar, the Central Bank of Kuwait normally sets margins of 0.01 percent on either side of the middle rate. The Central Bank sets the rate for the U.S. dollar on the basis of the latest available market quotations for that currency in relation to the other currencies included in the basket. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates of the Central Bank for the U.S. dollar were KD 0.26973 and KD 0.27007, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The most common arrangement for forward cover against exchange rate risk operating in the official and the com- mercial banking sectors is handled through dealings in the international forward exchange markets. On April 5, 1963 Kuwait formally accepted the obli- gations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control There is no exchange control, and residents and non- residents may freely purchase and sell foreign currencies in Kuwait. Dealings in the currencies of Israel and South Africa are prohibited.1 General and individual import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. A limited control over exports is administered by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Customs and Ports Administration. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Trade and economic agreements are maintained with the People's Republic of China, Italy, Jordan, and Thailand. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may freely open accounts in Kuwaiti dinars and foreign currencies. The use of such accounts is not restricted. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are required for all commercial imports other than fresh fruit and vegetables; licenses, except for wheat and flour, are issued freely to registered Kuwaiti merchants and companies. Registered importers handling 1 In addition, all imports from these countries and all exports to them are prohibited; paymen ts may not be made to them or be received from them for any type of transaction. 304 a variety of commodities may obtain a general license valid for one year. Other importers must obtain specific licenses for individual commodities, which also are valid for one year. Imports of industrial equipment, machinery, and their spare parts require industrial licenses, valid for one-time use. Licenses are issued to registered and licensed industrial establishments after the approval of the Industrial Development Commission at the Ministry of Commerce and Indus try. Private imports of personal objects may be permitted under individual or specific licenses. Importation of certain items (mainly oxygen, certain steel and asbestos pipes, pork or foodstuffs con- taining pork, alcoholic beverages, used vehicles over five years old, portable telephones, chewing tobacco, and gas cylinders) is prohibited. Commercial imports are limited to registered importers. To be registered, the importer must be either a Kuwaiti citizen or a firm in which all partners are Kuwaiti nationals, or a shareholding or limited liability company in which Kuwaiti nationals own at least 51 percent of the stock. Imports from any permitted source may be paid freely. In concert with other member states of the Gulf Co- operation Council (GCC) (Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates), Kuwait adopted a uniform tariff structure on September 1, 1983. In line with the GCC Ministerial Council Resolution adopted on May 18-19, 1983, a minimum tariff of 4 percent was fixed on imports from non-GCC states; tariffs on imports from other GCC countries, which have a local value-added component of at least 40 percent, were abolished. In August 1985, in line with a GCC resolution, Kuwait adopted a system of preferential tariffs allowing industries catering to at least 40 percent of the local market to apply for tariff protection. Tariff rates d iffer, depending on the domestic value-added content of the products in question. If the domestically produced goods contain at least 20 percent, 30 percent, or 40 percent of domestic value added, protective duties of 15 percent, 20 percent, or 25 percent, respectively, may be applied. The degree of protection given by the formula is reduced by 5 percent in the case of consumer goods. In 1985 tariffs of between 15 percent and 25 percent were applied to such products as gypsum, Portland cement, fiberglass, paper products, biscuits, glass bottles, and linens. During 1986 customs tariffs continued to be used for the protection of domestically produced goods; in this context, the list of items receiving similar tariff protection was expanded to include paint, building materials, rein- forced glass products, commercial refrigeration units, central air conditioning un i ts w i th a capacity of 20-25 tons, electric and telephone cables, and synthetic sponges. In 1987 the tariffs on steel and iron that had been removed in 1986 were reinstated. Imports of portable telephones, chewing tobacco, and gas cylinders were prohibited for health or safety reasons. In line w i th a resolution of the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution November 1986 session of the GCC, Kuwait adopted a priority system for government procurement of goods and services, which provides for preference to be accorded to Kuwaiti-produced goods up to a price margin of 5 percent over goods produced in other GCC states and 10 percent over goods produced outside the GCC. Simi- larly, goods produced in other GCC states are accorded a 5 percent price margin over goods produced outside the GCC. In total, some 46 items receive tariff protection from the Government. The max imum du ty that may be imposed on products that compete with locally manufactured goods is 100 percent. As a general rule, protection is accorded to a firm only if the value added is in excess of 40 percent. Imports are subject to customs du t ies at a m in imum rate of 4 percent. Imports of foodstuffs as well as some industrial establishments' imports of machinery and equipment, spare parts, and raw materials are exempt from import duties. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of live sheep and poultry and of certain other items (such as sugar, fa ts, rice, meat, eggs, milk, cheese, butter, olive oil, fresh f ru i ts, vegetables in any fo rm, beans, lentils, chick-peas, jams, and cement) may be prohibited in time of emergency or shortage in Kuwait. These items may be exported in limited quantities on ly, under a special license issued by the Ministry of Com- merce and Indus t ry. Exports of arms and ammun i t ion require licenses. Licenses are not required for other exports or re-exports. There are no requirements attached to receipts from exports or re-exports; the proceeds need not be repatriated or surrendered, and they may be disposed of free ly, regardless of the currency involved. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles All payments for current invisibles may be made freely. Travelers may bring in or take out any amount in Kuwaiti or other bank notes. Capital There are no exchange controls or restrictions on the transfer to Kuwait of resident or nonresident capital in any currency. Government agreement is necessary for the participation of nonresident capital in resident cor- KUWAIT porations in Kuwait; at least 51 percent of ownership of new Kuwaiti companies must be held by nationals. Beginning in 1983, the participation of nationals of coun- tries of the GCC in companies established in Kuwait may reach up to 75 percent of the capital. In January 1985 the Ministry of Commerce and Indus try resolved, in line with a GCC resolution, to eliminate restrictions regarding non- Kuwaiti participation in retail trade enterprises by GCC nationals as from March 1987. However, import licensing restrictions for non-Kuwaitis were to remain in effect for GCC nationals. No restrictions are imposed on outward capital transfers by residents or nonresidents. Dealings in domestic or foreign stocks in the official Kuwait Stock Exchange are subject to the approval of the Exchange Committee. Besides the approved domestic stocks, trad- ing is permitted in certain stocks of companies of GCC countries, but dealings are restricted to Kuwaiti citizens. The listing of Kuwaiti dinar-denominated bonds in the Exchange is subject to the approval of the Exchange Committee. At the end of 1986, 26 Kuwaiti dinar bonds were listed, and foreigners were permitted to sell and buy these bonds in the Exchange. Gold The monetary authorities and merchants registered with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry may import and export gold in any form, provided that such gold is not less than 18-karat fine; gold jewelry may not be imported or sold unless it is properly hallmarked. Kuwaiti nationals may free ly, and without license, purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. Other residents may, on arrival or departure, carry their holdings of gold in any form, without restriction or license. Jewelry and precious metals in any form, manufactured or unmanu- factured, are subject to an import du ty of 4 percent. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments May 22. Tariffs on certain iron and steel building materials were reinstated. May. Trade and economic agreements were signed with the People's Republic of China (May 25), Italy (May 3), Jordan (May 2), and Thailand (May 25). The Jordanian agreement calls for the gradual elimination of tariffs on some items over a period of five years, and the immediate elimination of tariffs on other goods. 305 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Lao People's Democratic Republic is the Kip (KN). On December 31, 1987 the official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar quoted by the State Bank of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (the central bank) was KN 10 = US$1; this rate is used only for customs valuation, certain other accounting purposes, and local expenditures related to projects financed by multilateral lending institutions. An exchange rate of KN 95 per US$1 applies to the surrender of foreign exchange to the budget and budgetary allocations of foreign exchange as well as the accounting of foreign aid disbursements in the budget. An exchange rate of KN 350 per US$1 applies to local expenses of embassies and inward remittances, and the exchange rates of KN 370 per US$1 (buying) and KN 380 per US$1 (selling) apply to exports and imports by the societes mixtes and the prefecture of Vientiane. Transactions between state en- terprises and the Bank for Foreign Trade with respect to foreign exchange retained or purchased also take place at these exchange rates. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies' are also officially quoted, based on the cross rates for these currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk. Administration of Control The Lao Bank for Foreign Trade, a subsidiary of the central bank, handles all official foreign exchange trans- actions related to foreign trade and services. All other official transactions are handled by the National Bank, which also administers exchange controls. Most foreign trade has been nationalized, and applications for imports through official channels must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Finance. The Societe du Commerce Lao (SCL) carries out most of the actual trade transactions and collects a commission on each export or import transaction. The amount of commission is negotiated. The SCL directly distributes the imported commodities and pays the import taxes. It values merchandise received under foreign aid at the domestic sale price of the product; import taxes on aid imports are levied on 80 percent of this price. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements is imposed on receipts or payments, but in principle, the central bank provides and accepts only deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, Thai baht, and U.S. dollars. The Lao People's Democratic Republic has bilateral trading arrangements with Bulgaria, Czecho- slovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, 1 Deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and Thai baht. 306 Democratic Kampuchea, Mongolia, Poland, the U.S.S.R., and Viet Nam. These are multiyear trading arrangements and are implemented through annual protocols containing payments arrangements, with annual limits on the deficits that Laos can incur for transactions with the partner countries; the deficits are in principle to be settled by means of trade transactions within six months from the end of the year of occurrence of the deficit; in some cases, however, such deficits may be converted into long- term loans. Imports and Import Payments All imports are a state monopoly, with the exception of imports made by the societes mixtes and authorized state enterprises with their retained foreign exchange earnings. An annual import plan is formulated by the Department of Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Com- merce, based on requests furnished by each government ministry, province, and state enterprise. In general, prior- ity is given to the import of spare parts, raw materials, machinery, and basic commodities, including rice. The import program is reviewed and revised every three months during the fiscal year. An allocation of foreign exchange to a state enterprise lapses at the end of the year if it is not utilized; state enterprises may modify their import requirements during the year, subject to the approval of the Planning Committee. Settlement for im- ports must be channeled through the Lao Bank for Foreign Trade. Payments for Invisibles There is a foreign exchange budget detailing the Gov- ernmen t's payments in foreign exchange during the fiscal year. Payments for all other invisibles are subject to prior authorization by the Ministry of Finance. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports are predominantly conducted by the public sector, which has a monopoly on strategic goods.2 Only the SCL, provincial trading companies, and specially authorized public enterprises can export these goods. A decree issued on October 19, 1987 stipulates that the export of logs is to be progressively reduced and that graded wood must be processed before exportation. Exports of gold and silver are prohibited, except when made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. Export taxes are levied at rates ranging between 3 percent and 40 percent, depending on the commodity.3 State enter- prises normally must surrender their foreign exchange earnings to the central bank, but in some cases enterprises 2 Coffee, tobacco, cardamom, benzoin, stick lac, processed wood, rattan, cattle, wild animals, minerals, and other special goods. 3 W i th effect from January 1, 1988, export taxes have been reduced or eliminated. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution are authorized to retain a specified proportion of their foreign exchange earnings in a special account at this bank; funds in such special accounts can then be used by the enterprise to import machinery and spare parts, as well as to cover certain prescribed operational expenses in foreign exchange. These amounts are not included in the annual import plan. A similar provision holds for provincial governments. The societes mixtes purchase most of their foreign exchange from the banking system. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the National Bank. Capital There is no foreign investment code. All outward capital transactions are prohibited. LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC Gold Residents may buy and sell gold within the country but may not take it abroad except by authorization of the Lao Bank for Foreign Trade. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement September 1. Within the existing range, the number of multiple exchange rates was reduced. Administration of Control October 19. The commission collected by SCL on each export or import transaction, previously fixed at 2 percent of the c.i.f. value of each transaction, became negotiable. Exports and Export Proceeds October 19. Exports of unprocessed gnarled wood were banned. 307 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution LEBANON (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Lebanon is the Lebanese Pound. The authorities do not maintain margins in respect of foreign exchange transactions, and exchange rates are determined largely on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary in order to maintain orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market. On December 31, 1987 the rate for the U.S. dollar was LL 455 per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The calculation of duties and taxes on goods and services on amounts invoiced or expressed in foreign currencies is based on an exchange rate of US$1 = LL 6. Prescription of Currency No restrictions are imposed on exchange payments abroad or receipts in Lebanon. Some transactions with Poland, with which Lebanon has a bilateral payments agreement, may be made through specific accounts de- nominated in U.S. dollars. Imports and Import Payments Imports of a few goods (mainly arms and ammunition, narcotics, and similar products) are either prohibited or reserved for the Government. All imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Imports of wheat and wheat derivatives, as well as of certain agricultural products that are produced locally, are either prohibited year- round or during a specified period of the year. Imports prohibited year-round include wheat, which, in principle, may be imported only by the Government, and citrus fruits, apples, olives (excluding olives in cans weighing less than 2 kilograms), olive oil, and peanuts; imports prohibited at certain times include squash, eggplant, green beans, watermelons, peas, peaches, and apricots. The Government has a monopoly over petroleum imports. Imports of certain other agricultural products and all seeds require a license. Import licenses are also required for certain finished goods, sanitary ceramic wares, and insulated electric and telephone wires, and cables made of copper. All other commodities may be imported freely without a license. Foreign exchange to pay for imports may be obtained freely. Banks are obliged to ensure that importers are in possession of a valid import license, if required, before issuing letters of credit. A prior deposit in a local currency amount equivalent to 15 percent of the value of import letters of credit must be placed by importers with their banks; such deposits are not required to be deposited by the banks with the Bank of Lebanon. A municipality tax of 3.5 percent is levied on the value of all goods imported, except those originating in an Arab country. A stamp tax is applicable to all imports, except 308 gold and bank notes, at the rate of LL 3 per thousand of the value of goods. The tariff regime is based on the Brussels Tariff Nomenclature. Ad valorem duty rates on most products range from 18 percent to 90 percent, and are applied on a most-favored-nation basis, except for certain imports from member countries of the European Economic Community (EEC) and Arab countries that are subject to a preferential rate. A few products are subject to a specific duty. A surcharge of 10 percent of the applicable import duty is levied on specified textiles and garments. Surcharges are also levied on motor vehicles, imitation jewelry, watches, and alcoholic beverages. The rates of surcharge on motor vehicles are as follows: 40 percent for vehicles with values of up to LL 10,000; 90 percent for vehicles with values between LL 20,000 and LL 30,000; and 150 percent for vehicles with values exceeding LL 30,000. The rate of surcharge on watches and imitation jewelry is 7 percent. The rate of surcharge on alcoholic beverages is: beer, LL 140 per 100 liter; champagne, 60 percent of the value; wine and arak, 20 percent of the value; and whisky, 30 percent of the value. An additional construction tax of 11 percent and a municipality tax plus an internal tax ranging from LL 2.5 to LL 9.5 per liter are also imposed on champagne, wine, liqueurs, and whiskey. A tax of 60 percent is imposed on other beverages. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments for invisibles. Foreign exchange may be obtained in the free market. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of certain goods (mainly arms and ammunition, narcotics, and similar products) to any destination and all exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Exports of wheat and wheat derivatives to any country, and all exports to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea require a license. Foreign exchange receipts from exports may be retained, used, or sold in the free market. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles may be retained, used, or sold in the free market. Capital There are no limitations on capital payments or receipts. Foreign exchange may be obtained or sold in the free market. Banks are permitted to pay interest on non- resident-held deposits denominated in Lebanese pounds. However, banks are required to hold reserves with the Bank of Lebanon equal to 100 percent of the amount of the deposits. Banks are prohibited from receiving depos- its, or opening accounts in Lebanese pounds, for nonres- ident banks and financial institutions. Banks are also prohibited from extending credit in Lebanese pounds to ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution LEBANON nonresidents. Bank credit in Lebanese pounds to residents for the purchase of foreign exchange for purposes other than foreign trade transactions is subject to a special reserve requirement; the required reserve amounts to 40 percent of Lebanese pound loans that directly give rise to foreign currency deposits and 15 percent of foreign currency deposits directly arising from Lebanese pound loans to depositors. Banks are authorized to maintain net foreign currency positions up to 15 percent of the amount of their own capital. Under a "free zone" banking facility, the commercial banks are exempt from reserve require- ments and fees for deposit insurance in respect of foreign currency deposits. Nonresidents are exempt from the 10 percent tax on interest earnings from foreign currency deposits. Under a National Investment Insurance Scheme, new foreign investments are insured against losses arising from noncivil risks, including war. Compensation is paid on losses exceeding 10 percent of the insured value. Gold Residents may freely hold gold in any form at home or abroad and may freely negotiate gold in any form with residents and nonresidents at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form are freely permitted and do not require a license but must be officially recorded. The import, export, and domestic sale of foreign gold coin must be covered by a certificate indicating the gold content and weight, issued by the Office for the Protection of the Consumer. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 309 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution LESOTHO (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Lesotho is the Loti (plural maloti), which is pegged to the South African rand at M 1 = R 1. Under the Common Monetary Area (CMA) agreement, the rand is also legal tender in Lesotho. The principal intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. On Decem- ber 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were US$0.52150 and US$0.52050, respectively, per M 1. Subject to certain limitations, authorized dealers are permitted to conduct forward exchange operations. The South African Reserve Bank provides forward cover; for private sector transactions, such cover is given to authorized dealers based on the middle spot rate adjusted by a percentage factor announced from time to time. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. A dual exchange rate system (discon- tinued in February 1983) was reintroduced in September 1985. Under the system, local sales proceeds of CMA securities and other investments owned by non-CMA residents cannot be transferred in foreign currency, but must be retained in the form of "financial rand" balances. Such balances are transferable among nonresidents at a freely determined exchange rate. On August 2, 1986 the scope for investment of the "financial rand," which initially was restricted to quoted securities of manufac- turing enterprises, was broadened to cover unquoted securities, the establishment of new companies, and the acquisition of property. Exchange Control Territory Lesotho forms part of the CMA, which is an exchange control territory comprising Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland. The amended Trilateral Monetary Agreement among these three countries became effective on April 1, 1986. No restrictions are applied to payments within the CMA; these are uncontrolled and unrecorded. In relation to countries outside the CMA, Lesotho applies exchange controls that are largely similar to those of South Africa and Swaziland. Administration of Control The Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL) controls external currency transactions. Authority to approve certain types of current payments is delegated to commercial banks up to established limits. Lesotho's trade licensing arrange- ments are designed mainly to raise revenue and to prevent tax evasion; permits are issued by the Ministry of Com- merce and Industry. Licenses for financial institutions and insurance agents are issued by the Central Bank of Lesotho. Imports and Import Payments Lesotho is a member of a customs union with Botswana, South Africa, and Swaziland, and there are no restrictions 310 on imports originating in any country of the customs union. Imports from countries outside the customs union are usually licensed in conformity with South Africa's import regulations; Lesotho reserves the right to restrict certain imports. Import permits are valid for all countries and entitle the holder to buy the foreign exchange required to make payments for imports from outside the customs union. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports are subject to licensing for revenue purposes; this requirement, in practice, is restricted to the export of diamonds. Most exports are shipped without license to or through South Africa. Unless otherwise permitted, all export proceeds must be remitted to Le- sotho and surrendered w i th in six months from the date of the export transaction. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments to nonresidents for current transactions, although subject to control, are not normally restricted. Authority to approve some types of current payments has been delegated to authorized dealers up to established limits. The basic annual exchange allowance for tourist travel to neighboring countries outside the CMA region— Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe —is M 4,000 an adult and M 2,000 a child; the corresponding annual allowance for tourist travel to other countries is M 10,000 and M 5,000. For business travel to neighboring countries, the basic annual allowance is M 8,000 a person at rates not exceeding M 600 a day; the corresponding limits for business travel to other countries are M 15,000 and M 750, respectively. A higher basic allowance may be obtained for business and medical travel. Emigrant allowances may be transferred through the financial rand market, up to M 100,000 a family or up to M 50,000 a person. Capital Inward capital transfers should be properly documented in order to facilitate the subsequent repatriation of inter- est, dividends, profits, and other income. No person may borrow foreign currency or register shares in the name of a nonresident, or act as a nominee for a nonresident, without prior approval. Applications for outward transfers of capital are con- sidered on their merits. The rulings on applications for inward and outward capital transfers may depend on whe ther the applicant is a temporarily resident foreign national, a nonres iden t, or a resident.

Not for Redistribution LIBERIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Liberia is the Liberian Dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar at $1 = US$1. There is no official intervention. U.S. currency is legal tender in Liberia and circulates along with Liberian coinage.1 There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements are in force. Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea- Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Imports and Import Payments Arrears are maintained with respect to import and other external payments. There is no general system of import control, but the importation of some items is subject to licensing and quantitative restrictions administered by the Ministry of Commerce, Indus t ry, and Transportation and the National Investment Commission to protect local indus try. These items include exercise books and note pads, liquefied bleaches, PVC pipes, toilet tissues, bottled carbonated drinks, portland cement, and liquefied petro- leum gas. A few items (e.g., arms and ammun i t ion, explosives) require prior licenses. In addition, imports of certain goods (e.g., narcotics other than for medicinal purposes) and all imports from South Africa are prohib- ited. Petroleum is imported by the Liberia Petroleum Refining Company (LPRC). In May 1987 a regulation was enacted that withdrew the privilege previously granted to mining, rubber, and logging companies to import petro- leum for their own use. Rice is imported primarily by private distributors. Licenses to import rice are issued to private distributors by the Ministry of Commerce and Indus try. A user fee of 10 percent is levied on a range of imports. Preshipment inspection of imports is required to as- certain the country of origin, the qua l i ty, the quan t i ty, and the value of all goods to be exported to Liberia. Both final and intermediate goods are subject to inspection, except for imports with an f .o .b. value of less than $3,000. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited.

Licenses are generally issued freely, and no licenses are required for direct exports by foreign concession holders; licenses serve mainly to enforce taxation or, for agricultural products, to assure certification of quality and origin and to safe- guard the export monopoly of the LPMC. In October 1987 a regulation requiring that wood products exported must have a local processing content of at least 25 percent was enacted, but it has not yet been enforced. Exporters must surrender 25 percent of export proceeds, including any other arrangement that may already exist between exporters and the Government for the offshore payment of some of their obligations to the Governmen t, to the National Bank of Liberia through the commercial banks. The Government and the National Bank of Liberia receive priority for the purchase of this foreign exchange. That portion of the foreign exchange surrender that is not purchased by the public sector is then made available to commercial banks at par. An export tax at the rate of 15 percent per troy ounce is levied on diamonds. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles There are no governmental limitations on payments for or receipts from invisibles. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or paymen ts by residents or nonresidents, other than a limit of $1,000 a person on capital export in the form of cash. Under an Inves tment Incentive Code of 1966 (as amended in 1973), enterprises undertaking new inves tment projects may be granted a five-year, 90 percent du ty exemption on imports of raw materials and machinery, total tax exemption on reinvested profits, a 50 percent exemption on distributable profits, and a protective tariff on competing imported products. The five-year incen t ive may be renewed for a fu r ther two years in certain circumstances. Gold Residents may freely and w i thout license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form are subject to licenses issued by the Ministry of Land, Mines, and Energy; import licenses are issued free ly, but export licenses are granted restrictively.

Margins not exceeding 7.25 percent are allowed around this fixed relationship, and the dinar has been depreciated to the maximum extent permitted within those margins to LD 1.00 = SDR 2.60465. Buying and selling rates of the Libyan dinar in terms of 17 currencies1 are based on their exchange rates vis-a-vis the SDR, as communicated by the IMF. The middle rate for the U.S. dollar, the inter- vention currency, as of the end of December 31, 1987 was LD 0.272962 = US$1. The Central Bank of Libya deals with commercial banks only in pounds sterling and U.S. dollars. The commercial banks are permitted to buy or sell other currencies against pounds sterling and U.S. dollars through their foreign correspondents. The banks may not deal among themselves in foreign currencies. Neither authorized banks nor importers or exporters are allowed to enter into forward commitments in foreign currencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank, which has delegated some of its powers to the authorized banks. Policy relating to imports and exports is determined by the Popular Congresses and executed by the General People's Committee for the Economy and Light Industry. Prescription of Currency Settlements with other countries are made in convert- ible currencies, usually U.S. dollars or pounds sterling, but payments for Libyan oil exports are not accepted in U.S. dollars. All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts A nonresident, as defined by the Central Bank, who is gainfully employed in the country is permitted under the exchange control regulations to open and maintain a nonresident account in Libyan dinars with any authorized bank. Legitimate earnings of such nonresidents can be credited to their nonresident accounts. Similarly, autho- rized banks have authority to credit interest earned on savings balances in these nonresident accounts. All other credits to nonresident accounts require the prior approval 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Lebanese pounds, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Tunisian dinars, and U.S. dollars. 314 of the Central Bank. (For debits of such accounts, see section on Payments for Invisibles, below.) Funds brought in by nonresident contractors undertak- ing contracts in their own names are required to be kept with an authorized bank. Payments received by contrac- tors in respect of their contracts may also be credited to these accounts. Remittances from these accounts are subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank after submission of the prescribed evidence bu t, in general, remittance is permitted up to the net-of-tax amount specified in the contract. Non-resident-owned capital that is not permitted to be transferred abroad is credited to blocked accounts. With the approval of the Central Bank, funds in blocked accounts (with certain exceptions) may be used for expenditures in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya up to LD 500 a year to cover the cost of visits by the owner of the funds or a close relative; for payment of legal fees, taxes, etc.; for remittances to the owner of the funds in his country of permanent residence (up to LD 1,000 in a calendar year); and for remittances in cases of hardship. When the funds have been in a blocked account for five years, they qualify, upon payment of due taxes, for remittance in full to the owner in his country of permanent residence. The blocked accounts of persons (with certain exceptions) who have left the country permanently are being released in installments; balances credited prior to March 31, 1966 have been released. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Imports included in the annual Commodity Budget are undertaken exclusively by state-owned enterprises with- out license. Importers are required to deal directly with producers abroad and not through intermediaries. How- ever, imports not included in the Commodity Budget are subject to licensing. Resident and nonresident firms un- dertaking development projects may import needed items that are not included in the annual Commodity Budget and not available locally. There is a prohibited import list, consisting mainly of consumer and luxury goods.2 Only government agencies may act as commercial agents, including import agents, for foreign companies. A state-owned company controlled by the Central Bank has a monopoly over the import of gold and precious metals. With certain exceptions, all exchange permits require central bank approval. Exchange permits required for imports are readily granted by the authorized banks following central bank approval, provided that there is a 2 These include mineral water, fru it juices, instant tea, certain types of coffee, green vegetables, poultry, preserved meats and vegetables, alco- holic beverages, peanu ts, fresh f ru i t, oriental rugs, soaps, envelopes, crystal chandeliers, toy guns, luxu ry cars, and fu rs. ©International Monetary Fund.

However, no letter of credit in respect of the import of consumer durable goods may be opened by an authorized bank w i thout a required cash margin based on the import price. Importers must present to the bank granting the exchange permit, w i th in two months of customs clearance, a customs declaration confirming clearance and stating the valuation. The ap- proval of the Exchange Control Department of the Central Bank is required for all paymen ts by residents. Imports are subject to customs duties and customs surcharges, the latter consisting of 10 percent of the applicable customs du ty. All Tunisian products and cer- tain Moroccan products are exempt from du t ies. Payments for Invisibles Remittances from nonresident accounts maintained by nonresident workers and technicians may be approved by authorized banks up to limits specified below: (1) nonresidents employed by the state, state-owned enter- prises, and foreign companies may remit up to 50 percent of their net salaries each mon th if their contracts do not specify that lodging, board, or both will be made available free of charge by the employer, or up to 75 percent of net salary if their contracts specify that both lodging and board at worksites in remote areas will be made available free of charge by the employer in accordance with applicable Libyan laws and regulations; (2) nonresidents employed by the Libyan private sector may remit up to 50 percent of their net salaries, provided that the mon th ly net remittance does not exceed LD 40 for agricultural and unskilled workers, and LD 60 for technical workers. In general, nonresidents may not transfer income derived from overtime work. In addition to limits on transfers, there is an upper limit of LD 400 on the value of goods that nonresidents going abroad permanently can take; the value in excess of this allowance is deducted from the transferable portion of earnings. Staff of United Nations agencies, embassies, consulates, and medical institutions are exempt from these regulations. Banks may issue traveler's checks and foreign currency notes to nonresi- dent workers and technicians w i th in the limits mentioned. Residents leaving for personal travel abroad, including tourist travel, may, in addition, take out foreign exchange in the form of foreign currency notes, traveler's checks, and letters of credit not exceeding a total value of LD 300 (LD 150 for children under 12) in a calendar year as a basic travel allowance; the exchange may be obtained from any authorized bank in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Additional amounts may be granted in special circum- stances. Pilgrims are entitled to a special quota. Tem- porary residents may take out any traveler's checks or foreign currency notes that they had previously brought in and declared to customs. Travelers from the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya may not take out Libyan currency. SOCIALIST PEOPLE'S LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA All other payments for invisibles, as well as payments in excess of the approval authority delegated to the banks, require prior approval of the Central Bank. Applications are considered on their merits. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required only for fish, raw wool, hides and skins, and for agricultural products. Export proceeds must be received through an authorized bank within six mon ths of shipment. Exports of nonmonetary gold (other than for processing abroad), vegetable oils, and scrap metals are prohibited; exports or re-exports of wheat, wheat flour, crushed wheat, barley, rice, tea, sugar, tomato paste, and macaroni, which are subsidized commodities, are also prohibited. All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Proceeds from Invisibles All foreign exchange receipts must be surrendered. Traveler's checks or foreign currency notes may be encashed only at an authorized bank, an exchange office, or a hotel licensed by the Central Bank. Travelers entering the country may bring with them traveler's checks, letters of credit, securities, coupons, and other negotiable instruments in unlimited amounts; these must be declared to customs. Foreign exchange converted into Libyan dinars by visiting tourists may be reconverted upon departure, with the exception of a m in imum local expenditure of US$50 for each day spent in the country. Capital Under the provisions of Foreign Capital Investment Law No. 37 of July 31, 1968, foreign capital invested in projects deemed to contribute to the economic develop- ment of the coun try, as well as profits thereon, may be transferred freely to the country of origin, provided that the paid-up capital is not less than LD 200,000 and that at least 51 percent of the shares are held by foreign nationals. Salaries of foreign staff employed on such projects may be transferred on the basis described above in the section under Payments for Invisibles. Central bank approval is required and customarily granted freely for all such transfers. Foreign participation in industrial ventures set up after March 20, 1970 is permitted on a minority basis, but only if it leads to increased production in excess of local requirements, introduction of the latest technology, and cooperation with foreign firms in ex- porting the surplus production. Insurance companies and foreign shareholdings in banks have been nationalized. Commercial firms have been Libyanized in varying de- grees, and 51 percent or more of the Libyan interests of the international oil companies have been nationalized. Real estate may be owned in Libyan Arab Jamahiriya only by Libyans. Non-resident-owned capital that is not permitted to be transferred abroad is credited to blocked accounts (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above). Residents require the prior approval of the Central Bank to borrow funds abroad. As a rule, residents must have 315 ©International Monetary Fund.

The Central Bank imports processed and unprocessed gold and precious metals; it also sells gold in bars to domestic goldsmiths for manu- facture at prices announced from time to time. The gold is processed before it may be sold to the public. Unworked gold is subject to an import duty of 15 percent. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 316 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MADAGASCAR (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Madagascar is the Malagasy Franc. The exchange rate for the Malagasy franc is managed flexibly with reference to a basket of several currencies. The weight assigned to each currency in the basket is based on the distribution of Madagascar's trade during 1973-80. There is no single intervention currency, al- though the majority of transactions take place in French francs and U.S. dollars. In accordance with the movement in the basket, the Central Bank of Madagascar adjusts the Malagasy franc exchange rates on a daily basis against ten currencies1 which it quotes. The authorized banks are not permitted to maintain an exchange position in any foreign currency, although they may hold trade bills as foreign assets. There are no taxes or subsidies on pur- chases or sales of foreign exchange. On December 31, 1987 the midpoint rate for the U.S. dollar quoted by the Central Bank of Madagascar was FMG 1,234.27 = US$1. Administration of Control All countries other than Madagascar are considered foreign countries, and financial relations with all foreign countries are subject to exchange control. Exchange control is administered by the Exchange Control Office of the Directorate of the Treasury, which also supervises borrowing and lending abroad by residents, the issue, sale, or introduction of foreign securities in Madagascar, all outward inves tmen ts, and inward direct inves tmen t. Some of the approval authority for exchange control has been delegated to authorized intermediaries, and all ex- change transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through such intermediaries. Import licenses are issued by the Directorate of Imports in the Ministry of Commerce. With the exception of a few traditional prod- ucts, exports may be made freely. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Payments and receipts must be effected through the authorized intermediaries, which may deal with the Cen- tral Bank in any of the quoted currencies. A bilateral payments agreement is maintained with Mauritius. Nonresident Accounts The principal type of nonresident account is the Foreign Account in Malagasy Francs. Such accounts may be debited and credited only for transactions between non- residents and for explicitly authorized transactions be- tween residents and nonresidents. When Malagasy francs accruing to a nonresident are not eligible for credit to a Foreign Account, they must be credited to a Special 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. Blocked Account, balances in which may be used by the holder for personal expenses in Madagascar, subject to a limit of FMG 20,000 a day for the account holder and FMG 10,000 a day for each accompanying family member. Any other operation requires the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance and Economy. Imports and Import Payments Importers require the approval of the Ministry of Commerce before they are permitted to engage in import activities. All imports are subject to an annual import program, the overall value of which is determined by the Ministries of Finance and Economy, Commerce, and Indus try, and the Central Bank. The import of certain items, including alcoholic beverages, rice, and wheat flour, is reserved for the Regie Malgache des Monopoles Fiscaux and the government-owned agricultural trading f irm, SINPA. All import transactions valued at FMG 10,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank. However, these transactions are conducted by the authorized banks in accordance with the financing terms agreed between the Central Bank and the authorized banks. Under a new liberalized import system (LIR), which came into effect on January 2, 1987, foreign exchange allocations are set aside on a monthly basis for imports of spare parts, raw materials, small equipment goods, and nonfood consumer goods. Importers of these goods must file an application with the Ministry of Commerce not later than the third working day of each month and pay a flat-rate nonre- fundab le fee of 5 percent of the value of the application. In the event that the total amount of applications does not exceed the monthly amount of foreign exchange allocated, the subsequent foreign exchange authorization is issued for the full amount requested; otherwise, the amounts applied for are reduced proportionately, and on a nondiscriminatory basis, to the overall monthly allo- cation. The foreign exchange authorizations are issued to the applicants on the fifteenth working day of the same month. Foreign exchange authorizations may be accu- mulated for a period of one year from the date of issue. On the basis of the foreign exchange authorized, importers are granted import licenses, which are valid for one year from the date of delivery of the license. There are two exceptions to the system described above. First, for imports financed directly by foreign loans, applications for licenses are approved up to the full amount of the financing available, and the license fee of 5 percent is applied on the amount of the license issued. Second, exporters of goods and services—other than exporters of coffee, vanilla, cloves, and sugar —may benefit from a special import regime. Enterprises whose exports of goods and services exceed 50 percent of their annual turnover are authorized to import their total requirements of raw materials, spare parts, and small 317 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MADAGASCAR equipment goods without paying the 5 percent fee. En- terprises whose exports are less than 50 percent of their turnover are authorized to import their inputs without paying the 5 percent fee only to the extent that they are used exclusively for the production destined for export and are imported under the temporary admission regime; imports of inputs not entering into exports do not benefit from this special system and are treated on an equal footing with all the imports under the LIR system. The special system for exporting enterprises is imple- mented for a transitional period and is subject to a global ceiling of SDR 25 million in 1987, regardless of the sources of financing. Once this allocation is exhausted, exporting enterprises must use the LIR system to import their inputs .2 Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance and Economy, which has delegated approval authority to the Directorate of the Treasury and to authorized intermediaries, either up to specified limits or for any amount that is properly docu- mented. Residents may purchase foreign exchange for tourism subject to an annual limit of FMG 180,000 a person a year (FMG 90,000 for children under 10 years). Any foreign exchange remaining after re turn to Mada- gascar must be surrendered. For business travel, foreign exchange may be purchased up to the equivalent of FMG 75,000 a person a day, subject to a maximum of FMG 1,125,000 a trip for up to two trips a year. Authorized banks may not sell foreign bank notes in excess of the equivalent of FMG 20,000 a person a trip for tourist or business travel. Applications for additional amounts and applications for exchange for any other type of travel must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and Econ- omy. Applications for additional foreign exchange may be approved for bona fide business trips and for medical treatment abroad, but not for tourism. Allocations for different types of travel may not be combined without the prior approval of the Directorate of the Treasury. There are limits for educational expenses and certain other current invisibles. Dividends are transferable in full when distributed by industrial firms and up to 75 percent in other cases; they may be transferred only to nonresident physical or juridical persons of foreign nationality. The transfer of savings from wages and salaries earned by a foreigner working in Madagascar is permitted, upon presentation of his work contract and employment permit, provided that the transfer takes place w i th in three months of the pay period. The amounts allowed are up to 25 percent of the net salary for bachelors and persons whose families are in Madagascar, and up to 45 percent for those whose families live outside Madagascar (100 percent for both categories during leave spent outside Madagascar); in all cases, the transferable amount may not exceed FMG 600,000 a person a month. 2 An open licensing system (OGL) was introduced for raw materials and spare parts on February 1, 1988; it is expected to be introduced for inves tment goods on May 1, 1988, and for all goods on Ju ly 1, 1988. 318 Resident and nonresident travelers to foreign countries may take out up to FMG 5,000 in Malagasy bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out any remaining foreign bank notes and coin and other foreign means of payment declared by them on en t ry. Exports and Export Proceeds With the exception of certain important commodities such as coffee, cloves, and vanilla, all exports may be made freely. However, the exporting enterprises must obtain an exporter's card (carte d'exportate>ur) issued by the M in is try of Commerce and file an export declaration with this M in is t ry .3 Export proceeds received in foreign currencies must be surrendered; such proceeds normally become due not later than three mon ths after shipment of the goods, unless the M in is try of Finance and Economy (Directorate of the Treasury) waives this requirement. All commercial export transactions valued at FMG 50,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized interme- diary, and the exporter must sign a commitment to repatriate the foreign currency proceeds within 30 days after arrival of the goods at their destination .4 Proceeds from Invisibles All amoun ts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income or proceeds accruing in those countries or from nonresidents, must be repa- triated w i th in one mon th of the due date. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of means of payment denominated in a foreign currency and up to FMG 5,000 in Malagasy bank notes. Capital Capital movemen ts between Madagascar and foreign countries and between residents and nonresidents are subject to prior authorization by the Ministry of Finance and Economy. Special controls are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward inve s tmen t, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Madagascar. Foreign direct inves tmen ts in Madagascar5 require prior approval of the M in is ter of Finance and Economy (the Directorate of the Treasury). Malagasy direct investments abroad6 are subject to prior authorization from the Min- istry of Finance and Economy.

Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company. Any transfer of a nonresident's participation in the capital of a company in Madagascar is subject to the prior autho- rization of the Ministry of Finance and Economy. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Madagascar requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Economy. Exempt from authorization are operations in connection with shares similar to securities whose issue, offering, or sale in Madagascar has previously been authorized. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Economy, although loans contracted by authorized banks or credit institutions with special legal status are exempt. Lending abroad is subject to authori- zation by the Ministry of Finance and Economy. In accordance with the Investment Code of June 18, 1985 (Law No. 85-001), foreign or domestic enterprises of special importance to the economy may be granted preferred status arrangements. Such enterprises may benefit from specified advantages relating to import duties, income taxes, import licenses, and other financial and economic benefits. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Madagascar. Imports and exports of gold require prior authorization by the Ministry of Commerce after review by the Directorate of Industry and Mines. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports MADAGASCAR by or on behalf of the Central Bank; and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quan- tity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Travelers are authorized to export 50 grams or 250 carats of gold jewelry or gold articles a person, and 50 grams or 250 carats of numismatic items a person. Imports of gold, whether licensed or exempt from license, are subject to customs declaration. Newly mined gold must be sur- rendered to the Directorate of Industry and Mines, which, in principle, must deliver it to the Central Bank after processing.

Not for Redistribution MALAWI (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Malawi is the Malawi Kwacha, which is pegged to a basket of currencies based on the geograph- ical composition of Malawi's trade and the invoicing currencies in Malawi's foreign exchange transactions. The middle rate of the Malawi kwacha for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, quoted by the Reserve Bank of Malawi is determined on the basis of the daily calcu- lations of the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar in terms of the SDR. On December 31, 1987 the Reserve Bank's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were MK 2.0488 and MK 2.0640, respectively, per US$1. The Reserve Bank also quotes buying and selling rates for the Canadian dollar, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Japanese yen, the pound sterling, the South African rand, the Swiss franc, the Zambian kwacha, and the Zimbabwe dollar, which are determined on the basis of the appropriate daily cross rates as communicated by the International Monetary Fund. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank under authority delegated to it by the Minister of Finance. Import policy is formulated by the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Tourism (MTIT), which also is responsible for the issuance of import and export licenses. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments.1 Prescription of Currency Payments to nonresidents may be made in Malawi kwacha to the credit of a nonresident account maintained by the recipient or in any convertible foreign currency2 traded in Malawi. Payments from residents of other countries may be received in Malawi kwacha from a nonresident account or in any convertible foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in Malawi kwacha held by residents of other countries are designated nonresident accounts. These accounts may be credited with the proceeds from sales of any convertible foreign currency, with authorized payments in Malawi kwacha to foreign countries by Malawian residents, and with transfers from other non- resident accounts. Balances on these accounts may be used to make payments to residents of Malawi for any purpose and may be transferred freely to other nonresident accounts; these accounts may also be debited for pay- ments to the account holder while he is temporarily resident in Malawi. 1 These arrears were settled January 1988. 2 Under Malawi's exchange control regulations, all currencies other than the Malawi kwacha are considered foreign currencies. 320 Blocked Accounts in Malawi kwacha are held with authorized banks by residents of any country other than Malawi. All debits and credits to such accounts require the prior authorization of the exchange control authorities. Normally, authorization is given for the investment of balances of Blocked Accounts in an approved manner. On application to the exchange control authorities, the interest on Blocked Account balances is normally trans- ferable to the account holder's country of residence. Imports and Import Payments The allocation of foreign exchange for imports is based on an annual foreign exchange budget. Most imports are subject to the open general licensing system. However, for a number of items,3 specific import licenses are required from the MTIT. Goods originating in Common- wealth countries or in non-Commonwealth countries that are members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) may be imported under an open general license. Imports monitored most closely, and for which licensing procedures are strictest, are salt, fertilizer, second-hand clothing, and cement. Specific import licen- ses are usually issued within a week of application, and are normally valid for a period of six months. Prior to placing an import order, importers must obtain foreign exchange approval by filing with a commercial bank an application for foreign exchange, accompanied by pro forma invoices, including, where necessary, a specific import license. In principle, commercial banks are authorized to approve foreign exchange up to MK 100 without reference to the Reserve Bank; however, as a matter of practice, commercial banks refer all foreign exchange applications to the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank allocates foreign exchange on the basis of an annual foreign exchange budget and according to guidelines regarding the priority of imports. Essential goods such as raw materials, spare parts, petroleum products, machinery, chemicals (including pharmaceuti- cals and fertilizers), and certain basic foodstuffs are given high priority. Nonessential items, such as luxury con- sumer items and goods for which import substitutes are available, are given low priority. This application process normally takes about one mon th. When approved goods arrive in the country and pay- ments are due, the importer must make a further appli- cation for foreign currency payments. Such applications must be accompanied by relevant customs documents. Commercial banks may require counterpart deposits de- pending on means of payment (e.g., letter of credit); but 3 Certain agricultural and food products, new (military type) and used clothing, gold, sugar, wheat flour, cement, fertilizers, newsprint and certain paper products, pencils, ball-point pens, office s tap l ing .mach ines and staples, pr in t ing inks, erasers, hand-operated numbe r ing stamps, flick kn ive s, explosives, arms and ammun i t ion, game traps, mist nets, wild animals, live fish, cassava, and copyright articles. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution this is a matter of banking practice and is not required by official regulations. The Reserve Bank authorizes payment after ascertaining the bona fides of the exchange application. The normal period needed to complete the administrative procedures is about one month. Any prepayment for imports is prohibited, except w i th the permission of the exchange control authorities. Pay- ments against sight letters of credit and sight bills of exchange are not permitted. Imports may be paid for in Malawi currency to an appropriate local nonresident account or in any convertible currency. Duty payable on imports is calculated based on a composite rate which consists of import levy (fixed at 10 percent), surtax (up to 35 percent), and customs du ty (up to 75 percent), depending on the tariff classification of imports. The composite rate is 100.4 percent on average. Payments for Invisibles Exchange to pay for invisibles related to imports requires prior approval of the exchange control authori- ties. For other purposes such as traveling abroad, foreign exchange is provided up to certain limits by authorized dealers without prior reference to the exchange control authorities. The basic exchange allowance for private travel is MK 20 a day for an adult, with a max imum of MK 600 a calendar year. For children up to 10 years of age, the basic exchange allowance is MK 200; for children over 10 years up to 18 years, the allowance is MK 300 a year. Annual allowances are not cumulative but may be increased by up to 50 percent if the traveler has not applied for a travel allowance during the preceding three years. Allocations are subject to a combined max imum of MK 2,000 a year for a family traveling together. The basic exchange allowance for business travel is up to MK 400 a trip for any number of trips a year. Exchange is provided, subject to certain limits, for other purposes such as education, medical treatment, and fam i ly remit- tances. Applications for amounts exceeding the standard allocations must be referred to the exchange control authorities. Foreign nationals employed in Malawi on contracts and holding a temporary employment permit are allowed to remit up to two thirds of their current net earnings to their country of normal residence. Travelers may take out up to MK 20 in Malawi currency and £ 10 or US$15 in bank notes, or the equivalent of £ 10 or US$15 in any other convertible currency notes, in addition to their basic travel allowance. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of goods of any description that exceed MK 100 in value are not allowed, unless the Controller of Customs and Excise is satisfied that payment has been made or will be made in an appropriate manner to a resident of Malawi not later than five working days after payment for exports is made. Certain commodities4 are 4 Imp lemen ts of war, petroleum produc ts, nickel, atomic energy ma- terials, and certain agricultural and animal products. MALAWI subject to export licensing, mainly to ensure the adequacy of domestic supplies. Export proceeds in foreign currency must be sold to an authorized dealer. Export proceeds must be surrendered not later than five working days after payment has been made to the exporter's account in a foreign bank. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in any foreign currency must be sold to an authorized dealer. There is no limitation on the amount of foreign currency notes and coin that may be imported by travelers, but not more than MK 20 in Malawi currency notes and coin may be imported. Capital Inward transfers of capital are not restricted, with the exception that the taking up of loans from abroad by residents requires prior exchange control approval, which is normally granted, provided that the terms of repayment, including the servicing costs, are acceptable. Outward transfers of capital are controlled, but nonresidents are permitted to repatriate their investments when they have satisfied the authorities that the original investment was made with funds brought into the country; there are no restrictions on the transfer abroad of dividends and profits of foreign-owned companies, provided that no recourse is being made to local borrowing to finance the transfer. Residents may not purchase any foreign securities w i thout specific exchange control approval. In general, residents are not permitted to transfer capital abroad and, with certain exceptions, they are required to offer for sale to an authorized dealer any foreign exchange that accrues to them. Residents require prior approval to lend to nonresidents or to resident firms controlled directly or indirectly from outside Malawi. Approval to lend to non- resident-controlled firms may be withheld if it is felt there is excessive recourse to local borrowing and that a firm has brought in insufficient working capital from abroad. All applications for emigrants' allowances must be submitted to the exchange control authorities for ap- proval: (1) persons 50 years of age and over are allowed exchange equivalent up to MK 15,000, whether single or married; (2) married persons under 50 are allowed MK 6,000 on departure, together with MK 500 for each child, up to a maximum of MK 8,000 for a family; (3) unmarried persons under 50 years of age are allowed MK 3,000 on departure; (4) the balance of the emigrant's funds is blocked, but on the anniversary of the departure date from Malawi, a sum equal to the original emigration allowance is permitted to be transferred to the new country of residence, up to a maximum of MK 8,000. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Malawi for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and au- thorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold at home or abroad in any form other than jewelry. Imports of gold in any form other than jewelry require 321 ©International Monetary Fund.

The rate of import levy was raised from 5 percent to 10 percent. MALAWI licenses issued by the Minister of Trade and Industry in consultation with the Ministry of Finance; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports by or on behalf of the monetary authonties and industnal users. Ch D ri 1987 Exchange Arrangement February 7. The kwacha was depreciated by 20 percent against its currency basket, resulting in a change in the 322 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALAYSIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Malaysia is the Ringgit. The external value of the ringgit is determined on the basis of its relationship to a basket of currencies weighted in terms of Malaysia's major trading partners and the .currenc ies of settlement. The exchange rate of the ringgit in terms of the U.S. dollar, the in terven t ion currency, is deter- mined in the foreign exchange marke t, and the Central Bank of Malaysia intervenes only to moderate volatile daily fluctuations in the value of the ringgit in relation to the basket of currencies. Rates for all other currencies are determined on the basis of the ringgit-U.S. dollar rate and the U.S. dollar rates for those currencies in markets abroad. On December 31, 1987 the middle rate for the U.S. dollar was M$2.4915 = US$1. The commercial banks are free to determine and quote exchange rates for all currencies, other than Israeli and South African cur- rencies, to customers. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Commercial banks are permitted to deal forward in all currencies other than Israeli and South African currencies, and are free to determine the rates. Forward exchange contracts may be in respect of both commercial or financial transactions. Forward cover for the commercial banks is provided usually for up to three months for purchases and sales. In the official facility, forward premia and discounts are roughly equal to those that the commercial banks charge their customers. Malaysia formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from November 11, 1968. Administration of Control The Central Bank administers exchange control throughout Malaysia on behalf of the Malaysian Govern- ment, the Governor of the Bank being the Controller of Foreign Exchange. Most of the authority for approving payments abroad is delegated to authorized banks. The authority for import control rests with the Royal Customs and Excise Department of the Federal Ministry of Fi- nance. The day-to-day administration of import licensing throughout Malaysia is carried out jo in t ly by the Ministry of Trade and Industry and other specified authorities, such as the Ministry of Primary Industries, Malaysian Timber Board, and the Veterinary Department, on behalf of the Royal Customs and Excise Department. Prescription of Currency All payments to countries other than Israel and South Africa may be made either in ringgit or in any currency other than Israeli and South African currencies. Receipts from exports to countries other than Israel and South Africa must be obtained according to the timing of payment specified in the commercial contract, but subject to a maximum period of six months from the date of exportation, either in any foreign currency except cur- rencies of Israel and South Africa, or in ringgit from an External Account. Special rules apply to settlements with Israel and South Africa. Nonresident Accounts The accounts in ringgit of residents of countries other than Malaysia are designated as External Accounts. There are no restrictions on debits to External Accounts. Credits to these accounts for whatever purpose are freely per- mitted, subject only to the completion of exchange control forms for amounts above M$l0,000. The proceeds from the sale of any foreign currency may be credited to External Accounts. For amounts exceeding M$ 10,000, permission may be given by authorized commercial banks. Balances in External Accounts may be transferred to any other account, whether resident or nonresident, and may be converted into any currency except Israeli and South African currencies. Accounts of residents of Israel and South Africa are designated as Israeli Accounts and South African Accounts, respectively. All debits and credits to such accounts require prior approval. Imports and Import Payments Tariffs and import controls of the various parts of Malaysia have been fu l ly unified. Depending on the nature and origin of the goods, import licenses are required for certain imports as specified in the Customs (Prohibition of Imports) Order 1987, for reasons of health, security, or public policy; various conditions must be satisfied before import licenses for such goods are issued. Certain other imports are subject to quantitative restrictions as a temporary measure to protect local industries. These restrictions are reviewed from time to time. Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Imports of all goods originating from the People's Republic of China are also subject to an import license. Imports of motor vehicles are subject to an import license with quantitative restrictions (quota). Movements of live animals between Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak are subject to movement permits issued by the Veterinary Department. Imports of meat, bones, hides, skin, hooves, horns, and offal of any animal or any portion thereof from India require an import license. Imports of primates require an import license, subject to approval from the Department of Wildlife and National Parks. Payments for permitted imports valued up to M$ 10,000 from any country other than Israel and South Africa may be made without restriction after exchange control re- quirements have been met. Payments in excess of M$10,000 require completion of forms and approval by any autho- rized commercial bank. Raw materials and machinery for the manufacturing sector are eligible for preferential duty treatment as 323 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALAYSIA follows: (1) raw materials not manufactured locally are subject to a reduced rate of import du ty of 2 percent; (2) industries can be further exempted from this 2 percent import duty if they comply with the New Economic Policy in terms of equity participation, management, and em- ployment structure; (3) in the case of companies manu- facturing finished products for the export market, fu ll exemption from import du ty is granted when local ma- terials are competitive in price and quantity; (4) all customs duties and sales tax on imported machinery and equipment that are unavailable locally and used in the manufacturing process can be considered for exemption; (5) import du ty drawback can be claimed by any manu- facturer, provided that evidence of export performance and importation of raw materials is submitted; and (6) equipment and materials used by patients with kidney illnesses are exempt from import duty and sales tax. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries other than Israel and South Africa may be made without restriction after exchange control requirements have been met. There is no restriction on the amount of foreign exchange made available for travel abroad. Remittances to nonresidents of dividends, royalties, and profits on all bona fide inves tmen ts are permitted, subject only to the completion of exchange control forms for amounts in excess of M$10,000. There is no restriction on the export of currency notes by travelers. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are totally prohib- ited. Exports of sawlogs above 40 centimeters in diameter from Peninsular Malaysia are prohibited. For sawlogs of 40 centimeters and below in diameter, only those species other than the 27 banned species are allowed to be exported. The customs areas and export control systems between the three territories of Malaysia have been harmonized. Exchange control forms have to be com- pleted for exports valued at more than M$20,000 f.o.b. a shipment (for exports to Indonesia, forms are not required except when exports are valued at more than M$ 100,000). No authorization is required for exports of commercial samples or goods sent for repair or exchange. Proceeds from exports must be received according to the timing of payments specified in the commercial contract, but subject to a maximum period of six months from the date of export, in any foreign currency except the currencies of Israel and South Africa, or in ringgit from an External Account. Exports of rubber from Peninsular Malaysia require a certificate issued by the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board. Exports of tiles, bricks, minerals, rice and paddy in whatever form, milk and specified milk products, textiles, and all other goods as specified in the second schedule of the Customs (Prohi- bition of Exports) Order 1978, of the 1967 Customs Act are subject to licensing. Export incentives are provided to companies exporting Malaysian products. The main incentives include abate- 324 ment of adjusted income for manufactured exports, an export allowance for agricultural products, double de- duction of expenses incurred in overseas promotion, export credit financing, and duty drawbacks. Proceeds from Invisibles The exchange control authorities do not regulate ex- change receipts from invisibles, but receipts from exports are subject to exchange control. No limitation is imposed on the import of currency notes by travelers. Capital Inward investment covered by the guidelines issued on February 20, 1974 (regarding the acquisition of assets, mergers, and takeovers) requires prior approval by the Foreign Inves tment Committee (FIC). The guidelines stipulate that the approval of the FIC is required for any acquisition of Malaysian assets or interests exceeding M$5 million in value. In respect of acquisition of equity interest in a Malaysian incorporated company, any pro- posed acquisition of 15 percent or more of the voting power by any foreign interest or associated group or by foreign interests in the aggregate of 30 percent or more, the approval of the FIC is still needed even if the value involved is less than M$5 million. However, incorporation of a Malaysian company by foreign interest does not require the approval of the FIC; any subsequent trans- action by the company that is covered by the guidelines, including increasing its paid-up capital, would need its approval. Foreign investors are permitted to hold whatever level of equity up to 100 percent if the company exports 80 percent or more of its production, whether or not the company's products compete with products presently being manufac tured locally for the domestic market. For projects that involve the extraction or exploitation of nonrenewable resources, majority foreign equity par- ticipation of up to 100 percent is permitted. In the determination of the percentage for these projects, criteria such as level of inves tmen t, technology, risk involved, availability of Malaysian expertise in the area of explo- ration, the degree of integration, and level of value added involved are taken into consideration. Foreign investors whose applications are received dur- ing the period of October 1, 1986-December 31, 1990 are also permitted to hold whatever level of equity up to 100 percent, if the company exports 50 percent or more of its production or employs 350 full-time Malaysian workers and the products do not compete with products presently being manufactured locally for the domestic market. Export sales are defined to include sales to free trade zones and licensed manufacturing warehouses. The proceeds of inves tmen ts may be repatriated freely on resale, subject to the completion of exchange control forms for amounts above M$ 10,000. Companies in Ma- laysia controlled by nonresidents are permitted to borrow in Malaysia up to M$10 million without exchange control approval, provided that total credit facilities obtained by the borrower in Malaysia do not exceed M$10 million, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution and that at least 60 percent of the borrower's total domestic credit facilities are obtained from commercial banks and other financial institutions incorporated in Malaysia. The permission of the Controller of Foreign Exchange is freely given for direct and portfolio invest- ments by Malaysian residents in countries other than Israel and South Africa, provided that they are not financed with domestic credit. If an investor has any domestic credit outstanding, such inves tmen ts require approval from the Central Bank. Commercial banks are not encouraged to give loans to finance inves tmen ts abroad that are considered unlikely to lead to long-term benefits for the economy; such funds should be used to finance the expansion of productive capacity in Malaysia. Commercial banks are permitted to have a long or a short foreign exchange position up to M$400,000 for each foreign currency without specific approval from the Con- troller of Foreign Exchange. Borrowing in foreign currencies from nonresidents may be made freely for loans of M$l million or less, provided that the total outstanding amount owed by the borrower to nonresidents, including undrawn facilities, does not exceed the equivalent of M$l million; beyond that amount, permission must be obtained from the Controller of Foreign Exchange, stating the main terms and conditions of the loan and the purpose for which the loan proceeds would be used. However, loans in foreign currencies in excess of the equivalent of M$200,000 and up to the equivalent of M$l million must be reported to the Con- troller of Foreign Exchange. Foreign borrowing in ringgit of any amount requires prior approval. Service paymen ts on approved foreign loans may be permitted by the commercial banks on behalf of the Controller, provided these payments are in accordance with the approved terms and conditions of the loans. Commercial banks and merchant banks in Malaysia can lend in foreign currency to residents and accept deposits in foreign currency from nonresidents. Loans in foreign currency by banks in Malaysia must be for business and productive purposes in Malaysia, including (but not exclusively) payment for the import of goods and services, payment of interest or repayment of principal on loans from nonresidents, or payment for the purchase from nonresidents of immovable properties in Malaysia or stocks and shares. In addition, for the purchase of property or shares (1) the FIC must give its approval; (2) the amount borrowed must not exceed the equivalent of M$25 million; and (3) repayment of principal cannot be made with funds borrowed in ringgit from residents. The approval of the Controller is required for all other foreign currency loans. As an incentive, interest paid to nonresidents by the commercial banks is exempted from payment of the 20 percent withholding tax. Intercompany accounts, which exclude proceeds from the export of Malaysian goods and proceeds from loans extended to Malaysian companies, can be maintained with associate companies outside Malaysia, provided monthly returns are submitted to the Controller. In addition, companies located in free trade zones, or those MALAYSIA that are licensed warehouses may, with prior permission from the Controller of Foreign Exchange, be allowed to offset their export proceeds through intercompany ac- counts against payables to their affiliated or parent com- panies overseas for the supply of raw materials and components. Gold Residents of Malaysia are freely permitted to deal (i.e., purchase, sell, import, export, borrow, etc.) in gold in whatever state or form with any person except residents of Israel and South Africa. Changes During 1987 Exports and Exports Proceeds January 1. The following measures were introduced: (1) export documents must be filed for shipments valued at more than M$20,000 f.o.b.; previously, forms had to be completed if the shipment exceeded M$5,000; (2) authorization is not required for exports of commercial samples or goods sent for repair or exchange (previously, exchange control authorization was required for all ex- ports not giving rise to payments); (3) payments for exports may be received in any foreign currency sold to an authorized bank, except the currencies of Israel and South Africa, or in ringgit from an External Account (previously, payment had to be received in one of the 19 specified currencies, or in ringgit from the sale of foreign currencies to a bank in Malaysia); and (4) exporters are no longer required to obtain bank certification in respect of export receipts for each shipment; instead, a single audited report on export receipts may be filed on a quarterly basis with the Controller of Foreign Exchange. Capital January 1. Authorization for borrowing in foreign currency from nonresidents was required only when the loan exceeds the equivalent of M$l million, or when the total outstanding amount owed by the borrower to non- residents, including undrawn facilities, exceeds the equiv- alent of M$l million. However, loans in excess of the equivalent of M$200,000 must be reported to the Con- troller of Foreign Exchange; foreign borrowing in ringgit of any amount requires the prior approval of the Controller of Foreign Exchange. (Previously, authorization was required for loans in foreign currency or in ringgit of the equivalent of M$100,000, or more.) Specific permission was no longer required by non-resident-controlled com- panies to borrow domestically up to M$10 million, pro- vided that total credit facilities obtained by the borrower in Malaysia do not exceed M$10 million, and that at least 60 percent of the borrower's total domestic credit facilities are obtained from commercial banks and other financial institutions incorporated in Malaysia; previously, per- mission was required for domestic borrowing in excess of M$500,000. Gold January I. The public was permitted to deal freely in gold of any form or weight, without obtaining prior 325 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALAYSIA approval; previously, approval was required for holding and transacting in gold bars and wafers weighing more than 100 grams each. Dealings in gold with residents of Israel and South Africa, however, continue to require the approval of the Controller of Foreign Exchange. 326 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALDIVES (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Maldives is the Maldivian Rufiyaa. Since March 1, 1987 the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) has followed a floating exchange rate policy under which the exchange rate has been determined by demand and supply conditions in the market. The midpoint ex- change rate of the rufiyaa in terms of the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1987 was Rf 9.3950 = US$1. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk in the official or the commercial banking sector. Administration of Control There is no exchange control legislation. Trade regu- lations are administered by the Ministry of Trade and Industries, which also issues import and export licenses. Prescription of Currency Since March 1, 1987 all settlement of tourism bills must be made in foreign currency. There are no restrictions on maintaining balances in foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents; and there are no restrictions on keeping foreign currency balances. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Import licenses are issued to importers who are in possession of import licenses on the basis of the value of their imports in 1985. All licenses are subject to review every four months in the light of foreign exchange flows into the country. Import operations may be conducted only after being registered and licensed at the Ministry of Trade and Industries. Staple commodities (such as rice, wheat, flour, sugar), medicines, and part of the country's requirement of petroleum products are imported by the State Trading Organization. Ad valorem import duties are calculated on the c.i.f. value of imports. Duty rates on daily necessities and essentials range from 5 to 30 percent, and those on luxuries and items that are not essential for economic development range from 35 to 200 percent. Some items imported for personal use are ex- empted from du ty. Payments for Invisibles Travelers may freely take out any amount in domestic or foreign currency without any restrictions. Tourist resorts, hotels, and guest houses must pay their taxes and rent in foreign exchange. Exports and Export Proceeds Export operations may be conducted only after being registered and licensed at the Ministry of Trade and Industries. Exports of black coral and tortoise shells are prohibited, except in the form of a product. An export du ty is levied on ambergris exported by a Maldivian, goods exported by a Maldivian jo in t ly with a foreigner, and goods exported by a foreigner; re-exports are exempt. Exporters of dutiable goods are required to import goods or foreign exchange equal to the value of the goods exported, within the time period specified in the license. In the case of duty-free exports, other than fish caught outside the 75-mile zone from the shore line, exporters may, at the request of the Government, be required to import specified goods in an amount not exceeding 33 percent of the value of the goods exported; this requirement has, however, not been applied to date. Proceeds from Invisibles Private sector receipts from current invisibles need not be surrendered and may be disposed of freely through the foreign exchange market. Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign currency without restriction. Capital Residents and nonresidents may freely import and export capital through the foreign exchange market, and residents do not require permission to maintain foreign currency accounts at home or abroad. Inward direct investment requires approval. All foreign investors are required to provide at least 75 percent of their capital investment either in the form of cash or in capital goods financed from outside Maldives. Transfers of profits are permitted, and exemptions from taxes other than tourism may be granted for a period of up to ten years. Gold Transactions in gold are not subject to regulation. Residents may freely hold and negotiate gold in any form, at home or abroad, and the import and export of gold are not restricted. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement March 1. The external value of the rufiyaa was allowed to float freely and be determined by demand and supply conditions in the market. The exchange rate of the rufiyaa would be published by the MMA from time to time. Prescription of Currency March 1. All domestic transactions were required to be made in domestic currency. Payments made by non- residents to tourist resorts, hotels, and guest houses, however, were required to be made in foreign currency. Imports and Import Payments March 1. The system of granting import licenses to importers who obtain foreign exchange financing from the banking system was abolished. 327 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALDIVES Payments for Invisibles March 1. All resorts, hotels, and guest houses were required to settle their taxes and rents in foreign exchange. 328 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALI (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mali is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange rates for all other currencies that are officially quoted on the Paris exchange market are based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the Paris exchange market rate for the currency concerned. The BCEAO levies commissions of 0.1 per mill and 2.5 per mill, respectively, on transfers to or from nonmembers of the West African Monetary Union (WAMU). The banks also charge a separate commission, a portion of which is transferred to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Forward exchange rate cover is authorized only for import payments to be effected through documentary credits, and cover for other means of import payments require the prior authorization of the Minister of Finance and Commerce. There are no official schemes for currency swaps or a guaranteed exchange rate for external debt servicing. With the exception of measures relating to the repatri- ation of export proceeds, Mali's exchange controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Ca- meroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Com- oros, Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control The Minister of Finance and Commerce has sole au- thority in exchange control matters; certain exchange control powers have been delegated to the BCEAO and to authorized banks. The bilateral paymen ts agreement accounts2 are operated by the Development Bank of Mali. Licenses for imports and exports are issued by the Directorate-General of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance and Commerce. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Settlements on account of transactions covered by bilateral payments agreements are made in currencies and through accounts established under such agreements. 1 The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de I'Afr ique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2 Mali maintains bilateral paymen ts agreements w i th the People's Republic of China, Hungary, Morocco, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and Viet Nam. With the exception of those with the People's Republic of China and the U.S.S.R., these agreements are inoperative. Since Mali has an Operations Account with the French Treasury, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other member of the French Franc Area. Settlements with all other coun- tries with which no payments agreement is in force are usually made through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Settlements with The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Li- beria, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are, in principle, based on those applied in France. The crediting to nonresident accounts of CFA banks notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury is not permitted, except for BCEAO bank notes mailed directly to the BCEAO Agency in Bamako by foreign correspondents of the authorized banks; such notes may be credited to Foreign Accounts in Francs opened by these correspondents with an au- thorized bank in Mali. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited without prior authorization with BCEAO bank notes mailed directly by authorized intermediaries to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments The revised trade regulations introduced in 1986 estab- lish three categories of imports: (1) imports admitted freely and requiring only an import certificate (Regime A); (2) imports subject to quotas and requiring an import license (Regime B); and (3) imports subject to special prohibitions for reasons of security, public health, etc. (Regime C). Imports originating in a member country of the West African Economic Community (WAEC) are subject to Regime A; some products from EC (European Communities) countries, such as foodstuffs and other basic necessities, are also included in Regime A. Other products from the EC countries, such as luxury consumer goods and products that compete with local production, are subject to quotas under Regime B, as are all com- modities from all other countries. Imports financed di- rectly from foreign resources, for example, from grants, foreign investment, or development loans, are admitted virtually freely under Regime A. Imports from Israel, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and South Africa are prohibited. Imports are licensed in accordance with an annual import program. A license is valid for six months bu t, if necessary, may be extended for a fur ther period of three months. However, the system is implemented flexibly, 329 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALI and licenses in excess of the program are issued for justified need or unforeseen circumstances. Imports may be made by either private importers or state enterprises, among the most important of which is the Societe Mal- ienne d'Import-Export (SoMiEx). An allocation commis- sion establishes quotas for each private importer on the basis of his turnover. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and roy- alties are subject to approval. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account may obtain an annual exchange allocation equivalent to CFAF 250,000 a person (CFAF 125,000 for children under 10 years), which may be used on several occasions during the year; any unused foreign exchange must be surren- dered to an authorized intermediary within eight days after the return to Mali. For business travel, the allocation is the equivalent of CFAF 25,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 250,000 a trip.3 Residents traveling to foreign countries may take out up to CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, or the equivalent in Bank of France bank notes, or bank notes issued by other countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account. Nonresident travelers may freely take out foreign bank notes up to the equivalent of CFAF 100,000; higher amounts may be taken out only if declared upon en try. They may also take out CFAF 50,000 in BCEAO bank notes, or the equivalent in Bank of France bank notes, or bank notes issued by other countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account, and any payments ins trumen ts drawn up abroad in their name. The transfer of the entire salary of a foreigner working in Mali is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period or where there is a reciprocity agreement with the foreigner's country of nationality. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to foreign countries must be recorded with an authorized bank, and all export proceeds, including those 3 Exchange for tourist travel purposes is made available only to persons submitting an exit permit (automation de sortie) issued by the Security Services. 330 originating in France and other countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account, must be repatriated and surrendered within one month of payment due date or within 90 days from shipment if no payment date is specified in the sales contract. All exports require only a certificate. The exportation of cereals is prohibited. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other coun- tries for services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Capital Capital movements between Mali, France (as defined above), Monaco, and the countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account are free of restric- tions; capital transfers to all other countries require authorization from the Ministry of Finance and Commerce and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (in addition to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, although the Development Bank of Mali is exempt from these controls. The special control measures also do not apply to relations with France (as defined above) and the countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account. Under the Investment Code of January 24, 1986, the Government may grant special privileged status, providing for transfer, tax, and other preferential treatment to foreign inves tmen ts that would be of special interest to the Malian economy and that are compatible with the goals of the Economic Plan. Gold Travelers may export gold jewelry and personal be- longings, other than gold coin and ingots, up to a maximum weight of 500 grams. Commercial imports and exports of gold do not require authorization by the Ministry of Finance and Commerce but are subject to customs dec- laration as prescribed by the customs regulations. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALTA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Malta is the Maltese Lira. The value of the Maltese lira is determined on the basis of the fixed relationship between the Maltese lira and a transactions- weighted basket of currencies' representing Malta's im- portant trading partners. The daily exchange rate between the Maltese lira and the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is derived by adding up the latest dollar values of the currency components of the Maltese lira basket; the midday quotations in Hong Kong are normally used in the computations. In dealings with the commercial banks, a spread of 0.125 percent is applied between the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar and for the various other currencies quoted by the Central Bank. On December 31, 1987 the buy ing and selling rates for the Maltese lira in terms of the U.S. dollar in such dealings were US$3.2156 and US$3.2076, respectively, per Lm 1. The Central Bank also quotes daily rates for various other currencies, including the deutsche mark, the Italian lira, and the pound sterling, on the basis of the rate for the U.S. dollar and the cross rates for these currencies in the principal exchange markets abroad. The Central Bank's basic rate (middle rate) for the pound sterling on December 31, 1987 was £ stg. 1.7147 per Lm 1. The commercial banks' rates for currencies not quoted by the Central Bank are based on the latest market rates as reported by Reuters. These rates are treated as provisional, and are quoted on request. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The commercial banks are obliged to cover with the Central Bank any forward contracts entered into with their customers in the principal currencies. Any forward contract concluded between a bank and a customer must be accompanied by a similar contract between the bank and the Central Bank. The forward facilities offered by the Central Bank to the commercial banks are intended to provide cover for firm contractual comm i tmen ts for current transactions —i.e., payments and receipts per- taining to merchandise trade and other invisible trans- actions. Capital transactions are excluded. The Central Bank assumes all the exchange risk entailed in its forward contracts with the commercial banks. The Central Bank also provides forward cover directly to government de- partments and various parastatal bodies in respect of imports. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Central Bank, as agent for the Minister of Finance; trade controls are administered by the Director of Trade in the Ministry for Development of the Tertiary Sector. The approval 1 Belgian francs, deutsche ma rk, French francs, Japanese yen, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, and SDKs. authority for the allocation of foreign exchange for certain purposes has been delegated to the authorized banks, which also may give or renew guarantees for any purpose, provided they hold full cash cover in Maltese liri or foreign currency for the period of the guarantee. Prescription of Currency Authorized payments to all countries may be made by crediting Maltese liri to an External Account or in any foreign currency;2 the proceeds of exports to all countries may be received in Maltese liri from an External Account or in any foreign currency. Bilateral trade and payments agreements are maintained with a number of countries.3 Outstanding balances under these agreements can be settled in convertible currencies. Nonresident Accounts Residents of all countries outside Malta may maintain with authorized banks nonresident accounts in Maltese liri, designated External Accounts. These accounts may be credited freely with authorized payments to nonresi- dents, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of gold or any foreign currency (including bank notes). External Accounts may be debited freely for payments to residents, for transfers to other External Accounts, for payments in cash in Malta, and for purchases of any foreign currency (includ- ing bank notes). Authorized dealers may freely open and maintain For- eign Currency Accounts for nonresidents. These accounts may be credited with payments in foreign currency to the account holder, with transfers from another foreign cur- rency account belonging to a nonresident, and with interest payable on Foreign Currency Accounts. They may be debited for payments by the account holder to residents, for transfers to other Foreign Currency Ac- counts, and for transfers abroad. Subject to exchange control permission, companies controlled by nonresidents or residents may maintain Foreign Currency Accounts in Malta or abroad. Imports and Import Payments Imports of all commodities are, in principle, subject to licensing requirements. Imports from Japan are restricted, with the exception of industrial supplies, spare parts for products already in Malta, and imports not available from elsewhere. The importation, in finished form, of certain goods that can be produced domestically is restricted; this restriction covers more than 60 different products, mostly leather goods, textile goods, and meat products. 2 Foreign currencies are defined as all currencies other than the Maltese lira. 3 As of December 31, 1987, Malta maintained bilateral paymen ts agreements w i th Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Poland, and Turkey. 331 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALTA Certain imports are subject to state trading. These include commodities, such as evaporated tinned milk, butter, meat, wheat, barley, corn, potatoes, soybean oil, sugar, certain tinned meat and fish, cheese, tea, f ru i t, and cement. Payments for all authorized imports may be made freely, provided that the prescription of currency regulations are complied with and that supporting documents, including the customs entry form and the related import license, are submitted to the intermediary bank. As a form of exchange cover, and subject to exchange control ap- proval, residents may keep Foreign Currency Accounts to settle import payments; on the same basis, import payments may also be offset against export proceeds. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require the approval of the exchange control authorities, but approval authority for most types of payment has been delegated to authorized banks. In any calendar year each person is entitled to a travel allowance of Lm 500 for one trip and Lm 250 for additional trips, subject to a limit of five trips. The allowances are for trips of at least six nights' duration; otherwise, they are reduced pro rata. Persons traveling abroad and returning within the same day are allowed not more than Lm 30, subject to not more than three trips in addition to the five trips referred to above. Business travelers are allowed an exchange allocation equivalent to Lm 100 a day per person, subject to a limit of Lm 2,000 a trip and one such trip every 30 days. Frequent business travelers may obtain a blanket six- month authorization with actual expenses reconciled every six months or upon exhaustion of the funds au- thorized. Expenses (other than air or sea fares) defrayed in advance in Malta in connection with overseas trips are counted as part of the foreign exchange allowance. Re- quests beyond the specified limits require the exceptional consideration of the Central Bank. The allowance for educational expenses abroad is the equivalent of Lm 3,000 a person for an academic year.4 Applications for allow- ances in excess of these amounts are approved by the Central Bank if it is satisfied that no illicit capital outflow is involved. Nonresident travelers may import any amount of foreign currency and may export foreign currency up to the amount brought in by them and declared to customs on entry. The transfer of profits, dividends, and interest from approved foreign investments requires central bank per- mission, which is normally given, after compliance with certain formalities. Life insurance expressed in Malta currency may be contracted only with insurance com- panies that are duly licensed as required under the Insurance Business Act, 1981. Remittances for the main- tenance of dependents abroad are allowed on application showing evidence of hardship. 4 For purposes of exchange allocations for travel and s tudy, residents are defined as physical persons who are at the time living in Malta and either have lived there for at least three years or intend to continue living there for at least three years. 332 Up to Lm 25 in Maltese notes and coins may be exported by a traveler. Exports and Export Proceeds With the exception of works of art and certain essential goods, all commodities may be exported freely. However, certain textile products for export to EC (European Communities) countries, Norway, and Sweden are subject to license. The proceeds of exports must be received and surrendered within six months of shipment. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. Travelers may bring in any amount in foreign currency notes, bu t, without an authorization by the Minister of Finance, importation of any notes and coin that are or have been legal tender in Malta is permitted only up to Lm 50. Capital No control is exercised over capital receipts, although receipts in foreign currencies must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. Payments abroad of a capital nature require prior approval. Applications for outward direct investment by residents and for direct investment in Malta by nonresidents are considered on their merits. The Immovable Property (Acquisition by Nonresidents) Act, 1974, administered by the Ministry of Finance, prohibits the acquisition of immovable property in Malta by non- residents,5 with the exception of certain special cases mainly related to economic development. Applications for the acquisition of property for use as a residence by individuals who do not already hold property in Malta are given favorable consideration. Purchases of personal real estate situated outside Malta require prior exchange control approval. Foreign nationals who take up residence outside Malta normally are allowed to transfer all their assets to their new country of residence. Maltese nationals who emigrate may transfer abroad up to the equivalent of Lm 7,500 for each family; any excess amount is normally released three years after the date of departure on application to the Central Bank. Banks, other than those licensed to borrow and lend only outside Malta, are restricted in the acqui- sition of net foreign assets. Gold Malta has issued 23 denominations of gold coin, which are legal tender. Residents are allowed to hold coin and to acquire jewelry, but they require exchange control permission to purchase and sell any gold coin that is not 5 For the purposes of th is Ac t, the term nonresidents means (1) individuals who are not residents of Malta; and (2) any association of persons, or any en t i ty, whe ther corporate or not, if (a) it is registered outside Malta, (b) it has its principal place of residence or bus iness outside Malta, (c) 20 percent or more of its shares or other capital is owned by a nonresident person, or (d) it is in any manner, whe ther directly or indirectly, controlled by one or more nonresident persons. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALTA legal tender. The import of gold coins is controlled to ensure that such coins are genuinely for numismatic purposes. A specific import license is required for imports of gold coin, gold bullion, and manufactured or semi- manufactured articles of gold; imports of filigree work of gold or silver are prohibited. Subject to exchange control permission, authorized importers may import gold bullion only to supply jewelers and other industrial users. The export of gold by residents other than the monetary authorities also requires exchange control permission. Gold bullion and gold coin are free of import du ty. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement November 26. The SDR was included in the currency basket. Capital November 26. The prohibition on transfers of funds to religious missions abroad and on transfers of foreign portfolio investments from a resident company to a resident private individual, and vice versa, was removed. 333 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAURITANIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mauritania is the Mauritanian Ouguiya. The exchange rate for the ouguiya is determined on the basis of a basket of currencies comprising the Belgian franc, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta, and the U.S. dollar. The relative weights assigned to these currencies are based on the currencies' relative importance in Mauritania's total ex- change transactions and are revised from time to time. The opening spot rates of the currencies in the basket against the U.S. dollar on the Paris exchange market are used for determining the ouguiya's daily exchange rate vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. Daily exchange rates for 16 other currencies,1 including the currencies used in the basket, are obtained from the daily reference rate for the U.S. dollar and the cross rates for these currencies in the Paris exchange market. On December 31, 1987 the mid- point exchange rate of the ouguiya in terms of the U.S. dollar was UM 71.60 = US$1. Commissions of 0.75 percent are applied in respect of purchase and sale transactions through commercial bank accounts, and commissions of 1.25 percent are applied in respect of purchase and sale transactions involving trav- eler's checks and foreign currencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce. The Central Bank has delegated to authorized banks power to conduct transactions through convertible ouguiya accounts that have been approved by the Central Bank. The Central Bank is authorized to obtain any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks or, in some cases, through the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses, where required, are issued by the Foreign Trade Department in the Ministry of Commerce. All import licenses require exchange control approval by the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. Settlements with other countries usually take place in convertible currencies. Nonresident Accounts There are two kinds of nonresident accounts in domestic currency: Convertible Accounts, which may be credited 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, CFA francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Moroccan dirhams, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 334 only with proceeds from the sale of foreign currency or transfers from other Convertible Accounts; and Internal Nonresident Accounts, which may be credited with do- mestic bank notes. Convertible Accounts may be debited for any payment without central bank approval, but payments and withdrawals from these accounts may not be made in foreign bank notes without special approval from the Central Bank. The facility of Convertible Ac- counts is extended to exporters in the fishery sector and shipowners whose products are subject to the marketing monopoly vested in the Mauritanian Fish Marketing Company; they may credit the accounts with up to 15 percent of repatriated export earnings and debit them for payment of expenses relating to export production activities. Nonresidents may open foreign currency ac- counts on the same terms as those applying to accounts in convertible ouguiyas. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited, and imports of a few goods are prohibited for reasons of health or public policy. Only holders of importer-exporter cards are permitted to engage in import transactions. Imports of all commodities must be authorized by the Central Bank. The National Import-Export Corporation (SONIMEX) has a monopoly over imports of sugar, rice, and green tea. Although there is no formal import program, an annual import program is established on the basis of projected foreign exchange receipts, and import autho- rization is granted w i th in the framework of this program. Import transactions must be domiciled with an autho- rized bank, except in the case of imports "without payment." After the approval of the Central Bank has been obtained, the import license entitles the importer to purchase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than ten days before shipment if a documentary credit is opened or eight days before the payment is due if the commodities have already arrived. Advance payments for imports require prior approval of the Central Bank. The Central Bank authorizes only the payment of import bills quoting c. & f. prices, and all imports must be insured with the Mauritanian State Insurance and Reinsurance Company (SMAR). There are special arrangements for imports in border areas. Payments for Invisibles Payments to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Payments for invisibles to other countries are subject to the approval of the Central Bank, which has delegated its approval authority for certain specified payments to authorized banks. Basic exchange allocations have been established for various types of invisibles. For tourist travel, residents may obtain an annual exchange allocation equivalent to UM 10,000 a person (UM 5,000 for children under 10 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution years). For business travel, the allocations are the equiv- alent of UM 50,000 a person a trip to African countries, UM 90,000 to Europe, and UM 120,000 to other desti- nations; annual limits range from UM 100,000 to UM 800,000, depending on the applicant's business turn- over. Bona fide requests for higher amounts for travel may be granted on a case-by-case basis. The use of all travel allocations must be marked in a personal travel exchange booklet. The transfer of savings from salaries by foreigners working in Mauritania is permitted up to varying percentages, according to marital status. At the end of their stay in Mauritania, they may transfer all their assets abroad. Travelers are not allowed to take out domestic bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Only holders of importer-exporter cards are permitted to engage in export transactions. Export transactions to all countries in excess of UM 5,000 must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Exporters must sign an undertaking to repatriate and surrender foreign exchange proceeds. Exporters in the fishery sector are authorized to retain up to 15 percent of export proceeds in a convertible ouguiya account with a Mauritanian bank, and balances are allowed to be used for payments relating to production activities. Exports to all countries require authorization and endorsement by the Central Bank. Export proceeds must be surrendered not later than the due date of the receipt, which normally must not be more than 60 days after the date of shipment. Exports of iron ore are the monopoly of the National Industrial and Mining Company (SNIM), and exports of demersal fish are the monopoly of the Mauritanian Fish Marketing Company (SMCP). A special repatriation requirement applies to the export proceeds of SNIM. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles must be sur- rendered. All amounts due from nonresidents in respect of services and all income earned abroad from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered within four months of the due date of the payment. The importation of domestic bank notes by travelers is prohibited. Capital Transfers of capital between Mauritania and Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between Mauritania and all foreign countries are subject to ex- change control; capital transfers to all countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts normally are permitted freely, although the sub- sequent investment of the funds in Mauritania may require approval, as indicated below. MAURITANIA All investments abroad by residents require prior au- thorization by the Central Bank. Foreign direct invest- ments in Mauritania2 and Mauritanian direct investments abroad3 must be declared to the Central Bank before they are made. The Central Bank has the right to request the postponement of the projects within 15 days from receipt of the declaration. The full or partial liquidation of inward or outward investment also requires a declaration. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether Mauritanian investments abroad or foreign investments in Mauritania, must be reported to the Central Bank within 20 days following each operation. Direct invest- ments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not consid- ered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Mauritania requires prior authorization by the Central Bank, as does borrowing by residents from nonresidents. The Investment Code (Ordinance No. 79046 of March 15, 1979) provides for various benefits for private invest- ments in Mauritania and stipulates that profits and divi- dends accruing from such investment can be transferred freely. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Mauritania. All imports and exports of gold require prior authorization by the Central Bank. Exempt from this requirement are imports and exports by the Central Bank and manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Changes During 1987 Exports and Export Proceeds January 29. Domestic exporters of fisheries products and shipowners whose products are subject to the mar- keting monopoly vested in the Mauritanian Fish Marketing Company were authorized to retain up to 15 percent of repatriated export proceeds in a convertible ouguiya account with a local bank. Balances on this account may be used freely to make payments outside Mauritania to cover expenses directly relating to their production ac- tivities. The provisions applying to nonresident accounts would also apply to these accounts. 2 Including those made by companies in Mauritania that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Mauritania of foreign companies. 3 Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Mauritania and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Mauritania. 335 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAURITIUS (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mauritius is the Mauritian Rupee, the external value of which is determined on the basis of its relationship to a weighted basket of currencies of Mau- ritius' major trading partners. Buying and selling rates for foreign currencies are quoted by the Bank of Mauritius (central bank) with asymmetrical margins, amounting to 0.125 percent (buying) and 0.25 percent (selling) in respect of exchange transactions in pounds sterling and U.S. dollars, and 0.1875 percent (buying) and 0.25 percent (selling) in respect of exchange transactions in French francs, using rates obtained on the basis of the fixed peg to the basket of currencies. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates of the Bank of Mauritius were Mau Rs 22.5751 and Mau Rs 22.6599, respectively, per £ stg. 1; Mau Rs 12.1600 and Mau Rs 12.2057, respectively, per US$1; and Mau Rs 2.2454 and Mau Rs 2.2553, respectively, per F 1. Commercial banks are authorized to deal in the French franc, pound sterling, and the U.S. dollar at rates based on the rates quoted by the Bank of Mauritius for these currencies. Spreads allowed between buying and selling rates of the commercial banks for transactions by tele- graphic transfers are up to 1 percent for transactions in the pound sterling, 1.25 percent for the U.S. dollar, 1.6 percent for the French franc, 2.25 percent for the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, and 2.375 percent for the deutsche mark. Commercial banks' buy ing and selling rates for other foreign currencies1 are determined on the basis of appropriate cross rates in the London market and the cost of forward cover in appropriate cases. Forward exchange facilities in pounds sterling, French francs, and U.S. dollars are made available by the Bank of Mauritius for industries operating in the Export Pro- cessing Zone and for banks engaged in foreign borrowing for on-lending to the sugar sector. The max imum period for forward cover is six mon ths; the forward rates are based on a un iform margin of 3 percent per annum. In addition, companies operating in the export processing zone, and other Mauritian exporters and traders dealing in priority imports are authorized to engage in forward cover transactions in foreign exchange markets abroad through their bankers in Mauritius. Companies operating in the export processing zone and the service zone and certain other companies are authorized to maintain w i th local commercial banks accounts denominated in foreign currencies. They may retain the foreign currency proceeds from exports in foreign currency accounts for a reasonable period of time to meet paymen ts for their imports. A stamp du ty of 45 percent is applied to authorized outward transfers of capital (other than banking funds and repa- 1 The exchange control regulations of Mau r i t ius define foreign currencies as all currencies other than the Mau r i t ian rupee. 336 triation of approved foreign investments) and purchases of gold coin and gold bullion. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Mauritius under powers delegated to it by the Financial Secretary. Commercial banks, as agents of the Bank of Mauritius, are authorized to approve and effect payments for current transactions up to prescribed limits. Trans- actions in excess of authorized limits must be referred to the Bank of Mauritius for prior approval. The Ministry of Trade and Shipping is responsible for the issuance of import and export permits, where required. Prescription of Currency Beginning in 1985, Mauritius no longer makes a dis- tinction between sterling and nonsterling areas for pre- scription of currency purposes. Payments to nonresidents may be made in Mauritian rupees from a nonresident account or in any convertible foreign currency. Similarly, payments from nonresidents may be received in Mauritian rupees from a nonresident account or in any convertible foreign currency. A bilateral payments agreement is maintained with Madagascar. Nonresident Accounts External accounts may be opened by residents and firms of other countries and may be credited with (1) authorized paymen ts by residents of Mauritius, (2) any transfers from other external accounts, and (3) the pro- ceeds of sales to an authorized dealer of any convertible foreign currency by nonresidents. These accounts may be debited with (1) any payment to residents of Mauritius, (2) any transfers to other external accounts, and (3) the cost of purchase of any convertible foreign currency or gold. The ''Non-Resident (External Account) Scheme," reintroduced on September 25, 1985, is intended to provide Mauritians abroad with incentives to transfer their savings to Mauritius and to open accounts with commercial banks in Mauritius in rupees in the form of savings or fixed deposit accounts and in designated foreign currencies in the form of term deposits with a minimum period of one year. Interest on such deposits is exempted from income tax. As long as they are abroad, holders of such accounts are free to transfer at any time balances held therein, together with interest. Any related exchange risk involved in maintaining accounts in designated foreign currencies is borne by the Bank of Mauritius. In addition to the above, there are also Blocked Ac- counts to which are credited funds owned by persons and firms resident outside Mauritius and realized from in- vestments made by them prior to April 5, 1966, as well as funds representing emigrants' assets in excess of Mau Rs 100,000. Such accounts may be credited with payments by residents of Mauritius that have been spe- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution cifically authorized for credit to a Blocked Account and may be debited for certain specified transactions. Funds from Blocked Accounts may, with approval, be invested in Mauritius. Upon the realization of such investments, the proceeds are directed once more to a Blocked Account. Imports and Import Payments Importers must be licensed under the Licenses Ordi- nance. Under the Supplies (Control of Imports) Regula- tions of 1982, all imports other than goods exempted or prohibited, as specified in the third and fourth schedules, respectively, require import permits from the Ministry of Trade and Shipping; the permits are essentially for sta- tistical and tax purposes. Commercial banks are autho- rized to approve and transfer funds for import payments up to an amount not exceeding Mau Rs 200,000 without prior approval from the Central Bank. Certain imports are subject to customs surcharges; a stamp duty of 17 percent based on the c.i.f. value is levied on most imports. Local commercial banks are discouraged from extending credit for imports of goods of lower priority. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles related to imports exceeding Mau Rs 200,000 per transaction require the prior approval of the exchange control authorities. Foreign exchange for other purposes, such as foreign travel and gifts, may be provided up to specified limits by the commercial banks without prior reference to the exchange control authori- ties. The basic personal travel allowance is the equivalent of £ stg. 1,200 a person for every two calendar years for travel to any country. A 10 percent tax, together with a surcharge of 10 percent thereon, is levied on all air tickets purchased by Mauritian residents for international travel. The allowance for business travel is the equivalent of £ stg. 100 a day plus £ stg. 20 a day for entertainment expenses. There are established limits for payments and transfers in respect of family support, salary remittances by non-Mauritian nationals, gifts, trade commissions, subscriptions to clubs and societies, publishing rights, advertising outside Mauritius, royalties, professional and technical services, education, and leave salaries. Appli- cations for amounts exceeding the standard allocations may be submitted to the exchange control authorities. Resident and nonresident travelers may take out Mau Rs 350 in domestic currency. Resident travelers may take out foreign currency notes up to the amount of their travel allowance. Nonresident travelers may take out any foreign currency declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of (1) articles made wholly or partially of gold, platinum, or silver; (2) diamonds, precious and semipre- cious stones, pearls, and articles mounted with these; and (3) works of art are prohibited, unless permission is obtained from the Financial Secretary. All exports valued at more than Mau Rs 1,000 and all exports of food products valued at over Mau Rs 50 require an export permit from the Ministry of Trade and Shipping. Exports MAURITIUS of certain foodstuffs, including fruits, are controlled. The Mauritius Sugar Syndicate is the sole exporter of sugar. A graduated tax is levied on sugar exports at the rate of 15.75 percent of f.o.b. value for export volume within the range of 1,001-3,000 tons, and 23.625 percent for exports exceeding 3,000 tons. All export proceeds in any currency other than Mauritian rupees must be repatriated within six months after shipments and offered for sale to an authorized dealer. However, permission may be given to large export-import companies to retain export pro- ceeds for a reasonable period of time to meet payments for imports. Exports of knit shirts and sweaters of cotton, wool, and man-made fibers to Canada and the United States are effected under bilateral export restraint agreements. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in any currency other than Mauritian rupees must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer. There is no limitation on the amount of foreign currency notes and coin that may be imported, but not more than Mau Rs 700 in domestic currency notes and coin may be imported by travelers. Capital Inward transfers of capital are not restricted. Outward transfers of capital are subject to certain restrictions. Nonbank residents of Mauritius may, subject to permis- sion, transfer a reasonable amount of capital to any country on payment of a 45 percent stamp du ty. Nonres- idents also require permission to transfer capital to any country; such transfers are subject to a 35 percent stamp duty. Foreign-owned companies may freely transfer abroad dividends, profits, and interest on capital. Permission for repatriation of capital is not granted for capital brought in before April 5, 1966, irrespective of the country of origin. Proceeds from the sale, liquidation, etc. of foreign capital that may not be repatriated must be credited to Blocked Accounts. However, permission for repatriation of capital is normally given for capital brought in on or after April 5, 1966. Repatriation of capital by foreign investors is tax-free up to the amount of original invest- ment. Any capital gains are blocked. The blocked funds may, however, be released either for transfer abroad against payment of the 35 percent stamp du ty, or for investment in Mauritius without payment of stamp duty. Emigrants may take out, at the official rate of exchange and free of stamp duty, the equivalent of Mau Rs 100,000 from their Mauritian assets when emigrating to any country; this facility is available upon redesignation as a nonresident, which occurs upon departure. The balance of an emigrant's funds must be credited to a Blocked Account; any releases that may be approved for transfer abroad are subject to payment of the 45 percent stamp du ty. Persons emigrating from Mauritius are not entitled to draw their personal travel allowance in addition to the emigration facilities. 337 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAURITIUS Gold Residents other than the monetary authorities are permitted to hold gold for numismatic purposes (including commemorative gold coins of Mau Rs 200 and Mau Rs 1,000) or as personal jewelry and ornaments. The import and export of monetary gold are prohibited, except when made by the monetary authorities. Imports of gold for industrial purposes are subject to a specific import permit. Exports of articles made wholly or partially of gold, other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler, are prohibited. Payments in respect of private imports of gold coin and gold bullion are subject to the 45 percent stamp duty. Imports of certain jewelry are subject to temporary customs surcharges.

The tariff regime was reformed, and the max- imum tariff rate was reduced to 127 percent inclusive of stamp duties. 338 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MEXICO (Position on December 37, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mexico is the Mexican Peso. There are two exchange markets: the controlled market and the free market. The exchange rate in the controlled market is adjusted daily on the basis, inter alia, of the following factors: (1) the demand and supply of foreign exchange in the controlled market; (2) the objective regarding an adequate level of international reserves; (3) the movement of domestic and foreign prices; and (4) movements in other exchange rate relationships. Transactions at the controlled market rate include: (1) merchandise export receipts (with some exceptions); (2) payments by in-bond industries for wages, salaries, leasings or rents, and the purchase of Mexican goods and services, other than fixed assets; (3) royalties for the use of foreign technologies and patents; (4) payments of principal, interest, and related expenses resulting from financial and suppliers' credits by the public and private sector; (5) payments for imports with some exceptions; (6) expenses in relation to the Mexican foreign service and contributions regarding Mexico's membership in international organizations; and (7) other transactions specifically authorized by the Sec- retariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP). Eligible participants in the controlled market may choose to complete the transaction at a retail rate, agreed between participants and the banks, or at the "equilibrium exchange rate," which is determined for the controlled market each day at a fixing session (in the Bank of Mexico), in which representatives of the major banks exchange bids for purchases and sales of foreign exchange; the Bank of Mexico also may submit bids in these sessions. For amounts exceeding US$50,000, transactors may make completion of the deal contingent on the equilibrium exchange rate achieving a particular minimum or maxi- mum value. On December 31, 1987 the "equilibrium exchange rate" in the controlled market for the U.S. dollar was Mex$2,209.70 per US$1, and the buying and selling rates in the same market were Mex$2,193.00 and Mex$2,204.00 per US$1, respectively. Within the free market, no limitations apply to the access to, ownership, or transfer of foreign exchange. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in the free market were Mex$2,230.00 and Mex$2,260.00 per US$1, respectively. The Bank of Mexico provides, through the Trust Fund for the Coverage of Foreign Exchange Risk (FICORCA), an instrument for forward cover of foreign exchange for the repayment of certain foreign debt obligations in respect of debt contracted or rescheduled on a long-term basis with foreign financial entities and suppliers. On January 1, 1987 the Bank of Mexico began to operate a short-term foreign exchange risk coverage market through which commercial and financial operations are covered against exchange rate fluctuations. The scheme applies only to the U.S. dollar, and the coverage is based on the "equi- librium exchange rate" prevailing on the date of contract. All Mexican credit institutions are authorized to operate in the free market through exchange houses. Mexican banks are prohibited from receiving domestic currency deposits from foreign financial institutions abroad or from non-Mexican exchange houses, except when such funds represent the counterpart of foreign currency sold to a Mexican bank for the purpose of a borrowing operation, or when authorized on a case-by-case basis by the Directorate of International Operations in the Bank of Mexico. Financial institutions located in the areas bor- dering the United States are permitted to open checking accounts denominated in U.S. dollars for Mexican residents. On November 12, 1946 Mexico notified the Fund that it was prepared formally to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Foreign exchange policies are established by SHCP and the Bank of Mexico. The exchange control system is administered by the Bank of Mexico through Mexican credit institutions, which carry out most of the transac- tions in the controlled market. Prescription of Currency Apart from the exceptions described below, there are no obligations prescribing the method or currency for payments to nonresidents, neither in the free nor in the controlled market, but obligations deriving from the selling of foreign exchange in the controlled market must be made in the currencies approved by the Bank of Mexico. In accordance with the payments agreements with Ar- gentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Ven- ezuela, controlled market payments to these countries must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Bank of Mexico and the central bank of the country concerned, within the framework of the multi- lateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Similar arrangements exist with Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Yugoslavia. Imports and Import Payments In line with the program to replace import licenses and permits with tariffs, import licenses from the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Promotion are required for only 329 of the 8,459 items in Mexico's general import tariff, with the exception of temporary imports of raw materials and intermediate goods for export production. For the items subject to licensing, applications for import licenses may cover the applicant's import needs for six months. Import needs are estimated at 20 percent above 339 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MEXICO previous actual imports but may be increased when justified. New licenses are issued only if the applicant can demonstrate that at least 70 percent of earlier licenses have been effectively used. For some commodities "open- end" import licenses may be granted, allowing imports to be effected during a period of six months to one year, subject to an overall limit. Depending on the importer's performance, the license may be renewed repeatedly. Some imports are subject to the payment of a fee of 5 percent of the value of the import transaction; part of the proceeds are allocated to a fund handled by the National Bank for Foreign Trade (BANCOMEXT) and the remainder to the municipalities where in-bond facilities are located. All imports must be accompanied by an exporter's declaration of shipment. Imports by public entities and governmental agencies are subject to prior approval by the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Promotion (SECOFI). Beginning December 15, 1987, a new import tariff structure is applied, grouping merchandise into five ad valorem rates, ranging from zero to 20 percent. Imports from member states of the LAIA and other Latin Amer- ican countries are subject to preferential tariffs. A free zone regime is granted for certain regions until June 30, 1991; this regime allows imports to these zones without duties, as long as the goods are not similar to those produced domestically in the same regions. Importers may acquire foreign exchange for the fu ll value of merchandise already imported and for which payment has not yet been made. Importers must register a commitment of use (or devolution) of foreign exchange (CUDD) to obtain foreign currency for advance payments; they have a period of 180 days to show evidence of use of the foreign exchange for payment of imports and associated expenses or to return the foreign exchange if no adequate substantiation of its use is provided. Full advance payment for all imports is allowed if the value of goods does not exceed US$10,000, or if payment is made through letters of credit; in the latter case, there is a 60-day period in which to show evidence of use of foreign exchange. For an import value exceeding US$10,000, only 50 percent advance payment is permit- ted. Advance payment for associated expenses is per- mitted up to maximum authorized percentages (6 percent f.o.b. value for North American imports, and 8 percent f.o.b. value for other regions). Confirmation by suppliers is required for individual transactions exceeding US$10,000. Exporters are allowed to retain foreign exchange proceeds up to 100 percent of their requirements for advance payments of imported inputs. These facilities are also extended to the imported inputs of their domestic suppliers. Payments for Invisibles Except for the items specified below, payments for invisibles are made through the free exchange market. The payments made through the controlled exchange market consist of: (1) principal and interest payments on public and private sector debt with foreign financial 340 entities, foreign suppliers, and Mexican banks; (2) fees related to credits from foreign financial entities, up to 3/4 of 1 percent of the total amount of each credit; (3) expenses of the Mexican foreign service, contributions, and allotments for Mexico's membership in international organizations; (4) expenses related to foreign trade; (5) royalties and obligations deriving from juridical acts in force as of June 1, 1984 and recorded with the National Registry of Technological Transfer, with payments to be made through authorized Mexican banks; and (6) expenses on account of scholarships granted by the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) and those approved by CONACYT or the Bank of Mexico for studies in foreign countries. The contracting of insurance for persons in Mexico, or on property of Mexican ownership, or where the risks are on the account of persons in Mexico, or may occur in Mexico, is permitted only with Mexican companies, except when Mexican firms deem it convenient not to execute such transactions, in which case the prior au- thorization of SHCP is required. The provisions are not applicable to reinsurance. Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports do not require licenses. Exportation of a few specified items is prohibited. All merchandise export receipts in excess of US$1,000 a week are subject to surrender requirements in the controlled market, within a standard period of 90 days. Handicraft exports of up to US$8,000 per operation are exempt from the surrender requirement. Special procedures apply for the surrender of export proceeds beyond the standard limit of 90 days. Beginning September 5, 1986, if a sale of foreign exchange occurs beyond the required period without authorization, the applicable exchange rate is only a certain percentage of the rate of the selling day, which varies according to the delay in surrendering the foreign exchange. Exporters of jewelry and precious metals must surrender their proceeds through specifically authorized credit institutions. Exporting enterprises are authorized to open in Mexican banks special accounts in foreign currency; but only proceeds from exports can be deposited in such accounts. Interest payable on these deposits is equivalent to the rate of depreciation of the controlled exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, plus the corresponding Eurodollar deposit rates. Mexican banks are also authorized to accept de- posits in U.S. dollars by Mexican firms and grant loans in foreign currency for the production, shipment, storage, and long-term financing of exports. Such deposits can only be constituted in U.S. dollars and do not earn an interest rate higher than LIBOR plus 1 percent. Individual deposit accounts under this scheme must be for a minimum of US$5,000, with the exception of deposits made by enterprises in the free trade zones and border areas. Payments are made abroad in foreign currency. Under the Program for Integral Promotion of Exports (PROFIEX), a drawback system of import duty payments by exporters and their domestic suppliers is in operation. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution With effect from June 6, 1985, the Federal Government provides a facility called "Certificates of the Right to Import Merchandise for Export" (DIMEX), through which exporters with at least 30 percent value added may import, without permit or license requirement, up to 30 percent of the value of their exports; excluded from the scheme are 297 items of the general import tariff, representing 3.5 percent of total import items. Exporters are also eligible to purchase imported inputs at the controlled market rate, as are importers. In addition, they may use their export proceeds to pay for imports, associated expenses, and recorded financial and suppliers' debt. Under a three-year understanding on export subsidies and countervailing duties concluded between Mexico and the United States on April 23, 1985, Mexico has been granted the benefit of the injury test in countervailing duty investigations, in return for which it has undertaken to phase out export subsidies. Proceeds from Invisibles In-bond industries are required to sell foreign exchange through the controlled market for the equivalent in Mex- ican pesos of the payment they make for items specified in the Exchange Control Decree, including payment of wages, salaries, leasings or rents, the purchase of Mexican goods and services other than fixed assets, local and federal taxes, insurance premiums, interest and other accessory payments pertaining to financing payable in Mexican pesos, as well as any other operational expend- iture within Mexico. This regime does not apply to foreign exchange earmarked for payment of credits granted to third parties by foreign financial institutions for the construction of buildings, or industrial parks whose use or enjoyment has been granted to such in-bond industries, provided it has been agreed that the amount of the benefits from such use or possession be applied to liquidating the aforementioned credits. In-bond industries must sell their foreign exchange no later than the last business day of the month in which such expenditures are made. In addition, they must present to the Bureau of Customs at the SHCP and the Bank of Mexico, within the first 15 business days of each month, information as to the dates and amounts of foreign exchange sold to the country's credit institutions during the month immediately preceding, as well as the amounts of Mexican pesos they disbursed to pay each of the specified items. In-bond industries must effect these foreign exchange transactions through Mexican credit institutions. Capital Foreign investment, including the transfer of funds relating to increment of capital stock as well as payment of dividends, is excluded from the coverage of the controlled foreign exchange market. Accordingly, such activities are effected through the free market and not subject to any restrictions, having only to conform to the MEXICO norms contained in the applicable laws and regulations. Loan proceeds repayable abroad in foreign currency and obtained from foreign financial institutions or Mexican credit institutions are channeled through the controlled exchange market, except when said proceeds are used for the servicing of specified long-term external debt or for import payments. The Federal Government has own- ership and control over certain strategic areas, such as petroleum, basic petrochemical production, radioactive minerals, electrical and nuclear energy, specified mining activities, railroads, mail and banking services, and other activities so stated by Mexican law. In addition, foreign investment is forbidden in the following activities: insur- ance and surety bond companies, investment iunds, stockbroker firms, money exchange establishments, radio and television, the public transportation system, and forestry, as well as any other areas specified as such by the Federal Government. New direct foreign investment must have a majority participation of Mexican capital, except those cases approved by the National Foreign Investment Commis- sion (CNIE). Direct foreign investments in Mexico must be recorded with the National Foreign Investment Regis- try. Applications by foreign individuals or enterprises to acquire more than 25 percent of the capital of a Mexican company require the prior authorization of the CNIE. Under resolutions issued by the CNIE in December 1985 to facilitate inflow of foreign investment, no prior CNIE authorization is required for 100 percent foreign ownership of investment in in-bond industry stocks for stock acqui- sition by foreign investors, if as a minimum, 51 percent of such stocks were foreign-owned prior to such investment. Gold Goldsmiths or manufacturers may acquire nonmonetary gold through authorized Mexican credit institutions at the controlled exchange rate for the elaboration of products earmarked for export. There is a value added tax of 15 percent on sales of nonmonetary gold. Purchases and sales of monetary gold by Mexican credit institutions are exempt from the tax. Monetary gold exports are exempted from foreign exchange surrender requirements, up to a maximum of 200 grams. Gold may be freely bought or sold in Mexico at the free-market exchange rate. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement November 18. The Bank of Mexico discontinued inter- vention in the free exchange market. December 14. The exchange rate in the controlled market was depreciated by 18 percent, reducing the spread between the exchange rates in the controlled and free exchange market to about 1.5 percent.

Not for Redistribution MOROCCO (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Morocco is the Moroccan Dirham. The Bank Al-Maghrib fixes buy ing and selling rates for the French franc daily on the basis of variations in the value of the currencies of Morocco's principal trading partners, weighted in accordance with the geographic distribution of Morocco's foreign trade and the pattern of currencies of settlement. Buying and selling rates for most other currencies quoted in Morocco1 are established on the basis of the daily dirham-French franc rate and the cross rates for those currencies in relation to the French franc in the Paris exchange market. On Decem- ber 31, 1987 the exchange rate for the French franc was DH 1.45242 buying and DH 1.45678 selling, per F 1. On the same date, the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar was DH 7.7784 buying and DH 7.8222 selling, per US$1. All sales and purchases of foreign currency are cen- tralized in the Bank Al-Maghrib, but the authorized banks are permitted to offset purchases and sales on behalf of private customers in each currency separately. Each day, authorized banks must purchase from or sell to the Bank Al-Maghrib the balances of their purchases and sales in each currency; transactions are effected at rates fixed by the Bank Al-Maghrib. Compensation between banks is not permitted, so that no foreign exchange market exists in Morocco. The Bank Al-Maghrib also establishes buying and selling rates for transactions with travelers in bank notes, traveler's checks, and letters of credit denominated in "convertible currencies" (the currencies listed in footnote 1, including the French franc but excluding the Tunisian dinar) and specified other currencies;2 the au- thorized banks sell to the Bank Al-Maghrib their excess holdings of bank notes and replenish them at the Bank when necessary. A forward foreign exchange cover facility was estab- lished by the authorities effective June 1, 1979; the facility is available for exports as well as imports of items benefiting from special customs arrangements. Forward contracts for the purchase or sale of foreign exchange that have been concluded between banks and their cus- tomers result in reverse contracts between the banks and the Bank Al-Maghrib. They may be concluded in any foreign currency quoted by the Bank Al-Maghrib for maturity periods ranging from a minimum of 1 month to a maximum of 12 mon ths; the guaranteed exchange rate corresponds to the spot exchange rate, against the pay- ment of a commission of 2 percent a year, of which a share amounting to 0.25 percent is retained by the au- thorized banks; provisions are made for extending con- 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kuwaiti dinars, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Tunisian dinars, U .A .E. dirhams, and U.S. dollars. 2 CFA francs and Gibraltar pounds. tract terms, revising contracts in part, or cancelling them in whole or in part. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Exchange Office, an agency under the Ministry of Finance. This Office has delegated the execution of certain exchange control measures to authorized banks. Import certificates and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Com- merce and must be countersigned by the Exchange Office. Import commitments for liberalized goods are signed by the importer himself; they do not require the visa of the Exchange Office unless the country of origin of the goods is not the country of shipment, or the goods are bought on a c.i.f. basis. A part of the Port of Tangier is designated as a free trade zone and is exempt from taxation and from trade, customs, and exchange controls. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency For prescription of currency purposes, countries are classified as follows: (1) the payments agreement group, comprising countries with which Morocco maintains bi- lateral payments agreements;3 and (2) all other countries— the "area of convertibility." Certain noncommercial settlements with Algeria are made in dirhams or Algerian dinars through special accounts at the two central banks;4 all settlements with Tunisia are made through accounts denominated in con- vertible dirhams or Tunisian convertible dinars. Imports originating in countries in the area of convertibility may be paid for only in "convertible currencies" negotiated by the Bank Al-Maghrib. Other settlements with countries in the area of convertibility may be made only in con- vertible currencies negotiated by the Bank Al-Maghrib or through Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams. Nonresident Accounts The various types of nonresident accounts are as follows. 1. Foreign Currency Accounts are held by physical or juridical foreign nationals, either resident or nonresident. These may be freely credited with book transfers from abroad, with checks, traveler's checks, or any other means of payment denominated in foreign currency, except foreign bank notes,5 and with foreign currency drawn from the Bank Al-Maghrib following general or special authorization by the Exchange Office. They may be freely debited for book transfers abroad to the account holder or to a third party foreign national, for the surrender 3 Guinea and Mali; however, these agreements are inoperative. 4 This arrangement has been inoperative for some time. 5 With effect from March 21, 1988, crediting with proceeds from the repatriation of foreign bank notes has been permitted. 343 ©International Monetary Fund.

Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams are re- served for physical or juridical persons of foreign nation- ality, who may be resident or nonresident. These accounts may be credited freely with authorized payments due to residents of countries in the area of convertibility and with dirhams obtained from the sale to the Bank Al- Maghrib of convertible currencies, including bank notes.6 They may be debited freely for payments in Morocco and for purchases from the Bank Al-Maghrib of convertible currencies. Foreign transfers between Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams may be made freely, and there are no restrictions on the interest rate payable. Holders of these accounts may obtain international credit cards with which to settle their bills in Morocco and abroad. 3. Payments Agreement Accounts are held by the Bank Al-Maghrib for central banks (or similar institutions) of the countries with which Morocco maintains bilateral payments agreements (see footnote 3); they are used only for settlements with these countries, including settlements for imports and exports. 4. Capital Accounts, which may be held by any non- resident, are credited with funds that may not be trans- ferred abroad. These include the proceeds from the sale on the Casablanca Stock Exchange of foreign or Moroccan securities without retransfer guarantees and proceeds from the contractual or accelerated redemption of secu- rities quoted on the Casablanca Stock Exchange and lacking retransfer guarantees. Transfers between Capital Accounts related to countries in the area of convertibility or the same country in the payments agreement group are permitted freely. Capital Accounts may be debited freely for purchases of specified government bonds and for personal expenses of the account holder and his immediate relatives during visits to Morocco (subject to a limit of DH 30,000 a Gregorian calendar year for each account regardless of the number of beneficiaries or of journeys made by them to Morocco. However, at the request of the parties concerned, the Exchange Office is prepared to grant higher limits, upon presentation of specific requests giving fu ll details of the nature of the expenditure to be incurred in Morocco). 5. Suspense Accounts are used for holding nonresident funds not available for credit to any of the accounts mentioned above. Balances on these accounts may be used freely to pay taxes due in Morocco, and up to DH 30,000 a year, to pay the costs of the stay in Morocco of the account holder, the spouse, or other immediate relatives; but all other debits to these accounts require approval. 6. Two Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams are held by the Bank Al-Maghrib for the Central Bank of Tunisia and the Central Bank of Mauritania; at present, 6 Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams may be credited w i th d i rham proceeds from the surrender of foreign bank notes, upon presentation of the original customs declaration ju s t i fy ing the importation of the foreign exchange surrendered. 344 only the account of the Central Bank of Tunisia is operational. Imports and Import Payments Imports are admitted in accordance with an annual General Import Program, divided into two categories and applicable to all countries. Goods on List A may be imported freely. For a large number of goods on List B, quotas are not established, and imports are approved according to need, licenses usually being issued upon application (SB items). To import goods in List A, the importer signs an import commitment (engagement a"im- portation), which does not require administrative approval unless the goods are imported from a coun try other than that of origin or are purchased on a c.i.f. basis;7 but for goods in List B, an import certificate (autorisation a"im- portation or certificat d'importation) must be obtained. Cereals, sugar, tea, and fertilizers are imported by official agencies. For all imports the import title —import certificate or import comm i tmen t —must be domiciled (registered) with an authorized bank, wh ich may make paymen ts upon submission of the required documen ts. Import certificates require the visa of the Exchange Office before the foreign exchange is made available. Import comm i tmen ts require this visa only when the coun try of origin and the country of shipment of the goods concerned d iffer or when imports are contracted for on a c.i.f. basis. Special procedures are applicable to specified imports financed by foreign aid or loans. Imports used for the production of export goods can be financed directly from the proceeds of foreign exchange claims of the same exporter w i th in the framework of special lines of credit that Moroccan com- mercial banks are authorized to contract with their foreign correspondents. At the t ime the import transaction is domiciled w i th an authorized bank, a stamp du ty of DH 50 is levied on import transactions valued at DH 2,000 or more. Payments for Invisibles Paymen ts for most current invisibles require the ap- proval of the Exchange Office, but in several instances the approval authority has been delegated to the banks. The authorized banks are permitted to make payments and settle expenses incidental to the commercial trans- action covered by the relevant import or export docu- ments. Earnings after tax on approved nonresident in- vestments in Morocco are transferable to the investor's country of residence. The transfer of dividends on non- resident-owned shares of Moroccan companies listed on the Casablanca Stock Exchange and having their main office in Morocco is unrestricted; dividend transfer by unlisted companies requires the approval of the Exchange Office. Undistributed profits relating to the financial year 1968 or later remain transferable inde f in i te ly. Some paymen ts are subject to limitations. A foreign 7 C . i .f. imports of List A goods require prior exchange control approval. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution employee may transfer to the employee's country of origin, subject to the initial approval of the Exchange Office, 50 percent of his monthly wages or salary if the spouse does not reside in Morocco, or 30 percent if the employee is single or his family lives in Morocco; teachers attached to the Ministry of National Education are allowed an additional transfer of 35 percent for 30 days' leave taken abroad, 70 percent for 60 days' leave, and 105 percent for 70 days' leave. For the medical or paramedical professions, the assessment of transferable amounts (30 percent or 50 percent, according to whe ther the spouse lives in Morocco) is based on taxable income minus applicable duties and taxes. The same applies to other liberal professions as well as to persons engaged in industry, trade, agriculture, and crafts. For retired persons the calculation of the transferable amount (30 percent or 50 percent) is based on gross pensions. Moroccan residents as well as residents of foreign nationality who do not periodically transfer funds abroad and who wish to travel abroad are entitled to a foreign exchange allocation equivalent to DH 100 a person a year. There is a special allocation for pilgrimages. Resi- dents of foreign nationality may acquire exchange for tourist travel up to the equivalent of DH 2,500 a year for each passport by selling to an authorized bank a corre- sponding amount in foreign exchange (other than bank notes) from their own foreign assets not subject to surrender requirements. Foreign exchange allocation up to the equivalent of DH 2,000 a month is granted to foreign nationals residing in Morocco to cover the cost of higher education for a child s tudy ing abroad. A special tax of DH 100 a person is levied on Moroccan or foreign residents traveling abroad, with the exception of pilgrims, students, emigrant workers, and those trav- eling on official business. For business travel a standard allowance equivalent to DH 1,000 a day is granted, up to DH 10,000 a person a trip and within an annual ceiling fixed individually by the Exchange Office; exporters and professional members of the tourist indus try may obtain up to the equivalent of DH 1,000 a person a day, up to the equivalent of DH 15,000 a trip, within a ceiling of 3 percent of the foreign exchange repatriated during the preceding calendar year. The allocation issued for busi- ness travel may be added to the allocation issued for tourist travel. Moroccan students pursuing higher studies at the first, second, or third level abroad and who do not hold scholarships may obtain monthly allocations of foreign exchange up to the maximum equivalent of DH 3,000. Students holding scholarships are eligible for a supplementary monthly allocation equ iva lent to DH 1,500. Students are entitled to an annual installation allowance equivalent to DH 5,000. There is also a quar- terly allocation of the equivalent of DH 3,600 as a fu r ther supplement for scholarship students. The export of Mo- roccan bank notes is prohibited. Workers leaving Morocco to work abroad for the first time or returning to their workplace abroad may be granted DH 5,000 in foreign bank notes upon presentation of an employment contract. MOROCCO Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports may be made free ly, although export licenses are required for a few items. All f ru i ts, fresh vegetables, raw cotton, and cotton by-products may be exported only either directly by the producers or through a state-trading agency, the Office of Marketing and Export (Office de Commercialisation et d'Exportation—OCE), which is also in charge of wine exports. All exporters must sign an undertaking to repatriate and surrender foreign exchange proceeds. The surrender to the exporter's bank must take place within one month from the date the payment is due. The date on which the payment is due is the maturity date fixed in the commercial contract; in principle, this date must not be set more than 90 days after the date of arrival of the merchandise at the place of destination. When the exporter's bank receives the advice of credit in foreign exchange from abroad, foreign exchange is not automatically surrendered to the Bank Al-Maghrib if it represents the proceeds of mobi- lization of foreign exchange claims arising out of exports. Proceeds from Invisibles Residents of Moroccan nationality and Moroccan com- panies must repatriate exchange receipts accruing from all their noncommercial claims and surrender them to an authorized bank. Other residents must surrender noncom- mercial receipts only if the receipts result from current transactions. Moroccans working abroad must surrender such currencies w i th in one month of re-entry, but are permitted, when leaving again, to repurchase 15 percent of the amount surrendered. The importation of Moroccan bank notes is prohibited. Nonresident travelers may freely bring in foreign bank notes and traveler's checks; foreign currency imported in excess of the equivalent of DH 15,000 mus t, however, be declared to the customs authorities.8 Resident travelers also may bring in foreign bank notes in any amoun t, but these must be surrendered w i th in 30 days of re-entry. Capital Residents of Moroccan nationality, as well as compa- nies established in Morocco, are obligated to declare to the Exchange Office all foreign-held assets exceeding DH 250 and to repatriate and surrender certain of these assets. The disposal of other foreign-held assets requires permission. The transfer of capital abroad by residents must be approved.9 Remittance of the assets of emigrants and transfers in the form of gifts are not normally approved, nor is inves tment by private individuals in foreign securities or real estate. Exchange allocations for the transfer of inheritances are limited to the equivalent of DH 35,000 a beneficiary. Permissible transfers of assets by resident foreigners on final departure are fixed at 8 On January 28, 1988 the requirement to declare and state the source of funds at customs was abolished. 9 W i th effect from March 14, 1988, operations invo lv ing the conveyance of real property located in Morocco and belonging to foreign persons are no longer subject to authorization by the Exchange Office. 345 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MOROCCO DH 25,000 for each year of stay, with no upper limit on the amount. In the case of resident foreigners leaving Morocco, Capital Accounts and Suspense Accounts with a balance not exceeding DH 100,000 on June 30, 1986 may be transferred in their entirety, provided that the bank has submitted to the Exchange Office requests for approval accompanied by the necessary information con- cerning these accounts before June 30, 1987. A new industrial investment code, which came into force in February 1983, provides for full foreign ownership of Moroccan companies in certain sectors and an easing of repatriation of capital; it also grants fiscal and other incentives for foreign investment. In addition, an invest- ment code introduced for the tourist sector in August 1983 offers tax and other incentives to domestic and foreign investors in most areas of the tourist sector; it also provides for full repatriation of tourist-related profits after tax, without any restraint on timing. Operations through Capital Accounts that may be effected with approval include: (1) purchases on the Casablanca Stock Exchange of Moroccan and non- Moroccan securities; (2) purchases of Moroccan securities not quoted on the Casablanca Stock Exchange or partic- ipation in a Moroccan firm; (3) subscriptions to (2); (4) investments of any kind, including purchases of busi- nesses or office buildings; (5) lending to residents; (6) payment of local expenses in excess of DH 30,000 during the account holder's stay in Morocco; (7) any payments to beneficiaries other than the holder of the account or a close relative; (8) any payments from an account held by a foreign juridical person; (9) gifts to social, cultural, or religious institutions; (10) subscriptions to capital in- creases of Moroccan companies whose shares are quoted on the Casablanca Stock Exchange; (11) subscriptions at the time of issue to long-term or short-term, fixed-yield securities issued by a Moroccan public entity; (12) custody charges and commissions on securities; and (13) payment of the cost of maintenance, repairs, real estate taxes, and insurance on real estate located in Morocco. Subject to approval, Capital Accounts may also be debited for investments in Morocco, within the framework of the 1973 Investment Code, provided that the amounts debited do not exceed 50 percent of the investment undertaken by the nonresident and 25 percent of the company's total capital.10 10 With effect from March 1, 1988, the following types of inves tment have been permitted without the prior authorization of the Exchange Office: (1) participation in the equity capital of a company being estab- lished; (2) subscription to the capital increase of an existing company; (3) purchase of Moroccan securities; (4) non-interest-bearing contributions to partnership current accounts; (5) purchase of real property; (6) self- financing of construction projects; (7) creation or purchase of a sole proprietorship; and (8) operations to increase capital through the capital- ization of reserves, carryovers, or reserve provisions that have become available, or the consolidation of partnership current accounts. Similarly, operations involving the conveyance of inves tmen ts between foreigners no longer require the authorization of the Exchange Office, even in cases 346 Certain government bonds acquired with funds from Capital Accounts are freely negotiable between nonresi- dents. These are 7.5 percent, five-year bonds on which interest and redemption proceeds are transferable. All other transactions in securities involving nonresident interests, as well as the import and export of securities, require approval. Banks are permitted to engage in short- term borrowing abroad; they may accept convertible currency funds from nonresidents for credit to Special Deposit Accounts, provided that these funds are rein- vested abroad in the same currency and for the same maturity period. The rate of interest paid by banks on these deposits may not exceed the rate received by them on their corresponding placements. Gold Commemorative gold coins with a face value of DH 250 and DH 500 have been issued and are legal tender. Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Morocco for numismatic or investment purposes. Ten different types of foreign gold coins are traded on the Casablanca Stock Exchange, which does not, however, deal in gold bars. Imports of gold are subject to autho- rization by the Directorate of Customs and Indirect Taxes. Each year, the Ministry of Finance fixes a quota for the importation of gold ingots, which is then allocated among jewelers and industrial users of precious metals. Exports of gold are prohibited. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments August 1. Under the 1987 general import program, some items on List B, representing about 2 percent of 1986 imports, were transferred to List A. Payments for Invisibles January 29. The maximum allowance for business travel was raised to DH 1,000 per day, w i th a maximum limit of DH 10,000 per trip. July 14. The maximum travel allowance for Moroccan workers returning to their workplace abroad or traveling abroad for the first time was raised from DH 3,000 to DH 5,000. September 9. Education allowances were increased to the following maximum limits: (1) DH 3,000 per month for nonscholarship students pursuing higher studies at the first, second, and third levels; (2) DH 1,500 a month as a supplementary allowance to students holding scholar- ships; and (3) DH 5,000 as annual installation allowance. where such inves tmen ts do not entail guaranteed retransferability. In add i t ion, the banks have been authorized to transfer to nonresident foreign persons, w i thout l im i ts as to amount or t im ing, the income generated by the ir inves tment in Morocco (d iv idends, attendance fees, profits generated by the Moroccan branches of foreign companies, rental income payable to foreign nonresident recipients, and interest generated by loans autho- rized by the Exchange Office). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MOZAMBIQUE (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mozambique is the Metical (plural Meticais). E f fec t ive January 31, 1987, the peg to a basket of six currencies was suspended and the metical was pegged to the U.S. dollar. At the same time, the exchange rate was adjusted from Mt. 38.279 = US$1 (buy ing) and Mt. 39.069 - US$1 (selling) to Mt. 200 - US$1 (buying) and Mt. 204 - US$1 (selling). With effect from June 27, 1987, the exchange rates of the metical were adjusted to Mt. 400 - US$1 (buying) and Mt. 408 = US$1 (selling).1 Exchange rates for 20 other currencies are published daily by the Bank of Mozambique .2 There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control The National Planning Commission prepares annually, in consultation w i th central and provincial government agencies, a foreign exchange budget for the following year, as part of the Central State Plan. Imports and exports are authorized by means of licenses, within limits and on the basis of priorities established in the foreign exchange budget. Foreign exchange transactions, includ- ing the surrender of foreign exchange proceeds, are effected through the Bank of Mozambique, which is both the central bank and the only bank w i th external banking func t ions. Arrears are maintained with respect to external paymen ts. Prescription of Currency Mozambique has bilateral paymen ts agreements with Tanzania and the German Democratic Republic. Bilateral agreements containing bilateral clearing arrangement fea- tures are maintained with Malawi, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents in Mozambique can hold foreign exchange accounts in the Bank of Mozambique. There is no re- striction on the use of these accounts. Nonresidents in Mozambique under work contracts and having income in national currency that is earned from providing services under work contracts may hold national currency ac- counts in any bank operating in the coun try. There is no restriction on the use of these accounts. Persons or businesses residing abroad may request to open nonres- ident bank accounts for purposes based on legitimate interests they retain in Mozambique; credits and debits to these accounts must comply with the regulations 1 With effect from January 1, 1988, the exchange rates of the metical were adjusted to Mt. 450 = US$1 (buy ing) and Mt. 459 = US$1 (selling). 2 Austrian schilling, Belgian franc, Canadian dollar, Danish krone, deutsche mark, Finnish markka, French franc, Italian lira, Japanese yen, Malawi kwacha, Netherlands guilder, Norwegian krone, Portuguese es- cudo, pound sterling, South African rand, Spanish peseta, Swedish krona, Swiss franc, Zambian kwacha, and Zimbabwe dollar. established by the competent authorities. Ex-residents (nationals and foreigners who no longer enjoy residency status) may hold bank accounts in Mozambique, but their use is subject to prior authorization, in accordance with Ministry of Finance regulations; drawings may be made by the holders of such accounts for payment of taxes, a certain type of debt, maintenance of spouses or relatives, expenses while visiting the country, and other payments within the country. Imports and Import Payments All imports are subject to licensing, within limits es- tablished in the State Central Plan. In accordance with their objective, state trading enterprises can license them- selves for transactions within these limits. The license specifies the place of embarkation or disembarkation of the goods and the amount and currency of payment. Other enterprises may obtain import licenses from the Ministry of Commerce, which considers applications on a case-by-case basis. Imports of raw materials, parts and spare parts, petroleum, food, and medicines are given priority. Individuals may obtain import licenses for up to US$500 for personal use if expenditures from the coun- try's foreign exchange fund are not involved. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are processed by the Bank of Mozambique upon presentation of the authorization granted by the Ministry of Finance. Allowances for travel are made available to individuals only in certain cases, mainly for medical treatment purposes. Each Ministry receives an allocation to be used for business travel and educational travel expenses. Foreign experts working in Mozambique may remit abroad a percentage of their salaries, depending on the salary level. Nonresidents may export foreign bank notes up to the amount declared on entry. Exports and reimports of domestic currency are limited to Mt. 500 a person leaving the country temporarily for the purpose of meeting incidental expenses on return. Citizens leaving the country on business and private travel are entitled to purchase foreign currency at the border up to the equivalent of US$12.50 once a year. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports are subject to licensing, and all export proceeds must be collected through the- Bank of Mozam- bique. Export licenses are granted if applicable legal requirements are fulfilled. Exporters of traditional prod- ucts (cashew, cotton, copra, tea, sugar, and citrus) are allowed to retain a percentage of foreign exchange pro- ceeds for purchases of imported inputs. Since the begin- ning of 1987, exporters of nontraditional products have also become eligible to participate in the system. 347 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MOZAMBIQUE Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the Bank of Mozambique. Capital The Government, the Bank of Mozambique, and en- terprises are authorized to borrow abroad. All foreign borrowing is channeled through the Bank of Mozambique, which registers and guarantees such loans. The Direct Foreign Investment Law, published in April 1984, aims to encourage the participation of foreign capital both in the formation of new enterprises with exclusively foreign capital and in association with other Mozambican enter- prises. For this purpose, a Foreign Investment Promotion Office was established in 1984. The Direct Foreign In- vestment Law specifies guarantees to investors as well as the right to transfer invested capital and a portion of profits abroad. The incentives for foreign investments include tax and customs exemptions for specified periods of time and access to domestic credit. Gold There are no legal limitations on gold acquisitions. Imports of gold jewelry or other precious metals are governed by special regulations. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 31. The metical was pegged to the U.S. dollar and devalued by 81 percent (in foreign currency terms) from Mt. 38.674 (midpoint) = US$1 to Mt. 202 (midpoint) = US$1. June 27.

Not for Redistribution NEPAL (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Nepal is the Nepalese Rupee, the exchange rate of which fluctuates on the basis of a currency basket. On December 31,1987 the official buying and selling rates were NRs 21.50 and NRs 21.70, respec- tively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates are quoted daily for certain other currencies,1 with quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. Only buying rates are quoted for Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Italian lire, Danish kroner, Swedish kronor, Hong Kong dollars, and Saudi Arabian rivals, based on buying rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. Residents may freely purchase Indian rupees from Nepalese banks, and they may hold any amount of Indian notes and coin. The Nepal Rastra Bank guarantees free and unlimited convertibility between Indian and Nepalese rupees; however, Indian rupees are not legal tender in Nepal. Forward exchange cover is available only in U.S. dollars for export transactions. Administration of Control Permission is required from the Ministry of Finance for all payments in convertible currencies except for import payments and certain other specified payments. The licensing of imports from countries other than India is administered by the Department of Commerce. Each government ministry receives an allocation under the foreign exchange budget. The licensing of exports of most goods to countries other than India is also the responsi- bility of the Ministry of Commerce. All exchange trans- actions with countries other than India must be settled through authorized dealers (the Nepal Bank Ltd ., Nepal Arab Bank, Nepal Grindlay's Bank, Indo Suez Bank, and the Rastriya Banijya Bank). Nonbank authorized dealers are licensed to purchase foreign currencies; any sale of such currencies other than Indian rupees is subject to the prior approval of the Nepal Rastra Bank. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements apply to outgoing payments to countries with which no payments agreement is in force,2 and these may be made in foreign currency supplied by the Nepal Rastra Bank. All current transactions with member countries of the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) other than India (Bangladesh, Burma, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) must be effected through the ACU. Payments for imports from India are settled in Indian rupees. The proceeds of exports 1 Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Indian rupees, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and Singapore dollars. 2 Nepal maintains bilateral paymen ts agreements with Bulgaria, Czech- oslovakia, Poland, and the U.S.S.R.; payments for transactions under the agreement with Poland are settled through a special account in pounds sterling. to India are obtained in Indian rupees, while proceeds from other countries must be received in any of the quoted convertible currencies for which the Nepal Rastra Bank quotes buying and selling rates. Foreign Currency Accounts Commercial banks may accept deposits denominated in U.S. dollars and pounds sterling and determine the rate of interest on such deposits. Eligibility for the opening of such accounts is limited to (1) Nepalese citizens earning convertible foreign currency from employment in inter- national organizations, agencies, or embassies; (2) Ne- palese citizens earning foreign currency by working abroad (except in India and Bhutan) for more than six months; (3) international organizations and foreign nationals; and (4) Indian and Bhutanese citizens residing in countries other than Nepal, India, or Bhutan. Current and time deposit accounts can be opened, the latter for periods of three months, six months, nine months, or one year. Current accounts may be opened with a minimum of US$1,000 (or the equivalent), and time deposits with a m in imum of US$5,000 (or the equivalent). Nonresidents can withdraw their deposits at any time, and these can be converted into any convertible currency at the com- mercial banks. In the case of Nepalese citizens returning from overseas, foreign currency accounts have to be surrendered for local currency within one year of return to Nepal. Before that time limit expires, 70 percent of the local currency value of the deposit can be exchanged for import licenses in the same value and the remainder can be exchanged for local currency. Nonresident Accounts The Nepal Rastra Bank permits nonresidents to open "convertible rupee accounts" with Nepalese banks; bal- ances on these accounts may be freely transferred abroad. Accounts in Indian currency may be opened only under special arrangements. Foreign currencies brought into or received in Nepal by nonresidents, which are converted into Nepalese rupees and deposited with a Nepalese bank, can be reconverted for transfer out of the country, subject to prior permission of the Nepal Rastra Bank. Imports and Import Payments Imports from India do not require import licenses. All other imports require import licenses and are subject to quantitative restrictions, except imports under baggage rules. Imports of certain items, such as cigarettes and matches, goods considered harmful for health, arms, ammunition and explosives, wireless transmitters, pre- cious metals, and jewelry (except under baggage rule), require special permission of the Government. Imports of several items, including beef, washing soap (except from India), and detergent powder, are banned. Under the Trade and Transit Treaties, Nepal and India have 349 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NEPAL agreed to freedom of trade between themselves in Ne- palese and Indian goods; Indian goods may, in principle, be imported freely (although some are subject to a permit system in order to prevent their re-exportation, and certain others are subject to export ceilings in India). Reimburse- ment of tax is made by the Government of India to the Government of Nepal on direct imports from Indian manufacturers of products subject to excise du ty in India. Under a new system intended to simplify procedures for the importation of industrial raw materials from countries other than India and to reduce uncertainty about their availability, entrepreneurs may apply for a passbook. They receive entitlements for importers' inputs (in the form of a passbook for a period of one year) based on the previous year's production level and the current year's production program, with the possibility of their renewal after expiration. The total value of the passbook may be adjusted in case of changes in capacity. Import licenses are automatically issued against these entitlements. In addition to the passbook system, imports of 26 items, mainly raw materials and intermediary goods, are im- ported under the Open General Licensing system (OGL). Import licenses are also auctioned for specified goods. The total value of import licenses to be auctioned depends on the available amount of foreign exchange. Foreign exchange is automatically provided to successful bidders at the official exchange rate. A fee of 1 percent of the value of the license is imposed for all imports, including import licenses that are auc- tioned, with the exception of personal imports for which the license fee varies according to the goods to be imported and source of finance. Margin deposits are required on letters of credit as follows: (1) 10 percent for industrial raw materials, machinery, and spare parts, if imported by registered industries or allied trading enterprises; (2) 30 percent for development and construction materials (such as cement, iron and iron rods, and corrugated sheets), dairy products, writing papers, new print, agri- cultural goods, medical equipment, and educational and scientific materials; and (3) 50 percent for all other imports. Nepalese citizens returning from abroad who have spent at least seven nights out of the country are allowed to bring in goods worth NRs 1,000, free of customs duties and sales taxes. In addition, they can import, without license but subject to customs duties and taxes, special goods worth up to NRs 15,000 twice a year. For those who have official sources of foreign exchange earnings and have stayed abroad for more than one month, addi- tional imports are allowed. Payments for Invisibles Payments to India may be made freely in Indian rupees, but for amounts of NRs 500 or over, the purpose of the payment must be declared. For travel to countries other than India for medical treatment, exchange allowance is granted as recom- mended by a panel of doctors. Students studying at their own expense in these countries are granted exchange allowance covering expenses for boarding, lodging, and 350 tuition fees on the recommendation of the Ministry of Education. Foreign exchange is made available for certain business trips, but is restricted for tourist travel abroad. Payments for other invisibles depend on the essentiality of the transaction and availability of foreign exchange. Nepalese and Indian currencies may be taken out freely to India only by Nepalese and Indian nationals; the export of these currencies to countries other than India is prohibited. Foreign bank notes, other than Indian bank notes, may not be taken out by residents without per- mission. Nonresidents may take out the unchanged amount of any foreign bank notes they brought in; however, nonresidents, other than Indian nationals, may not take out Nepalese or Indian bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of items having archaeological and religious importance (such as ancient statues, paintings, and coins) and certain other products including gold, silver, gold and silver coins, diamonds, jewelry made of gold or diamonds, wild animals, musk and musk deer, snake and lizard skins, narcotics, explosive materials, chemicals for ammun i t ion, raw skin and wool, Coca-Cola, logs and sawn wood, and other specified items are prohibited. The re-export to India of non-Nepalese goods is not permitted, and re-export to any destination of goods imported from India is prohibited. Export licenses are not required, with the exception of a few specified goods, the exportation of which is quan t i ta t ive ly restricted or prohibited. The exchange proceeds from exports, except Indian rupees, must be surrendered to the Nepal Rastra Bank or to an authorized bank w i th in six months after shipment. Unit values are defined on an f.o.b. basis. Exports of ju te, ju te goods, rice, turmeric, catechu, oil cake, food- grains, pulses, processed and semiprocessed leather, woolen carpet, and ready-made garments to countries other than India in excess of US$1,000 in value are allowed only against irrevocable letters of credit. Foreign tourists leaving Nepal may take out as sou- venirs, without permission, Nepalese goods whose value does not exceed the value of foreign currency exchanged in Nepal. Commercial banks may grant pre-export credit of up to 70 percent of the f.o.b. value of products specified by the Government to all individuals and institutions holding irrevocable letters of credit opened or endorsed by foreign banks acceptable to the Nepalese banks. Such credit may be provided for a maximum period of three mon ths; this period may be extended without penalties under special circumstances outside the control of the exporter. Proceeds from Invisibles With the exception of Indian rupees, foreign exchange proceeds derived from transactions in invisibles must be surrendered to the Nepal Rastra Bank or an authorized bank at the official rate of exchange. Nepalese and Indian currency may be brought in only from India, and only by Nepalese and Indian nationals; the import of these cur- rencies from countries other than India is prohibited. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution When extending their visas, tourists are required to produce evidence that they have converted a m in imum of US$5 at the official rate of exchange for each day's stay. Nonresidents other than Indian nationals are not allowed to bring in Nepalese or Indian bank notes. Other foreign bank notes may be brought in freely by residents and nonresidents, but they must be declared. Capital No conditions are specified concerning receipts and remittances in respect of capital transactions, but official exchange is not normally provided for capital remittances by Nepalese nationals. Nepalese citizens, whether resi- deot in Nepal or not, are prohibited from making any type of investment in foreign countries, except inves tment specifically exempted by government notice; the exemp- tions include the purchase and sale of insurance policies abroad, investments abroad by any banking or financial institution incorporated in Nepal, and the purchase of shares of foreign companies under a rights issue. Foreign investors who have obtained an investment guarantee are eligible for outward remittances in respect of the following items: all or part of the sales proceeds of investment, dividends, interest, or principal repayment, amounts arising from the transfer of technology, and compensations on acquired assets. In the case of proceeds of investment sales and dividends, remittances may be subject to installments fixed by the Government.

The Netherlands participates with Belgium, Den- mark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Luxembourg in the exchange rate and inter- vention mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, the Nether- lands maintains the spot exchange rates between the Netherlands guilder and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in European Currency Units (ECUs). The agreement implies that the Netherlands Bank stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. On December 31, 1987 these rates were as follows: Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 100 Danish kroner 100 deutsche mark 100 French francs 1 Irish pound 10,000 Italian lire Netherlands Guilders Upper limit Lower limit 5.5870 30.2100 115.2350 34.3600 3.0870 16.600 5.3415 28.8825 110.1675 32.8475 2.9510 14.725 The participants in the EMS do not maintain exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper functioning of the system, they intervene in concert to smooth out fluctuations in exchange rates, the intervention currencies being each other's and the U.S. dollar. The authorized banks quote buying and selling rates for 15 foreign currencies and the ECU .1 On Decem- ber 31, 1987 the authorized banks' buying and selling rates were f. 1.77625 and f. 1.77875, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized banks are freely permitted to buy and sell convertible and inconvertible currencies, both spot and forward; they are free to deal with residents and nonres- idents, whether banks or nonbanks. Forward exchange contracts are not limited as to delivery period, nor is an underlying trade transaction required.

Exchange Control Territory Transactions with the Netherlands Antilles are subject to the same exchange controls as transactions with other countries. With regard to any third countries with which paymen ts agreements might be in force, the Netherlands and the Netherlands Antilles will, if so stipulated, con- s t i tu te the Ne ther lands Monetary Area. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Netherlands Bank on behalf of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economic Affa irs, and Agriculture. Import and export licensing, including transit trade,2 is handled by the Central Import-Export Agency (CDIU) and the delegated offices, under directives from the Directorate- General for Foreign Economic Relations. For their paymen ts to and receipts from nonresidents in the Ne ther lands, residents are generally required to use the intermediation of banks or other domestic institutions or persons authorized by the Ne ther lands Bank to handle these exchange transactions w i th in the scope of the regulations based on the External Financial Relations Act 1980 (see section on Capital, below). To facilitate the compilation of the balance of paymen ts, residents are required to indicate on reporting forms, for all payments to and receipts from nonres iden ts exceeding f. 5,000, the nature of the unde r ly ing transaction as well as the currency and amount paid or received. Separate regulations govern the reporting of settlements where no transfer of money is invo lved. Residents are free to open and maintain bank accounts abroad and to maintain current accounts abroad for the purpose of settlements. The Netherlands Bank must be notified of such accounts, and entries in them are to be reported to the Bank in accordance with the related regulations. Prescription of Currency In effec t ing paymen ts to nonresidents or collecting receipts from them, residents may make use of guilders or any foreign currency. Payments in any foreign currency between residents may be made freely. There are no bilateral paymen ts agreements in force. Nonresidents are free to open and maintain nonres ident accounts w i th authorized banks in the Netherlands in guilders or in any foreign currency, and to effect paymen ts to, or collect receipts f rom, res iden ts.

Paymen ts for interest, d iv idends, and contractual amortization due to nonresidents are permitted free ly. Nonres iden ts may export all unu t i l ized documen ts of value for travel purposes, as well as foreign and Ne th- erlands bank notes and coin that they have imported or have obtained in the Ne ther lands by drawing on the ir accounts or by exchanging o ther currencies. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required for only a few commodi- ties, mostly of a strategic character, and for some agri- cultural products, iron and steel scrap and related prod- ucts, and certain nonferrous metals. Residents may freely grant credit in respect of exports of commodities. The surrender of export proceeds is not obligatory. Proceeds from Invisibles There are no requirements attached to receipts by residents from current invisibles. Nonres iden ts may bring into the Ne ther lands for travel purposes any amount of foreign bank notes and documen ts of va lue; these may be used for traveling expenses in the Ne ther lands, as well as for purchases for which payment in cash is customary in the trade concerned. 3 State-trading countries are denned for th is purpose as cons is t ing of Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Repub l ic of Ch ina, Czechos lovak ia, the German Democratic Repub l ic, Hunga ry, the Democratic People's Repub- lic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Roman ia, the U .S .S .R ., and V iet N am. NETHERLANDS Capital Exchange control in the Netherlands is based on the External Financial Relations Act of 1980. This Act limits potential restriction to capital transactions, except when current paymen ts and capital transactions are interwoven, as in payment intervals relating to trade transactions. External capital transactions are unrestricted. Direct inves tment in the form of capital participations (inward and outward) is free of license. Short-term lending (for less than two years) to nonresidents (whether affiliated companies or others) is also free of license, as is longer- term lending. Public issues on the domestic capital market (w i th ma tur i ty of at least two years) on behalf of both residents as well as nonresidents are subject to a flexibly applied issue calendar. Notification to the Netherlands Bank at least three working days before the announcement of an issue in the market is required only for issues of f. 50 million or over. The relevant data on an issue are fixed by the Netherlands Bank as much as possible in compliance with the wishes of the applicant. For all issues of guilder-denominated bearer paper, management re- quirements are in force. Lead managers must be registered credit ins t i tu t ions and must have a full-fledged securities/ issuing department in the Netherlands. In addition, re- ciprocity requirements apply. Transactions between residents and nonresidents in all stocks and bonds listed on the Amsterdam Stock Ex- change take place at official market exchange rates and are unrestricted. Residents may freely purchase officially listed securities abroad. Placement with residents of unlisted foreign debentures denominated in guilders (such as foreign Euroguilder notes) and transactions in unlisted stocks are free of license. Nonresidents may have their securities, domestic or foreign, exported to them; secu- rities held in the Netherlands are not subject to deposit. Nonresidents may freely purchase real estate in the Ne ther lands for personal use or inves tmen t, and residents may freely purchase real estate abroad. Extension of payment and mortgage borrowing from nonresidents within the framework of such transactions are free of license. Gifts and donations to nonresidents are free. Emigrants may export any amount in foreign and domestic currency. They acquire nonresident status on leaving the Nether- lands and may upon departure have remitted to them their total assets in the Netherlands. Nonresidents inher- iting from estates in the Netherlands may have the proceeds transferred to them freely. There are no restrictions on commercial banks' spot external positions. Banks must pursue a policy to ensure that open positions in foreign currency and precious metals in excess of normal banking limits are avoided. In this context, the banks are required to report their position in each foreign currency and precious metal (spot, for- ward, and option positions) at the end of each mon th; for deutsche mark, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars, the same data must also be reported at mid- mon th. Authorized banks may freely extend foreign currency and guilder loans to nonresidents. The banks' 353 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NETHERLANDS freedom to accept deposits from nonresidents and to borrow abroad is unrestricted. All capital transfers by nonbank residents must be reported to the Balance of Payments Department of the Netherlands Bank. This includes suppliers' credits granted or received for periods in excess of one year. Totals of security transactions must be reported periodically by securities brokers and authorized banks or, if transactions take place through a foreign bank account, by the resident parties concerned. Gold Neither the Netherlands Bank nor any government agency imports or markets gold for industrial use. Au- thorized banks and nonbank residents may freely pur- chase, hold, and sell gold (fine gold, gold coin, and gold alloys) in the Netherlands or abroad. Imports and exports of gold do not require exchange licenses or import and export licenses. There is a free gold market in Amsterdam. Except for transactions of the Netherlands Bank, transfers of gold in bars and other elementary forms are subject to a value-added tax of 6 percent, as are domestic sales of gold coin. All other gold transactions are taxed at 20 percent. Commercial imports of gold jewelry and of articles containing minor quantities of gold, such as watches, require import licenses only when originating in Hong Kong, Japan, or state-trading countries (see footnote 3). Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 12. The in terven t ion limits of the Netherlands guilder within the EMS were redefined as follows: Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 100 Danish kroner 100 deutsche mark 100 French francs 1 Irish pound 10,000 Italian lire Imports and Import Payments Netherlands Guilders Upper limit Lower limit 5.5870 30.2100 115.2350 34.3600 3.0870 16.600 5.3415 28.8825 110.1675 32.8475 2.9510 14.725 (See Appendix II on the European Economic Com- munity (EEC) for a summary of antidumping duties, countervailing charges, and import surveillance measures introduced or eliminated on an EEC-wide basis during 1987, page 541.)

Not for Redistribution NETHERLANDS ANTILLES1 (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Netherlands Antilles is the Neth- erlands Antillean Guilder, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at NA f. 1.7900 = US$1. The official buying rates for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1987 were NA f. 1.77 per US$1 for bank notes and NA f. 1.78 per US$1 for drafts, checks, and transfers. The official selling rate was NA f. 1.80 per US$1. The Bank of Netherlands Antilles (the central bank) deals with commercial banks within margins of 0.00279 percent on either side of the official buying and selling rates; on December 31,1987, the buying and selling rates were NA f. 1.7895 per US$1 and NA f. 1.7905 per US$1, respectively. Official buying and selling rates for certain other currencies2 are set daily on the basis of rates for the U.S. dollar abroad. A foreign exchange tax of 1.3 percent is levied on payments made by residents to nonresidents.3 Purchases of foreign exchange by resident companies with nonresident status for exchange control purposes are exempt from the exchange tax. Administration of Control Exchange licenses, where required, are issued by the central bank. Import licenses, where required, are issued by the Department of Commerce, Industry, and Employ- ment. The commercial banks are permitted by the central bank to provide foreign exchange for almost all current transactions without prior approval. Prescription of Currency Payments may be made in any currency except the legal tender of the Netherlands Antilles. Receipts may be accepted in any convertible currency except the legal tender of the Netherlands Antilles. All payments made by residents to nonresidents and receipts through au- thorized banks as well as through banks abroad must be reported to the central bank for the compilation of the balance of payments. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may freely open nonresident accounts in any foreign currency. Nonresidents are permitted to hold nonresident accounts with authorized banks (positive balances) in Netherlands Antillean guilders. Balances in such accounts may not exceed NA f. 200,000 without central bank approval. 1 The Netherlands Antilles is a nonmetropolitan territory in respect of which the Kingdom of the Netherlands has accepted the Fund's Articles of Agreement. On January 1,1986 the island of Aruba, which was formerly a part of the Netherlands Antilles, became a separate nonmetropolitan territory within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. 2 Aruban florins, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Suriname guilders, and Swiss francs. All currencies other than the Netherlands Antillean guilder are considered foreign currencies. 3 Purchases of foreign exchange by resident companies with nonresident status for exchange control purposes are exempt from the exchange tax. Imports and Import Payments Payments for imports may be made freely. Imports whose delivery and payment dates are more than 12 months apart must be reported to the central bank. The importation of certain products for which there are locally produced substitutes is subject to quotas. Certain com- modities are subject to import surcharges in Bonaire and Curasao. Payments for Invisibles All types of current invisible payments and remittances may be made freely. A license is required if the delivery and payment dates are more than one year apart; the central bank must receive notification. Nonresidents may take with them on departure any foreign currency which they brought in. The export of Netherlands Antillean bank notes is prohibited, except for traveling purposes. Transfers of profits and dividends are allowed by the central bank upon application. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports do not require licenses. Residents are not required to surrender invisible proceeds. If export pro- ceeds are not received within 12 months of shipment, the delay must be reported to the central bank. Proceeds from Invisibles Residents are not required to surrender invisible pro- ceeds. Travelers may bring in with them any amount of checks, traveler's checks, or bank notes denominated in foreign currency. Capital Foreign investments and transfer of loans to residents in the Netherlands Antilles require licenses, which are normally granted. Outward flows of resident-owned capital are subject to control. Investments by residents in real estate abroad as well as capital loans to nonresidents require a license. Investment and disinvestment by nonresidents in real estate in the Netherlands Antilles do not require a license. Investment by residents in officially listed foreign secu- rities is permitted free of license up to NA f. 100,000 annually. Reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of securities is also allowed. Residents are allowed to hold foreign bank accounts without a special license. Transfers from a local bank account to these foreign accounts are allowed up to NA f. 5,000 per transaction. Authorized banks' overall position with nonresidents is subjected to limits set by the central bank, and must always be positive and in currencies listed in Article XXX of the Fund's Articles of Agreement and/or in Dutch guilders. 355 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NETHERLANDS ANTILLES Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in the Netherlands Antilles. Authorized banks may freely ne- gotiate gold coins among themselves and with other residents. Imports and exports of gold do not require a special license. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement May 18. The official parity of NA f. 1.79 = US$1, with margins of 0.00559 percent, was set as the central bank middle rate for transactions with the local banks, instead o f N A f. 1.80 = US$1. November 1. The exchange rate margin within which the Bank of the Netherlands Antilles deals with the local banks was changed to 0.00279 percent. Imports and Import Payments October 14. For imports subject to quotas, the quotas for 1987 were set at 60 percent of the c.i.f. value of 1986 imports. During the year, 15 products were added to the list of products subject to quotas. 356 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NEW ZEALAND (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of New Zealand is the New Zealand Dollar. The New Zealand authorities do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions; spot and forward exchange rates are determined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange market, although the Reserve Bank of New Zealand retains discretionary power to intervene in the foreign exchange market. On December 31, 1987 the closing buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were US$0.6595 and US$0.6585, respectively, per $NZ 1. The trading banks and authorized foreign exchange dealers are free to adjust exchange rate quotations in response to market conditions throughout each business day. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The trading banks and authorized dealers are permitted to conclude with their customers forward exchange con- tracts to buy or sell foreign currencies in exchange for New Zealand dollars, irrespective of the purpose for which the funds are required or the source from which they are obtained, and they are free to set their own rates of forward transactions with their customers. Forward contracts may be either for a fixed term or for optional delivery dates. The Reserve Bank does not maintain margins in respect of forward exchange transactions. On August 5, 1982 New Zealand formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Following the relaxation of exchange control regula- tions in December 1984, receipts and remittances of foreign exchange are free from controls. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand continues to administer the re- maining exchange control provisions, which are as fol- lows: (1) exchange dealers must be authorized by the Reserve Bank; (2) except for transactions involving for- eign currency bank notes, coin, and traveler's checks, which may be undertaken by any party, foreign exchange transactions must be handled by a trading bank or an authorized foreign exchange dealer; (3) for statistical purposes, except for small amounts, memoranda of re- ceipts and remittances are still required for receipts of foreign exchange from overseas and for remittances of external payments; and (4) information required for the purposes of prudential supervision of foreign exchange dealers and the foreign exchange market must be provided to the Reserve Bank. The Overseas Investment Commission administers the regulations governing foreign direct investment in New Zealand; export and import licensing is the responsibility of the Customs Department and the Department of Trade and Indus try, respectively. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from residents of countries other than New Zealand may be made or received in any foreign currency.1 Payment to and from New Zealand currency accounts held with banks in New Zealand by banks not domiciled in New Zealand is also an acceptable form of payment. Nonresident Accounts Overseas banks' accounts in New Zealand may be used for the settlement of transactions with other countries. Imports and Import Payments Under the terms of the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations and Trade Agreement (ANZCERT) and the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement (SPARTECA),Z almost all imports from Australia and all imports from the SPARTECA coun- tries are exempt from import licensing. For those imports that are subject to licensing, most licenses are issued under a tender system. Tendering is intended to provide a simple means of moving away from the licensing system. Once premiums for tender licenses fall to specified trigger levels, the goods become, de facto, exempt from the licensing requirements. Imports of cer- tain manufactured products —e.g., footwear, clothing, and motor vehicles—are subject to special industrial plans.3 Most licenses issued may be used to import from any source; the main exceptions to this are licenses under special schemes and agreements, such as the developing countries' handicraft scheme, the special trade license scheme, and the ANZCERT Agreement. The majority of licenses are freely transferable between importers. 44No-remittance licenses" for goods controlled under the Import Licensing Schedule may be issued in special circumstances —for example, for advertising material sup- plied free of charge, gifts, passengers' baggage, replace- ment of faulty or damaged goods, trade samples supplied free of charge, and temporary imports. Eligible imports from developing countries that have not graduated beyond a specified threshold are accorded preferential tariff preferences under the Generalized Sys- tem of Preferences. In addition, duty-free access is granted to all imports from 36 countries classified as "least developed" by the United Nations. With a f ew exceptions, tariffs are not imposed on finished goods that are not produced domestically. 1 Foreign currencies are defined as all currencies other than New Zealand currency. 2 The islands under this arrangement are those constituting the South Pacific Forum (in addition to Australia and New Zealand), Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Western Samoa. 3 With the exception of some industries subject to special industrial plans (e.g., footwear, clothing, and some motor vehicles), import licensing is scheduled to cease on July 1, 1988. 357 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NEW ZEALAND Payments for Invisibles The trading banks and other authorized foreign ex- change dealers are permitted to sell foreign exchange for invisible payments; and the remittance abroad of divi- dends, interest, profits, and other forms of contractual obligation to nonresidents may be freely made, although in both cases there is a reporting requirement for statistical purposes. Exports and Export Proceeds There is no requirement for obligatory return of export earnings (including foreign currency earned for performing services in New Zealand for foreign nationals) through the banking system. General export licenses, valid for five years, are issued to regular exporters. Particular export licenses, as required, are issued to new exporters or to those who do not export on a regular basis. Certain items classified as strategic goods may be exported only when specific requirements have been met and an export permit has been issued. Under the Export Market Development Taxation In- centive (EMDTI), the development of export markets has been encouraged through the provision of credit. To facilitate export competitiveness, import licenses can be issued to manufacturing exporters for materials and components where it is established that equivalent goods available from domestic sources have price or other characteristics that jeopardize export performance. Bonus import licenses are available to manufacturers who have exported manufactured goods in which licensed imported raw materials and components have been used. Proceeds from Invisibles Remuneration for services provided or to be provided in New Zealand for overseas residents by New Zealand residents (including corporate bodies ordinarily resident in New Zealand) and interest and dividends earned overseas from portfolio investment are not required to be repatriated. The disposal overseas by New Zealand residents of foreign income from other invisibles such as interest and dividends is permitted, and the foreign currency proceeds may be sold to a New Zealand bank. Travelers may bring into the country unlimited amounts of foreign and do- mestic bank notes and coin. Capital In general, consent is not required in respect of capital receipts, although overseas entities seeking to establish themselves in New Zealand must obtain the approval of the Overseas Investment Commission. Nonresident per- sons or companies wishing to make a direct investment in a New Zealand company through the purchase or exchange of shares are also required to obtain the consent of the Overseas Investment Commission in respect of any proposed offer for such shares whenever the invest- ment would confer on the offerer the beneficial entitlement to 25 percent or more of any class of shares, or enable the offerer to exercise 25 percent or more of the voting power at any general meeting. Residents are permitted to purchase foreign exchange for investment purposes. Emigrants may transfer abroad their entire assets upon their departure from New Zealand. Remittance abroad of legacies from the estate of a New Zealand resident is freely permitted. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coin in New Zealand without restriction. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than gold coin and jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the Customs Department; such licenses are not nor- mally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Commercial imports of gold jewelry are licensed restrictively. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments July 1. All tariff rates above 25 percent and not covered by the special industry plan were reduced by 10 percentage points. Exports and Export Proceeds March 31. The Export Performance Taxation Incentive was terminated. November 1. A voluntary agreement limiting meat exports to the United States was signed. 358 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NICARAGUA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Nicaragua is the Nicaraguan Cordoba.1 Nicaragua maintains a multiple exchange rate system, consisting of an official exchange rate of C$70 = US$1; a "free" market rate administered by an authorized exchange house on the basis of supply and demand; and several special fixed rates, including a number of implicit exchange rates arising from the mixing of the official and "free" rates for specified transactions.2 On December 31, 1987 the buying rate in the free market was C$15,000 = US$1. In addition, there is an unrecognized parallel market in which the value of the cordoba fluctuates widely. Only the Central Bank, the authorized commercial banks, and the authorized exchange house can buy and sell foreign exchange; transactions outside the banking system and the authorized exchange house are prohibited. Foreign currency-denominated accounts can be opened in the banking system. Nicaragua accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, on Ju ly 30, 1964. Administration of Control The exchange control system is administered by the Central Bank. The Central Bank has the sole authority to buy and sell foreign exchange, but has authorized commercial banks and an exchange house to make foreign exchange transactions. However, the Central Bank ap- proves all foreign exchange transactions in the official exchange market. All requests for official foreign ex- change are subject to a comprehensive system of admin- istrative rationing. Requests relating to low-priority im- ports and invisible payments are routinely rejected. The Central Bank is also responsible for classifying imports and for issuing export authorizations. All transactions not eligible for foreign exchange through the banking system can be effected in the "free" exchange market or through own foreign currency deposit accounts. An exchange house is authorized to conduct all transactions in the free market. Exchange licensing in the official exchange market is fully integrated with import licensing. There are four steps in the process of approving requests for purchase from the banking system of foreign exchange for imports. First, the pertinent sectoral ministry determines if a foreign exchange request is consistent with development priori- ties. Second, the Technical Commission on Exports and Imports (CTIE) determines that requests approved by each sectoral ministry are within their exchange budget 1 On February 15, 1988 a new monetary u n i t, the new c6rdoba, equal to 1,000 old cordobas, was introduced, and the new official exchange rate was set at C$10 per US$1. 2 The policy of guaranteed producer prices in local currency for certain traditional export products also results in d ifferent implicit exchange rates. allocation. Third, the Ministerial Commission on Foreign Exchange, which is composed of the President of the Central Bank and the Ministers of Finance, External Trade, and External Cooperation, determines if global demand for foreign exchange is consistent with the supply. Fourth, the Central Bank Commission on Foreign Ex- change Allocation (CAD) does a final check on the requirements of the first three steps and on the actual availability of foreign exchange. A representative of the President of the Republic may participate in meetings of the CAD, which has the final veto on requests. Importers using their own foreign currency accounts are not required to go through the four-step approval process, but they are required to show proof of sources of funds and are subject to an annual limit of US$10,000, unless higher amounts are specifically authorized by the Central Bank. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency There is no prescription of currency, but the customs authorities have the power to prohibit an export if the currency stipulated for payment is not readily convertible into U.S. dollars in international markets. Payments to Costa Rica and El Salvador with respect to trade and invisibles may be settled in Nicaraguan cordobas through the Central American Clearing House; however, there are monthly limits on bank notes per exporter for com- pensation through the Central American Clearing House. Trade transactions with Honduras are settled on a three- month basis in U.S. dollars through a reciprocal credit arrangement; if the outstanding balance is in excess of US$5 million, immediate settlement is required. Trade transactions with Guatemala are carried out in U.S. dollars. Imports and Import Payments All importers using foreign exchange through the bank- ing system are required to be registered with the Ministry of External Trade; this requirement can be waived for individuals who import only occasionally for their own needs and who make import settlements with foreign exchange obtained in the official market. There are three categories of registered importers: (1) empresa Nicara- guense de insumos agropecuarios, which has a virtual monopoly on imports of agricultural inputs; (2) empresa Nicaraguense de importaciones, which imports capital goods for the People's Property Area (APP) enterprises (these are state enterprises under the supervision of the Ministry of External Trade); and (3) commercial and industrial importers, including border traders. Border traders are given a general license to import or export up to the equivalent of US$1,500 a month (at the free market rate). In principle, general import licenses are valid until the end of the calendar year in which they are issued, 359 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NICARAGUA but the Central Bank may limit the validity of licenses in certain cases to only 60 days. For individual imports other than imports financed with own foreign-currency deposit accounts or with foreign exchange from the free market, a specific permit is required. Importers must initiate their application with the pertinent sectoral ministry. Applications with the higher priorities are then submitted to the Technical Commission for Imports and Exports for further screen- ing. Screened applications are submitted to the Ministerial Commission on Foreign Exchange for approval and sub- sequently to the Central Bank Commission for Foreign Exchange Allocation for a final decision. Imports eligible for foreign exchange through the bank- ing system are paid at the official rate of C$70 per US$1. Imports can also be financed with the use of own foreign- currency deposit accounts up to a limit of US$10,000 a year, unless higher amounts are specifically authorized by the Central Bank, or from the free exchange market. Payments for imports from the Central American region must be effected by bank check or certified check in cordobas, authorized for conversion through the Central American Clearing House. Payments for imports from outside the Central American region must be settled through the banking system.3 Some import payments are made with sight drafts, but most import payments are made through letters of credit. Central Bank approval is required to open letters of credit; the banks are not permitted to sell foreign exchange before the arrival of the import documents. Imports are not released from customs unless evidence is submitted that either payment or acceptance of payment has been made through a bank. In the latter case, the Central Bank must also approve the credit terms, but this requirement does not apply to duty-free imports from member countries of the Central American Common Market. The Central Bank may au- thorize deferred payments or payment with funds derived from properly authenticated credits obtained abroad, usually for imports of raw materials and capital goods intended for priority development. Many imports of nonessential consumer goods and capital goods used in the nonagricultural sector are subject to an exchange tax of C$300 per US$1. Imports of certain spare parts and capital goods used in the nonagricultural sector are subject to an exchange tax of C$100 per US$1. In addition to custom duties, many nonessential imports are subject to a special import duty of C$3 per US$1, and many essential imports, to a special import du ty of C$2 per US$1. Certain imports are also subject to a selective consumption tax, irrespective of origin, and to a customs fee of C$1,000 per ton or fraction thereof. In addition, most commodities, whether imported or domestically produced, are subject to a 10 percent general sales tax. 3 However, by v ir tue of Decree No. 1-L (effective March 1, 1963), the exchange proceeds from bananas, coconuts, copra, and coconut by- products exported through the ports of the region of El Cabo and the Department of Zelaya may be used by the exporters to pay for imports consumed in these areas. 360 Payments for Invisibles All sales of foreign exchange by the banking system for payments of invisibles must be authorized by the Central Bank and, except in the case of interest payments on debt contracted prior to May 31, 1986, are transacted at the official rate of C$70 per US$1. Interest payments on external debt disbursed prior to February 8, 1985 are transacted at a special rate of C$10 per US$1; interest payments on external debt disbursed between Febru- ary 8, 1985 and May 31, 1986 are transacted at the exchange rate at which the original debt was contracted. Holders of foreign currency-denominated accounts with the domestic banks may use those accounts up to US$10,000 a year for paymen ts of invisibles, unless higher amounts are specifically authorized by the Central Bank. Resident travelers are not allowed to take out more than US$500 in foreign bank notes at any given time, and may not take out of the country more than C$5,000 a mon th in domestic bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Five public enterprises under the Ministry of External Trade have a monopoly on the exports of coffee, cotton, meat, sugar, and certain nontraditional exports; export of these items requires a general authorization from the Central Bank. Other exports require specific authorization from the Central Bank, which is issued after it is verified that the export prices are consistent with those prevailing in international markets. With a few exceptions, foreign exchange proceeds from exports must be surrendered to an authorized bank within 30 to 60 days of shipment. Failure to surrender foreign exchange from export proceeds will result in revocation of the export license. Proceeds from principal traditional exports (coffee, cotton, sesame, sugar, and beef) are exchanged at implicit exchange rates which result from the policy of guaranteed producer prices in local currency for exports. Of the proceeds from nontraditional, non- agricultural exports, 25 percent can be sold at the free rate, and 75 percent, at the official exchange rate. Fifty percent of the proceeds from nontraditional agricultural exports may be sold at the free exchange rate, and the rest, at the official exchange rate. Under the special foreign exchange bonus scheme provided by the Central Bank for producers of cattle, coffee, and cotton, producers selling their product to the state marketing company are entitled to purchase from the Central Bank a certain amount of U.S. dollars at the official rate; the bonus varies, depending on the kind and quality of the product. Producers in the private sector can use these dollars for any purpose or exchange them at the free market rate; producers in the APP, however, must either deposit these dollars in special foreign ex- change accounts to be used only for essential imports, or exchange them at the free market rate to pay existing domestic bank debt. A few agricultural export products are subject to ad valorem taxes, which are applied progressively with the international prices for those exports. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from freight, trade-related insurance, transportation and port services, service income of Nic- araguan embassies and consulates abroad, receipts from telecommunications, and investment income of the finan- cial system must be converted at the official rate of C$70 per US$1. One half of the exchange receipts from insur- ance and port services not related to merchandise trade, sales of foreign exchange by airlines and hotels to cover local costs, commissions of travel agencies, receipts from car rentals, sales of foreign exchange by embassies, and receipts from movie rentals must be converted at the official rate of C$70 per US$1, and the other half, at the free rate. This requirement also applies to receipts from institutional cash donations. Receipts from family remit- tances can be sold at the free rate. Tourists are required to exchange US$50 at the official rate of C$70 per U.S. dollar upon arrival, but can sell any other amount at the free rate. Charges for hotel rooms (including international telephone calls) must be settled in U.S. dollars. Capital All capital transactions require authorization from the Central Bank. Foreign exchange receipts from loans and investments made under the Foreign Investment Law must be surrendered to the Central Bank through its authorized agents at the official exchange rate. Foreign exchange for servicing of external debt disbursed before February 8, 1985 is sold at a special rate of C$10 per US$1; for the servicing of external debt contracted after May 31, 1986, foreign exchange is provided at the official rate of C$70 per U.S. dollar; and for the servicing of external debt disbursed between February 8, 1985 and NICARAGUA May 31, 1986, at the applicable rate in the exchange rate at which the original debt was contracted. Depending on the availability of foreign exchange, Central Bank au- thorization is given for servicing private external debt. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Gold The Nicaraguan Mining Institute manages the country's gold production. The Central Bank is in charge of selling gold at prices prevailing in international gold markets. The Central Bank can sell gold to domestic, industrial, and other users. Commemorative gold coins were issued in 1967, 1975, and 1980. Natural and juridical persons may trade gold coins for numismatic purposes only. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement March 1.

The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.01 percent on transfers from countries outside the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) and one of 0.025 percent on transfers to such countries. Transfers by the Treasury and the Postal Administration and transactions in bank notes and trav- eler's checks are exempted. Banks levy a fixed commis- sion of CFAF 100 plus a proportional levy of 0.25 percent for transfers inside the WAMU. For transfers outside the French Franc Area, there is a further exchange commis- sion at a market determined rate. Seventy-two percent of the revenue from commissions charged by the banks on transfers outside the WAMU must in turn be trans- ferred to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of measures relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, Niger's exchange controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Bur- kina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. The contracting of forward exchange cover requires the prior authorization of the External Finance and Insurance Directorate. Such cover may be provided only with respect to payments for permitted imports and the currency stipulated in the commercial contract. The maturity period must not exceed one or three months, depending on the nature of goods involved, and it is not renewable. There is no official scheme for currency swaps or guaranteed exchange rates for external debt servicing. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the External Finance and Insurance Directorate in the Ministry of Finance. The BCEAO is authorized to collect, either directly or through the banks, financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public, any infor- mation necessary to compile balance of payments statis- tics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign coun- 1 The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Benin, Bu rk ina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 362 tries must be effected through the BCEAO, the Postal Administration, or authorized banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate of External Trade in the Ministry of Commerce, Indus try, and Craft Indus- try, subject to endorsement by the External Finance and Insurance Directorate, except for licenses relating to gold, which are granted by the Ministry of Finance. Import certificates for liberalized commodities are made out by the importer himself and are approved by the External Finance and Insurance Directorate. Prescription of Currency Since Niger has an Operations Account with the French Treasury, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the countries linked with the French Treas- ury by an Operations Account are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any French Franc Area country. Current payments to or from The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Ni- geria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Certain settlements with Nigeria are still effected through special accounts.2 Set- tlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in foreign cur- rencies, or in French francs, through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be credited with BCEAO bank notes mailed to the BCEAO agency in Niamey by an authorized bank's foreign correspondent. Otherwise, the crediting to non- resident accounts of BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is prohibited. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, without prior authorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes mailed by authorized intermediaries to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments All imports originating in South Africa are prohibited. Imports of soap, cement, and certain printed cotton fabrics are prohibited, irrespective of origin, unless a special authorization is issued by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Craft Industry. The import from any source of rice, paddy, hulled rice, wheat flour, butane gas, several types of fabric, certain footwear, and certain plastic goods requires prior authorization, irrespective of origin and 2 The bilateral payments agreement with Nigeria lapsed at the end of 1977.

A similar regime applies to imports of sugar, except from member countries of the Common African and Mauritian Organization, and to imports of matches, unless they originate in a member country of the West African Economic Commun i ty (WAEC). Imports from France and from countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account of all goods other than those mentioned above (or those listed in Article 1 of Order No. 042/MC/DCE of October 18, 1982) may be made freely without a license or certificate. Imports from other countries require either a license or an import certificate. Imports of virtually all goods from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and the six original member states of the Euro- pean Communities (EC), many goods from other Orga- nization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and their past or present dependent territories, and a smaller number of items from the United States and Canada are liberalized and require only an import certificate. Imports of nonliberalized goods from non-EC countries outside the French Franc Area are made under global quotas in accordance with an annual program determined each year by the Ministry of Com- merce, Indus t ry, and Craft Indus t ry. Licenses for certain cotton fabrics are conditional upon purchases of the corresponding domestic product. Goods not subject to quantitative restriction may be imported with an import certificate. All import monopolies and quasi-monopolies (de facto monopolies and exclusive trading contracts), with the exception of imports of petroleum products, were abol- ished during the second half of 1985. In particular, beginning from October 1, 1985, the Societe Nationale de Commerce et de Production du Niger (COPRONIGER) no longer maintains a monopoly on the import of specified commodities, including salt, cigarettes, green tea, and certain textiles. Effective November 1, 1987, restrictions on the number of traders allowed to import rice and quantitative restrictions on imports of rice and cement were abolished. All import transactions with foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when valued at more than CFAF 25,000 c.i.f. at the border. Import licenses or import certificates entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, provided that the authorized bank is satisfied that the import transaction is genuine and in accordance w i th the import title. Import certificates require the visa of the External Finance and Insurance Directorate if the goods have to be paid for before they are imported. Foreign exchange may not be purchased before the payment due date if the goods have already been imported, or until eight days prior to the shipment date if the goods are covered by documentary credit. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to the approval of the External NIGER Finance and Insurance Directorate, which for certain transactions has delegated its powers to the authorized banks. Payments for invisibles related to trade are per- mitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. Residents trav- eling as tourists to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account may obtain an ex- change allocation equivalent to CFAF 100,000 a person a trip (CFAF 50,000 for children under 10 years), which may be taken up to twice a year; any foreign exchange in excess of CFAF 5,000 remaining after return to Niger must be surrendered within eight days to an authorized bank. The transfer of savings from their salaries by foreigners working in Niger is subject to prior approval by the External Finance and Insurance Directorate and is normally limited to 50 percent of net pay. Larger transfers are permitted, however, against presentation of supporting documents. Residents traveling to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Ac- count, in addition to their travel allocation. Residents traveling to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes but, when traveling to a country of the French Franc Area outside the WAMU, must declare these if they exceed CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers may freely take out up to CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account, and foreign notes up to the amount declared upon entry ,3 or, if no declaration was made, up to CFAF 25,000; they may also take out freely any amount of foreign currency traveler's checks, etc., issued abroad in their name. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of rice and paddy to all countries require the prior authori- zation of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Craft Indus try. Exports of millet and sorghum are prohibited unless covered by a shipping document in the name of the Office des Produits Vivriers du Niger (OPVN). Gum arabic may be exported only by COPRONIGER. With the exception of peanuts, peanut oil, peanut cakes, sisal, cotton, cottonseed, and certain other imported items, all of which require a license, all other exports to France (as defined above) and the Operations Account countries may be made freely. Exports of domestic products and 3 This amount is reduced, when appropriate, by the amount sold for CFA francs and increased by the amount of foreign notes acquired in Niger by debit to a Foreign Account in Francs or a foreign currency account, by exchange for other foreign means of payment brought in, or by repurchase with CFA francs (such repurchase being limited to the equivalent of CFAF 25,000). 363 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NIGER imported commodities to other countries require a license and an exchange commitment. In principle, the due date of payment for exports to foreign countries must not be later than 180 days after arrival of the goods at their destination. Proceeds from exports, regardless of the buying country, must be collected and surrendered through an authorized intermediary bank within one month of the due date. All exports, regardless of destination, must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Ac- count may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered within two months of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin). Residents must surrender within eight days of entry any foreign currency in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 5,000. Capital Capital transactions between Niger and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require approval by the exchange control au- thority and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward and outward inves tmen t, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Niger. Such operations require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Nigerien Gov- ernment, and (2) shares that are identical w i th, or may be substituted for, securities whose issuance or sale in Niger has previously been authorized. With the exception of controls over foreign securities, these measures do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, member countries of the WAMU, and other countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Ac- count. Special controls are maintained also over the soliciting of funds for deposit with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate development operations abroad; these special con- trols also apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account. All the special provisions described 364 in this paragraph apply only to transactions and not to the associated payments or collections. All investments abroad by residents of Niger require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance;4 75 percent of the value must be financed from borrowing abroad. Foreign direct investments in Niger5 must be declared to the Minister of Finance before they are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration, during which he may request postponement of the project. The full or partial liquidation of either type of investment also requires prior declaration to the Min- ister. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Nigerien investments abroad or foreign investments in Niger, must be reported to the Minister of Finance and the BCEAO within 20 days following each operation. Direct inves tmen ts constitute investments im- plying control of a company or an enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Lending abroad is subject to prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct inves tmen t, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) loans contracted by authorized banks; and (3) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstand- ing of these loans, including the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 2 million for any one borrower, provided that the annual interest rate does not exceed the normal market rate and that the proceeds of the loan are imme- diately sold on the exchange market or debited to a Foreign Account in Francs. The repayment of a foreign borrowing constituting a direct investment is subject to the same formalities as the liquidation of a direct invest- ment; the repayment of other borrowings requires au- thorization only to the extent that the borrowing itself was subject to prior authorization. Foreign investments in Niger may be granted certain guarantees and facilities under the Investment Code of July 31, 1968 and its amendments. The facilities granted under the previous Investment Code have been main- tained. The new Investment Code provides for privileged or regular treatment. The latter provides assurances, for both new and existing enterprises, with respect to in- demnities in the event of expropriation and concerning nondiscrimination between Nigerien nationals and foreign nationals; tax exemptions may be granted for new in- vestments. Privileged treatment is reserved for enterprises deemed to be of special importance to national economic development and falling w i th in specified categories of 4 Inc lud ing those made through foreign companies that are d irec t ly or indirectly controlled by persons in Niger and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Niger. 5 Inc lud ing those made by companies in Niger that are d irec t ly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Niger of foreign companies. ©International Monetary Fund.

Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Niger. Imports and exports of gold from in or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from this requirement are: (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quan t i ty of gold (such as gold- filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) articles of gold up to a combined weight of 500 grams when carried by a traveler. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments November 1. Restrictions on the number of traders authorized to import rice and quantitative restrictions on imports of rice and cement were abolished; the tax on imports of rice was raised, and a tax on imports of cement was introduced. 365 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NIGERIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Nigeria is the Nigerian Naira. Nigeria has a two-tier Foreign Exchange Market (FEM), which consists of an auction held by the Central Bank of Nigeria and an interbank market. The fortnightly auction is organized by the Central Bank of Nigeria, in which both the authorized foreign exchange dealers and the Central Bank of Nigeria participate. An exchange charge of 1 percent is levied on transactions in the auction market. The FEM combines the fortnightly price-setting in the auction with the daily operation of interbank and customer exchange markets. There is a 1 percent max imum spread between buy ing and selling exchange rates for customer and interbank transactions. Authorized dealers must sell foreign exchange obtained through the auction with a margin of not more than 1 percent of the buy ing rate. For foreign currency obtained from autonomous sources, the exchange rate is free to vary in response to market conditions, subject to the requirement that the spread between the buying and selling rates quoted by authorized dealers is 1 percent. On December 17, 1987 the m idpo int exchange rate of the naira in the auction market was N 4.1413 = US$1. Forward exchange transactions at market-determined rates are permitted between foreign exchange dealers and their customers. These transactions must be the counter- part of an under ly ing import or export transaction, and the ma tur i ty of the cover must not extend beyond six months. The Central Bank of Nigeria, however, does not engage in forward exchange transactions. Administration of Control The Federal Ministry of Finance is responsible for basic exchange control policy and, in principle, for approving applications for capital transfers abroad; profits and div- idends; the granting of "approved status" to nonres ident inves tmen ts in Nigeria; and any dealings in foreign se- curities. The Central Bank is the principal administrator of exchange control. All licensed commercial banks and merchant banks have been appointed as authorized deal- ers by the M in is try of Finance and are empowered to deal in foreign currencies and to approve applications in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Bank. Any application that does not fall w i th in the scope of the authority of these authorized dealers must be submitted for the transactions mentioned above to the M in is try of Finance. Certain hotels and rest houses have also been appointed authorized buyers of foreign currency and traveler's checks. Private sector foreign exchange receipts must be re- patriated to Nigeria and may be sold in the FEM or may be retained in Domiciliary Accounts w i th commercial banks in Nigeria; they are not required to be surrendered to the Central Bank. 366 The administration of trade controls is carried out by the Federal M in is t ry of Trade. Arrears are maintained w i th respect to some external paymen ts falling due on transactions entered into prior to the introduction of the two-tier FEM. Prescription of Currency Authorized paymen ts may be made in naira to an External Account in Nigeria or in any foreign currency. The proceeds of exports to foreign countries may be received in naira from an Ex ternal Accoun t, in any foreign currency that is freely exchangeable for naira, or in any specified cu r rency. Se t t lemen ts w i th the central banks of West African states (for Ben in, Burkina Faso, Cote d' lvo ire, The Gambia, Ghana, Gu inea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mau r i tan ia, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo) are normally made through the West African Clearing House in West African Units of Account (WAUA). Resident and Nonresident Accounts There are four categories of res ident and nonres ident accounts: Ex ternal Accoun ts, Nonres ident Accoun ts, Domiciliary Accounts, and Blocked Accounts. External Accoun ts are ma in ta ined for diplomatic representatives of all countries and international organizations. They may be credited w i th authorized paymen ts by residents of Nigeria to res iden ts of foreign coun tr ies, w i th paymen ts from other External Accoun ts, and w i th proceeds from sales of foreign currencies. They may be debited for paymen ts to residents of Nigeria, w i th paymen ts to other External Accounts, and for purchases of foreign curren- cies. Funds derived from local sources may be deposited in Nonres ident Accoun ts. Such accounts may be credited with proceeds from services rendered locally, provided that the operation of such accounts has been reported to and approval has been obtained from the Central Bank before any foreign transfers are effec ted. Domiciliary Accoun ts may be funded by res iden ts w i th foreign ex- change derived from external sources, but not with foreign exchange purchases in the FEM. Blocked Accoun ts are accounts to wh ich are credited funds that are blocked by directives given under Section 27 of the Exchange Control Ac t. Imports and Import Payments Import licensing was abolished w i th the introduction of the FEM on September 29, 1986. Items that may not be imported are subd iv ided in to two categories: those whose importation is prohibited, and those that may be imported only as personal e f fec ts. The first category contains 22 i tems, among wh ich are maize, rice, air pistols, coun terfe it coins of any coun t ry, secondhand clothing, certain types of spirits, meat declared to be un f it for consump t ion, and indecent or obscene prints. The second category comprises 16 i tems, inc lud ing cigarettes, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution poultry (except day-old chicks), vegetables, fresh f ru i t, potatoes, eggs, textile fabrics, beer, fresh milk, rice and rice products, maize and maize products, wheat and wheat products, mineral water, and all sparkling wine. All imports valued at US$5,000 (c. & f.) or more, except those specifically exempted by the Gove rnmen t, are subject to preshipment inspection to ensure that all imports into Nigeria are of the correct quality and quan t i ty according to the contracts, and that only the normal price of that product in the country of supply is paid.1 Unless a "Clean Report of Findings" on the goods to be imported has been issued, foreign exchange settlement for imports may not be effected. Payment for imports covered by confirmed letters of credit is made by the overseas correspondents on behalf of Nigerian banks, on presentation of the specified doc- umen ts to the overseas correspondents. However, such payment is made on the unders tand ing that the goods paid for will arrive in Nigeria and that all shipping documents relating to the imported goods are lodged by importers with the authorized exchange dealer as agents of the Nigerian government within 21 days of negotiation of the specified documents. Bills of entry (for imports covered by confirmed letters of credit) must be submitted to the authorized exchange dealer w i th in 90 days of negotiation and payment by overseas correspondent banks. All other means of payment require submission to the authorized exchange dealer of the fu ll set of documen ts, evidencing the receipt of the goods in Nigeria. Delivery of foreign exchange for a valid purchase (spot) order must take place w i th in three working days from the date of the purchase contract. Payments for Invisibles Nigeria does not maintain restrictions on paymen ts for invisibles. Basic allowances are provided for some pay- men ts, and applications for amounts in excess of these allowances are approved automatically, provided that adequate documentation is provided to show that they are not for the purpose of transferring capital abroad. As with imports, verification is on an "ex post" basis —i.e., depending on the paymen ts arrangements, based on documentation obtained after the purchase of foreign exchange. The basic allowance for tourist travel is US$500 per year, and for business travel, US$2,500 per trip per enterprise, subject to a max imum of two trips per year. Travel for the purpose of attending seminars and confer- ences is subject to the basic allowance of US$1,500 per trip per person, w i th a maximum of two trips per year. Payments for international air tickets are to be made in naira. Hotels appointed as authorized buyers of foreign exchange may buy foreign exchange from visitors to Nigeria and may convert the unspent naira balances of 1 The following items are exempted from the inspection requ i remen t: gold; precious stones; objects of art; explosives and pyrotechnic products; ammunition; implements of war; live animals; f resh, ch i l led, frozen, or tinned fru i ts and vegetables; scrap metals; household and personal effects, including used motor vehicles; parcel post or samples; and petroleum and refined petroleum products. NIGERIA such visitors into foreign exchange at any time, provided that evidence of previous conversion into naira is ade- quately documented. However, reconversion of unspent naira balances by hotels is limited to US$100, or the equivalent per visitor for the duration of stay. These purchases may be made by the hotel only for visitors actually lodged at that hotel. Remittances abroad by expatriate residents of up to 75 percent of net salary after tax are considered by authorized dealers subject to documentation requirements. Final balance applications involving the transfer of accumulated savings are consid- ered subject to the approved guidelines and confirmation by the Central Bank, that the expatriate concerned had not previously been granted his final balance entitlement. The exportation of naira in excess of N 50 is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds The export of African antiques, works of art, and objects used (or which have been used) in African cere- monies is prohibited, except under prescribed conditions. Exports of unref ined gold and petroleum products require an export license. Exports of petroleum are handled by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and are subject to special arrangements. Foreign exchange receipts from private sector exports may be sold freely in the FEM or retained in Domiciliary Accounts; all previous requirements for surrender to the Central Bank were abolished, with effect from Septem- ber 29, 1986. Proceeds from Invisibles For statistical purposes on ly, declaration of foreign currency imports of the equivalent of US$5,000 and above is required. However, where the traveler may wish to re- export part or all of the foreign currency brought in the form of bank notes and traveler's checks, he must declare the total amount brought in even if it is less than US$5,000. The importation of naira is prohibited beyond the maxi- mum N 50 allowance to residents for settlement of expenses immediately following their return to Nigeria. Capital Applications for capital transfers abroad may be au- thorized if they are judged not to be destabilizing to the FEM. Except for the purpose of financing imports or exports, permission is required from the Ministry of Finance for any individual, firm, company, or branch resident in Nigeria to borrow abroad. In addition, official agencies and state-controlled corporations require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance for any foreign borrowing. The contracting of suppliers' credits abroad by state-controlled corporations or agencies is also subject to approval by the Ministry of Finance. The permission of the Ministry of Finance is required for borrowing in Nigeria (1) by any nonresident individual or company, and (2) by any company registered in Nigeria (other than a bank) which is controlled directly or indirectly from outside Nigeria. However, to enable entities mentioned under (2) to meet temporary shortages of fund s, licensed 367 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NIGERIA banks in Nigeria may grant loans or overdrafts for periods not exceeding 14 days, or may increase the amount of any advance or overdraft by the amount of loan interest or bank charges payable thereon. General permission is also given for any loan, bank overdraft, or other credit facility to be arranged to finance Nigerian imports or exports of goods. Residents of Nigeria may not deal in foreign currency securities or buy from or sell to nonresidents of Nigeria any security payable in naira without the permission of the Ministry of Finance. The capital proceeds of securities registered in Nigeria and owned by nonresidents may be collected and negotiated through authorized dealers, pro- vided that the prior permission of the Ministry of Finance is obtained. Exchange for the transfer of certain assets by emigrants or expatriates is granted on final departure from the country, but the transfer of the proceeds of assets realized in order to comply with the Nigerian Enterprises Pro- motion Decrees of 1972 and 1977 may take place upon receipt. Ceilings for foreign capital participation in the equity capital of enterprises in various sectors of the economy have been set by the Indigenization Decree of 1974, as amended in June 1976 and January 1977. Nonresidents intending to make direct investments in Nigeria may apply to the Ministry of Finance for approved status, the granting of which means that sympathetic consideration will be given to fu ture requests to repatriate the capital and related profits and dividends. Reinvestment of re- mittable dividends is allowed without the requirement of matching capital import. However, the granting of "ap- proved status" for such investment is subject to the approval of the Federal Ministry of Finance. The granting of approved status is not applicable to the purchase of shares on the stock exchange in Nigeria unless this forms an integral part of the approved investment project. Furthermore, this status is not normally granted when internally generated funds from profits, dividends, rents, or bank credit or locally raised loans are invested in local enterprises. With minor exceptions, foreign-owned com- panies and commercial banks operating in Nigeria must be incorporated in Nigeria. To facilitate the inflow of direct capital investment, the Industrial Development and Coordinating Committee (IDCC) deals with all matters relating to approval for direct capital investment, subject to the provisions of the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree, 1977. Applica- tions for the remittance of profits, dividends, etc., in respect of capital inves tment made through the FEM are considered by the Federal Ministry of Finance and ap- proved subject to documentation requirements. Funds so approved are repatriated through the FEM. Gold With the permission of the Federal Ministry of Finance, residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Nigeria for numismatic purposes. Residents other than the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and authorized industrial users are not allowed, without special permission, to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry or coin, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require specific licenses issued by the Federal Ministry of Finance; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and industrial users. Furthermore, the import of gold coins requires an import license. Imports of gold coin and gold and silver bullion are free of duty when made by the Central Bank; otherwise, such imports are subject to customs du ty at 100 percent ad valorem. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 14. The exchange rates at which transactions are conducted in the interbank exchange market were liberalized. April 2. A foreign exchange auction system (Dutch system) was introduced, under which successful banks' deposits at the Central Bank of Nigeria are to be debited at their bid rates rather than at the marginal rate, as was the case previously. June 15. Interbank auction funds were required to be sold at auction rates, and commercial banks were required to present documentation showing the purpose for which customers will make use of auction fund s. June 18. Only commercial banks that have been in operation for at least three years were allowed to partic- ipate in auctions. June 30. Commercial banks that were excluded from auctions as from June 18,1987 were allowed to participate in the auction. Rules governing access of individual banks to the market were modified. July 2. First- and second-tier foreign exchange markets were un if ied. 368 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NORWAY (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Norway is the Norwegian Krone. The external value of the krone is pegged to a currency index reflecting the average change in the exchange rates of the 14 currencies most important to Norway's external trade and payments. The exchange rate is managed so as to allow only limited fluctuations (± 2.25 percent) around the central value for the index. The weights of the index are, in principle, based on Norway's exports of processed goods to each of the countries whose currencies are included, also taking into account competitive relations with third countries. The exchange rate of the krone for the U.S. dollar, the principal intervention currency, is quoted daily, together with those of 18 other currencies, on the basis of the market rates. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar1 were NKr 6.2215 and NKr 6.2435, respectively, per US$1. Forward purchases and forward sales of foreign cur- rency against kroner must take place through a Norwegian authorized bank unless special permission has been granted for different procedures. On application and under certain conditions, business enterprises may be permitted to enter into forward exchange transactions with foreign banks. An authorized bank may purchase and sell foreign cur- rency for forward delivery from and to domestic and foreign banks as well as other nonresidents. In addition, an authorized bank may purchase and sell foreign currency for forward delivery from and to a domestic customer, provided that it can be verified that the forward transaction covers an authorized paymen t, that the forward contract falls due not later than the underlying paymen t, and that the amount of the forward transaction does not exceed the underlying payment. With the permission of the Bank of Norway, authorized banks may write currency options for nonbank residents. Currency options, in addition to covering a foreign ex- change risk in the period of an offer or tender, are subject to the same rules as forward foreign exchange transac- tions. Companies that conduct most of their sales on foreign markets and have extensive foreign exchange dealings abroad and close business links with foreign banks may be permitted to enter into foreign exchange transactions with foreign banks. Forward premiums and discounts are left to the interplay of market forces. Forward transactions with nonbank residents by autho- rized banks and foreign exchange brokers must have a commercial basis. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Norway formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from May 11, 1967. 1 Quotation on the Foreign Exchange at noon. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Finance and Customs in cooperation with the Bank of Norway. Most current payments are exempt from ex- change control, provided that they are made through authorized banks in accordance with the currency pre- scriptions issued by the Bank of Norway. Authority to conduct most current payments has been delegated to authorized banks, which report such payments to the Bank of Norway. Import and export licenses, when required, are issued by the Ministry of Trade and Shipping and, in certain cases, by the Ministry of Agriculture or the Ministry of Fisheries. Prescription of Currency Settlements w i th all countries may be made in any convertible currency, including Norwegian kroner in Convertible Krone Accounts (see section on Nonresident Accounts, below). Nonresident Accounts The main type of nonresident account is the Convertible Krone Account. Such accounts may be held by residents of all countries. They may be credited with authorized payments from any country, with transfers from other Convertible Krone Accounts, and with proceeds from the sale in Norway of convertible currencies. They may be debited for authorized payments from any country to residents of Norway, for transfers to other Convertible Krone Accounts, and for purchases in Norway of any foreign currency. Authorized banks are permitted to open foreign exchange accounts for nonresidents, subject to the regulations on such accounts (see section on Capital, below).2 Imports and Import Payments Most commodities do not require an import license, but all imports from South Africa and Namibia are prohibited. Certain textiles and garments are subject to import licensing for surveillance purposes. Following Norway's accession to the previous Multifiber Agreement (MFA) on July 1, 1984, the global quotas formerly in force under Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) have been phased out and replaced by bilateral agreements. In this connection, Norway has concluded bilateral agreements with 18 textile suppliers. The agreements entered into under the current MFA are considerably more liberal than those which Norway had under the previous MFA. Norway has been able to maintain its policy of not introducing restraints on imports from developing countries. Besides textile 2 Residents with both income and expenditures in foreign currencies may also open foreign exchange accounts at domestic banks without a license from the Bank of Norway. 369 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NORWAY products, there are licensing requirements for a few industrial import items from the Republic of Korea, for certain state-trading countries, and for some additional products from Taiwan Province of China, t With these exceptions, industrial goods may be imported freely upon presentation of the original invoice. Imports of certain agricultural goods are restricted, irrespective of origin. A global quota list contains a few quotas for agricultural products for which imports are permitted up to fixed limits; these quotas apply to all countries. New and secondhand ships and certain cate- gories of fishing vessels may be imported freely, but special permission is required in order to ensure compli- ance with the regulations regarding payments in advance of delivery. The import of radio equipment and radio control equipment is subject to approval by the Direc- torate of Telecommunications. The import of a small number of commodities is prohibited for health and similar reasons, and certain goods (some grains, alcoholic bev- erages, fishing gear made of textile materials, pharma- ceutical products, and drugs) are imported by government monopolies. Trade credits may be extended for export and import financing without a license from the Bank of Norway, provided the maturity is less than five years. However, a license is required if such financing is arranged through a foreign or domestic financial institution, although banks may extend short-term bill of exchange credits freely. Payments for Invisibles Payments to any country for all current invisibles, including income from capital and contractual amortiza- tion, may be made freely. There are no limits on the basic exchange allowance for tourist travel abroad. For business travel, the banks may sell reasonable amounts. Each person leaving Norway may take up to NKr 5,000 in Norwegian bank notes. Nonresidents leaving Norway may, in addition, export any foreign bank notes brought into the country by them. Exports and Export Proceeds Most goods may be exported freely to any country against a declaration or a license. Exports to South Africa and Namibia, however, are prohibited. Exports subject to regulation are listed and require export licenses. Ex- ports valued at not more than NKr 2,000 to any country are exempt from declaration or export license; for arms and ammunition this limit is NKr 500, and for fish and fish products, NKr 1,000. If payment is not received within 12 months of delivery, a license from the Bank of Norway is required. In principle, all exchange from exports must be surrendered. Proceeds from Invisibles In principle, receipts from invisibles must be surren- dered. A person entering Norway may bring in any amount in Norwegian currency and in other means of paymen t. t See Explanatory Note on coverage of Part Two, page 61. 370 Capital Inward transfers of capital and investments in Norway by nonresidents must be approved by the Bank of Norway. The regulation of inward direct investment in connection with transfers of share capital is limited to a reporting system. Outward transfers of capital require individual licenses. Licenses for outward transfers of proceeds from the sale or liquidation of investments made in Norway by nonresidents are granted free ly, and nonresident capital may be repatriated automatically. Payments for contrac- tual amortization are also permitted freely. Nonresidents are allowed to purchase nonquoted as well as quoted shares within the limit of the Concession Acts and the respective companies' Articles of Association. Foreign individuals and foreign firms are not permitted to buy Norwegian bonds; certain exemptions are provided for foreign insurance companies. Personal capital transfers, such as transfers relating to family loans, gifts, inheritances, legacies, dowries, emi- grants' assets, savings of nonresident workers, and amounts in settlement of immigrants' debts, may be made freely. Transfers relating to family loans require a license from the Bank of Norway. In general, resident-owned capital assets abroad, other than securities, real estate, and other authorized invest- ments, have to be surrendered. Norwegian shipowners, insurance companies, and brokers may open accounts with foreign banks; upon special permission from the Bank of Norway, other Norwegian firms may also hold such accounts. Applications for capital transfers to make direct in- vestments abroad are treated liberally. The granting of loans, credits, or guarantees to and investments in South Africa and Namibia, however, are prohibited. Residents are allowed to purchase quoted and nonquoted foreign shares. However, purchase of nonquoted shares requires a license. Norwegian citizens are allowed to buy foreign bonds w i th in a limit of NKr 1 million a person and NKr 5 million a firm. Residents may, upon application, transfer capital abroad to purchase real estate for recre- ational purposes. There is a 5 percent tax on such purchases. There are no nominal limits on authorized banks' borrowing abroad, but authorized banks and larger finan- cial institutions have to balance their combined spot and forward positions in foreign currency at the end of the day w i th in margins varying according to the size of total assets. Banks are permitted to hold positions in any currency that is covered in other currencies. A license from the Ministry of Finance and Customs is required to raise bond loans in foreign countries. All other inward transfers of capital by nonbank residents require approval by the Bank of Norway. Incurring or providing guarantee obligations abroad also requires ap- proval by the Bank of Norway. With the exception of loans to the petroleum sector, shipping, and shipyards, new foreign borrowing by Norwegian commercial enter- prises must be within overall limits specified for 1988 as ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution the equivalent of NKr 10 billion for medium- and long- term loans; the level of short-term loans during 1988 should not exceed the outstanding amount at the end of 1987 of NKr 13.8 billion. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form. No customs duties or other charges or fees are payable on imports or exports of gold bullion and gold coin not contained in jewelry. Domestic sales of gold bullion and gold coin are subject to the regular value- added tax at a rate of 20 percent. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments March 20.

Not for Redistribution OMAN (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Oman is the Rial Omani, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at RO 1 = US$2.6008. Oman avails itself of wider margins. The Central Bank of Oman maintains fixed buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar; on December 31, 1987 these rates were RO 1 = US$2.6042 and RO 1 = US$2.5974, respectively. The commercial banks' rates for other currencies are based on market rates in London. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Oman informed the Fund on June 19, 1974 that it formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sec- tions 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Central Bank, but there is no exchange control legislation in Oman. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited, and the use of their currencies is also prohibited. No other prescription of currency requirements are in force. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Imports of a few commodities are prohibited for reasons of health, security, or public policy. In addition, com- panies operating in Oman and trading in manufactured oil products are prohibited from importing such products as long as the domestic refinery is deemed by Oman to be producing the specified products in quantities that satisfy local demand. Licenses are required for imports; exchange for payments abroad for authorized imports may be obtained freely. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited, and exports or re-exports of live animals and foodstuffs may be prohibited in times of shortage in Oman. All other commodities may be exported freely. There are no re- quirements attached to receipts from exports or re- exports; the proceeds need not be repatriated or surren- dered, and they may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. Exports of Maria Theresa dollars are prohibited. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for and proceeds from invisibles are not restricted. Payments must not, however, be made to or be received from Israel or South Africa. Travelers may bring in or take out any amount in domestic or foreign bank notes. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents, except that no payments may be made to or received from Israel or South Africa. Investment in business firms in Oman by foreign physical or juridical persons requires prior approval. Such investment is regulated by a foreign investment law enacted in June 1983, and by a law for the Organization and Encouragement of Industry, which came into effect on January 15, 1979. Under the 1983 foreign investment law, joint ventures are offered a five- year tax holiday, renewable for an additional period of five years under certain conditions; the Oman Develop- ment Bank can provide medium- and long-term loans at preferential interest rates for project financing in petro- leum, agricultural, fishery, and mineral sectors; and as- sistance in preinvestment research can also be given. Foreign investment is not permitted in trade and services, and foreign capital is encouraged to be directed to large production or manufacturing projects. Gold The monetary authorities and authorized resident and nonresident banks may, without license, purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form at home or abroad. They may also import and export gold in any form without a license and without payment of any customs duties or tax. Transactions involving Israel and South Africa are prohibited.

Not for Redistribution PAKISTAN (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Pakistan is the Pakistan Rupee, for which the U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. A managed floating exchange rate system is operated, under which the State Bank of Pakistan (the central bank) sets on a daily basis the rate at which it will purchase and sell U.S. dollars in its dealings with authorized dealers. On December 31, 1987 the State Bank's spot buying and selling rates for transactions with authorized dealers were PRs 17.4500 and PRs 17.5373, respectively, per US$1. The buying and selling rates forward up to 6 months were PRs 17.4500 and PRs 17.7991 per US$1, respectively; the buying and selling rates forward up to 12 months were PRs 16.9265 and PRs 18.0608 per US$1, respectively. All transactions with the public in foreign exchange must be conducted through authorized dealers and money chan- gers, whose dealings must be effected at rates authorized by the State Bank. In the calculation of spot exchange rates for other currencies, a margin of 0.50 percent is provided on the previous day's closing buying and selling rates for the currency concerned in the New York market. Authorized dealers in Pakistan are permitted to cover their requirements of specified currencies in foreign ex- change markets abroad. They may also cover their per- mitted transactions in specified currencies against U.S. dollars or Pakistan rupees, either spot or forward for a limited period, with their agents in the countries con- cerned. In addition, they offer forward cover in the currencies of member countries for exports and imports effected under the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) arrange- ment, with the State Bank standing ready to cover forward contracts reported by authorized dealers. Forward exchange cover in respect of private foreign currency loans and suppliers' credits, as well as foreign currency loans under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) scheme, is covered by the State Bank under the Government's scheme for exchange risk cover, on payment of a fee based on the difference between the interest rates in Pakistan and international markets. In addition, forward exchange cover in respect of repatriable foreign currency loans for working capital requirements is allowed by the State Bank upon payment of a fee based on the difference between the interest rate in Pakistan and the interest rate payable on the loan. Since August 1, 1985, Foreign Exchange Bearer Cer- tificates (FEBC) can be purchased in foreign exchange by foreigners and Pakistanis. Denominated in Pakistan rupees, FEBCs can be freely brought into and taken out of the country, and can be encashed at any time in Pakistan rupees or in foreign exchange at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the encashment. These certificates are traded on the stock exchange and are intended to provide a vehicle for residents freely to undertake current and capital transactions. On Decem- ber 31, 1987 the certificates were quoted at a premium of 8.25 percent. Administration of Control The State Bank has delegated authority to a number of banks and financial institutions to deal in all foreign currencies, to supervise surrender requirements, and to sell exchange for specified purposes within limits pre- scribed by the State Bank. The Chief Controller of Imports and Exports is responsible for the issue of licenses and permits, as well as the implementation of import and export policies. Certain foreign trade transactions are conducted through various state-trading agencies, such as the Trading Corporation of Pakistan, Ltd. (TCP), the Cotton Export Corporation, Ltd. (CECP), and the Rice Export Corporation, Ltd. (RECP). Prescription of Currency Exchange receipts and payments abroad must be ef- fected through an authorized foreign exchange dealer, in principle, in any convertible currency or in Pakistan rupees from or to nonresident rupee bank accounts. Certain settlements with specified countries are channeled through special accounts. Letters of credit for imports from all other countries must be established in foreign currency or in Pakistan rupees for credit to a nonresident bank account of the country of the beneficiary or of the country of origin or shipment of goods. Trade transactions under "barter" agreements are settled through special accounts in inconvertible curren- cies. Trade in specified commodities with Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Poland, Sweden, and the U.S.S.R. is settled through special nonconvertible accounts. The special accounts with Bul- garia, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, and the U.S.S.R. are main- tained in nonconvertible U.S. dollars, and the special account with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is denominated in deutsche mark. Payments to and from the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey relating to visible trade (excluding border trade and defense materials) are settled through clearing ac- counts maintained by the respective central banks in U.S. dollars. Payments to, and receipts from, member countries of the ACU, other than the Islamic Republic of Iran (i.e., Bangladesh, Burma, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka), in respect of current transactions (other than those relating to petroleum, natural gas, and their products) are effected through the ACU in Asian Monetary Units (AMUs) or in the domestic currency of one of the member countries involved in such transactions. No exchange control is exercised over transactions with Afghanistan, and settle- ments are made in Pakistan rupees or in Afghan currency. 373 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PAKISTAN Payments between Pakistan and Israel and South Africa are suspended. Nonresident Accounts The accounts of individuals, firms, or companies resi- dent outside Pakistan are designated as nonresident ac- counts.1 Authorized banks are permitted to open nonres- ident accounts for nonbank nonresidents without the prior approval of the State Bank in cases where the accounts are to be opened with funds received from abroad through banking channels or with rupee funds that have been accepted for remittance abroad. Debits and credits to nonresident accounts for specified purposes may be made by authorized banks without the prior approval of the State Bank. Accounts of residents of India, other than the accounts of the Indian Embassy and its personnel, are blocked. Pakistani nationals residing abroad and foreign nation- als, whether resident abroad or in Pakistan, and firms and corporations and charitable bodies owned by persons who are otherwise eligible to open foreign currency accounts may open foreign currency accounts with banks in Pakistan without prior approval of the exchange control authorities. There are no restrictions on the currencies in which the accounts may be denominated; credit balances may be transferred abroad, and interest on such accounts is exempt from income tax. A deposit holder wishing to make payments in Pakistan must first convert the foreign exchange drawn from his account into Pakistan rupees. If a Pakistani national holding such an account returns to Pakistan, he may retain the account unless his stay exceeds three years; thereafter, the account must be closed and the exchange surrendered. Banks in Pakistan receiving such deposits must sell the foreign exchange to the State Bank. Authorized dealers under the foreign currency accounts facility may accept term deposits in foreign currency from banks operating abroad, including financial institutions owned by them; such term deposits must be at least US$10 million (or equivalent in other currencies), for a maturity period of at least one year. Imports and Import Payments The 1987/88-1989/90 Import Policy Order (IPO) outlines the regulations applicable to imports. The IPO divides imports into two categories: prohibited and negative list imports, and restricted imports. All items that do not appear either on the prohibited/negative lists or restricted lists are freely importable. The prohibited and negative lists in principle consist of items banned for religious, security, or luxury consumption reasons; capital and consumer goods banned temporarily for protective rea- sons; and intermediate goods used mainly in the produc- tion of capital and consumer goods banned for protective reasons.2 1 Different rules apply to nonresident rupee accounts of individuals, firms, or companies, on the one hand, and to nonresident rupee accounts of banks, on the other hand. 2 Some categories of currently prohibited imports fall outside of these categories (i.e., some prohibited items are not produced in Pakistan and they do not fit into the category of goods banned for religious, security, or luxury consumption reasons). 374 The restricted list of imports consists of seven cate- gories: (1) 37 items or categories of goods importable only by the public sector; (2) 20 items or categories of goods importable only by industrial consumers; (3) import requirements of 12 specific industries; (4) imports by actual users of 11 items or categories of goods for an amount exceeding PRs 5,000; (5) 33 items or categories of goods importable, subject to specified requirements, such as a permit by a public sector agency or fulfillment of technical specifications; (6) 20 items or categories importable only from specified sources under credits, barter trade, loans, or the U.S. P.L. 480 program; and (7) 4 specified consumer goods items subject to quanti- tative restriction. Imports of some items on the negative list are permitted under certain circumstances, principally by export industries, public sector agencies, or under the personal baggage scheme. All imports require a license, except goods imported by the Central Government for defense or other purposes, goods in transit, personal baggage, certain imports over the land routes from Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and certain other items permitted under a Ministry of Commerce Notification. Licenses are issued on the basis of notification by the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports.3 Generally, licenses remain valid for 12 months, but when machinery is specifically manufactured, licenses can be obtained with a validity period of up to 24 months. Licenses for imports are subject to a fee of 4 percent of the value of the license, payable at the time of issue. The import regime is subject to certain other supple- mentary qualifications, the most important of which are as follows: (1) Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited, as are imports of goods originating in these countries but shipped from third countries. The private sector can import from India 42 specified items either directly or through the TCP. Imports of other nonprohib- ited goods from India (including goods of Indian origin from a third country) are allowed only for the public sector. (2) Dates may be imported only from Iraq. (3) Special provisions exist for the importation by export industries of items on the restricted (tied) list from untied sources and items on the negative list. Machinery on the negative list may also be imported by nonexporting industries up to specified amounts. (4) Private sector importers, other than those importing goods for personal use, who apply for import licenses for goods valued at PRs 20,000 or more, must be members of approved trade organizations. (5) The maximum c. & f. values for which licenses for the import of machinery and millwork can be issued against various sources of financing to different categories are (a) up to PRs 10 million for commercial importers; (b) up to PRs 50 million for new units or expansion of existing un i ts that are likely to cost less than PRs 500 million and not falling within the specified list of industries (i.e., those that are permitted to be set 3 Licensing restrictions are applicable to arms and ammun i t ion, milk products, and Ovaltine. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution up without sanction of any government agency). In the case of units falling within a specified list of industries, the limit of PRs 50 million applies, subject to the condition that such units are duly sanctioned by the competent authority; (c) up to PRs 10 million for balancing modern- ization and replacement of existing un i ts excluding textiles indus try; and (d) from PRs 5 million to PRs 20 million for balancing, modernization, and replacement of a un i t, depending on the type and capacity of the machinery. Procurement of plant and equipment of a higher value is effected by the financing ins t i tu t ions, with the approval of the Ministry of Indus try. Except for imports of books, journals, periodicals, and magazines, irrevocable letters of credit must be opened for all commercial imports. In principle, such letters of credit have to be opened w i th in 60 days after registration of the license with the State Bank of Pakistan for private and public sector imports (and within 30 days for food imports), or in the case of imports under barter agree- ments, within such period as may be specified in related official Public Notices. For imports under tied loans or credits, which require that the contract be approved by the Economic Affairs Division or another specified agency, licenses for both private and public sector imports remain valid for the opening of a letter of credit for 30 days after final approval of the contract. Oil companies and refineries are free to open letters of credit for the import of crude oil and petroleum products within the validity period of the underlying license. Remittances are not normally permitted before shipping documents are received, but in special cases —e.g., machinery and other capital goods for which deposits have to be paid to foreign manufac- turers —the State Bank may authorize advance payments for a part of the value of the goods. Authorized dealers may also make advance remittances, without prior ap- proval of the State Bank, for imports of books, magazines, and journals by commercial importers. No payments are permitted for goods originating in or consigned from Israel or South Africa. With specified exceptions,4 the State Bank requires banks to take min- imum margins against letters of credit for certain imports, ranging from 25 percent to 35 percent. A 10 percent import surcharge is levied on the c.i.f. value of imports, excluding certain items like medicine, books, and duty-free baggage. However, the surcharge is limited to 5 percent for imported kerosene oil, light diesel by the agricultural sector, and fuel oil by the industrial sector. A 5 percent surcharge is also levied on imported raw materials, but the proceeds are rebated if the imported raw materials are used for manufacturing of exports. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are controlled by the State Bank and in many cases require its prior approval. No remittances are permitted to Israel or South Africa. Authorized dealers may sell exchange or make remit- 4 The list consists mostly of raw materials and capital goods. PAKISTAN tances in accordance with the regulations. Certain remit- tances of a personal nature are subject to annual quotas, but applications in excess of the quotas may be approved at the discretion of the State Bank. Remittances by Pakistani nationals to their families abroad require special authorization. Payments for invisibles connected with imports are generally given the same treatment as that accorded to the underlying trade transaction. Except with respect to certain aid shipments, transport insurance must be taken out with insurance companies in Pakistan. Commissions, brokerage, or other trade charges paid to foreign importers or agents by Pakistani exporters are generally limited to a max imum of 5 percent of the invoice value, except for cotton, rice, and cement, for which separate regulations apply, and for engineering goods for which the maximum is 10 percent. The remittance of dividends declared out of current profits is allowed freely to foreign shareholders where the investment was made with the Government's approval. With the approval of the State Bank, profits of branches of foreign companies and banks may be remitted to their head offices. The same applies to head office expenses charged to a branch's profit and loss account and accepted for tax purposes by the Pakistani income tax authorities. Authorized dealers may sell foreign exchange up to US$1,000 a person every two years for private travel irrespective of the number of days spent abroad;5 this allocation can be used in installments. In addition to this quota, each traveler is allowed US$50 a trip. Additional exchange for business travel, medical treatment, educa- tion, and sponsored cultural trips may be granted on an individual basis. Student maintenance and basic allow- ances for study abroad range from US$8,200 a year; the maximum for actual tuition is US$7,500 a year, and other one-time allowances are US$1,350. Student allowances can be drawn through authorized dealers without requiring State Bank approval. Allowances for professional training abroad range from US$750 a month for junior executives to US$1,200 a month for senior executives. There are also specific allowances for pilgrims' travel to Saudi Arabia. Exporters of goods with annual export earnings in excess of PRs 2.5 million and exporters of services in excess of PRs 0.25 million are entitled to a renewable one-year blanket permission for the purchase of travel tickets and travel exchange of US$150 a day up to US$4,500 for each business trip. Foreigners leaving Pakistan within six months from the date of their arrival in Pakistan may take out foreign currency not exceeding the amounts they brought in (including foreign currency notes up to the equivalent of US$500 a person, subject to a maximum of US$2,000 a family) and PRs 100 a person in Pakistan currency notes. Residents leaving for Afghanistan may take out any amount of Afghan currency. Nationals working abroad who visit Pakistan may retain for one year the foreign 5 The allowances for travel to India and Bangladesh are less; there is no such allowance for travel to Afghanistan. 375 ©International Monetary Fund.

When leaving Pakistan within one year from the date of arrival, they may take with them the unspent balance of foreign exchange (including foreign currency notes up to the equivalent of US$500 a person, subject to a maximum of US$2,000 a family). Larger amounts of foreign currency notes can be taken out if the currency notes were declared on entry. Residents traveling to other foreign destinations may take out PRs 100 a person in Pakistan currency and any amount in foreign currency notes and traveler's checks sold by authorized banks under general authority delegated to them or under permission issued by the State Bank. Foreigners may make family remittances of up to 50 percent of net income or US$750 a mon th, whichever is higher. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of specified commodities to any destination and all exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited.6 Exports of most other commodities are allowed freely. However, certain specified exports are subject to export quotas (for example, maize, gram, camels, split gram, and cotton yarn), quality controls (such as batteries, electric bulbs and appliances, and oil cakes), or m in imum export prices (such as hand-knotted carpets up to 96 knots and certain varieties of onyx blocks). The CECP is responsible for the export of cotton, although the private sector is also permitted to participate in export trade. Cotton is also exported to India without the involvement of any public sector agency; non-Basmati rice is exported through the RECP (exports of rice are allowed by the private sector under brand names in packings of ten); and cement through the State Cement Corporation. Chemical fertilizers also can be exported by the private sector units. Goods consigned to India can be exported only by public sector agencies. The State Bank requires a declaration by the exporter that payment will be received in accordance with the prescribed method and within the prescribed period of time except for goods manufactured in the export pro- cessing zones. The authorized dealer certifies the export form for shipment. Exporters are obliged to collect and surrender export proceeds within four months of ship- men t, although the State Bank may allow an extension of this period. Exporters may, however, with the prior approval of the State Bank, grant deferred payment terms. The surrender of Afghan currency accruing from exports to Afghanistan is not required. Export financing at concessional rates is provided for all exports, with the exception of 24 specified items7 based 6 Prohibited exports include ferrous and nonferrous metals (exc lud ing iron and steel manufactured goods), edible oils, grains, dairy produc ts, animal fats, beef, mu t ton, timber, certain hides and skins, pulses and beans, wet-blue leather made from cowhides and calfhides, wheat bran, wheat straw, and charcoal. 7 The exceptions are: raw cotton; cotton yarn; fish other than frozen and preserved; mu t ton and beef; petroleum products; crude vegetable material; wool and animal hair; crude animal material; feeds tuff for animals; all grains including grain flour; stone, sand, and gravel; waste and scrap of all k inds; fertilizer crude; oilseeds, nu ts, and kerne ls; jewe lry 376 on irrevocable letters of credit or firm export orders on a case-by-case basis under Part I of the Export Finance Scheme,8 or, alternatively, on the basis of the previous year's export performance of the exporter as advance limit on a revolving basis under Part II of the scheme. A rebate of 55 percent is available against the tax payable on income attributable to the sales proceeds from exports of goods manufactured in Pakistan. Industrial units established under the PAYE scheme are permitted to utilize up to 50 percent of the f.o.b. value of exports for the servicing of suppliers' credit on imports of plant and machinery. Export duties are levied on staple cotton, oil cakes, molasses, semitanned hides and skins, crushed bones, and onyx blocks. Proceeds from Invisibles With the exception of Afghan currency, which may be retained, incoming foreign exchange derived from invis- ibles must be surrendered within three months. Travelers may bring in PRs 100 in Pakistan currency notes a person and PRs 5 in coin that is legal tender in India. There is no limitation on the import of other currency notes and coin. Capital Inves tmen ts in Pakistan by nonresidents are subject to approval. In order to encourage industrial development in Pakistan, the Government follows a liberal policy toward foreign entrepreneurs, who, with the approval of the Governmen t, may start any indus try in the private sector without conditions being laid down regarding the participation of local capital. It is expected, however, that local rupee expenditures will ordinarily be met from local equity capital. Repatriation facilities are as follows: (1) Foreign capital invested in approved industries established after Septem- ber 1, 1954 may be repatriated at any time to the extent of the original inves tmen t, and current profits may be transferred without restriction to the country of origin of the capital. (2) Profits reinvested in approved industrial projects with the sanction of the Government may be treated as inves tment for the purpose of subsequent repatriation.

These repatriation facilities do not apply to the purchase of shares on the stock exchange, unless the purchase is an integral part of an approved inves tment project, or to capital invested in Pakistan before September 1, 1954.

Not for Redistribution Foreign nationals in Pakistan or abroad may register their inves tmen ts in National Prize Bonds issued by the Government of Pakistan; the principal in such transactions can be repatriated at any time, but the prize funds are treated as savings for the purpose of exchange control regulations on outward transfers. Transfers of capital abroad by resident nationals are, in general, not permitted; the purchase of foreign secu- rities by Pakistani residents requires approval by the State Bank. Detailed rules govern the transfer of capital by persons emigrating or retiring from Pakistan, depending upon the nationality of the person concerned and the coun try to which the transfer is to be made. Foreign nationals temporarily residing in Pakistan are treated as nonresidents for purposes of transfer of securities. Gen- eral permission has been given in connection w i th the issue, sale, or transfer of Pakistan securities, in favor of nonresident Pakistanis, provided that the securities are registered at the address in Pakistan of the purchaser and investment is made on the basis of nonrepatriation of capital and re turn. Pakistani securities held by nonresident foreign nationals may be transferred to other nonresident foreign nationals against paymen ts abroad, subject to the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the transferor. A general permission has also been issued allowing foreign nationals temporarily resident in Pakistan to make inves tmen ts in un i ts of the National Inves tment Trust, subject to certain stipulations. General permission has been granted to public limited companies whose shares are quoted on stock exchanges in Pakistan to transfer shares to nonresident Pakistanis, provided: (1) payment is made by remittance of foreign currency from abroad; (2) the shares are registered at the address in Pakistan of the buye r; and (3) the buyer gives an under- taking that he will not apply for remittance of dividend or sale proceeds of the share. Exports of securities are subject to approval. Proceeds accruing from the liquidation of nonresident capital assets that are not covered by repatriation arrangements must be credited to blocked accounts. Subject to approval by the State Bank, balances in blocked accounts may be invested in approved government securities payable in Pakistan rupees or placed as time deposits with banks. Foreign banks functioning in Pakistan can underwr i te share issues of companies incorporated in Pakistan in association with the Inves tment Corporation of Pakistan, subject to the stipulation that the total value of shares so underwritten by them in each issue does not exceed 10 percent of the capital offered to the general public for subscription. The foreign banks may also underwrite public issues of participation term certificates, term fi- nance certificates, and modaraba certificates without any restriction, subject to the stipulation that where terms and conditions of issue of such securities grant the option to the holders to convert the securities into ordinary shares, the restriction of 10 percent of the total capital offered to the general public would also apply. A general permission allows Pakistani nationals resident abroad to invest in new public share offers in Pakistan PAKISTAN by remittance of foreign exchange or by debiting their foreign currency accounts in Pakistan; dividends or in- terest thereon, as well as the proceeds upon sale, may be transferred abroad, provided that these securities were held for no less than one year. Pakistani nationals require the prior approval of the State Bank to sell movable or immovable assets held abroad, and the liquidation pro- ceeds must be repatriated to Pakistan through normal banking channels. Gold The export and import of gold are prohibited unless authorized by the State Bank. Such permission is normally not granted. However, under a special scheme, jewelry manufacturers are allowed to import gold for the purpose of manufacturing jewelry for export. Banks incorporated in Pakistan are not permitted to engage in purchases or sales of bullion whether in or outside Pakistan. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement April 25. While maintaining the same spot rate (buying) at PRs 17.30 per US$1, the State Bank of Pakistan changed the spot rate (selling) and forward rates with authorized dealers as follows: (In Pakistani rupees) Buying Per U.S. Spot Forward up to 6 mon ths 17.3000 17.2844 17.3000 17.3000 Selling Per U.S. Forward up to 6 months 17.3312 17.6460 Spot 17.3156 17.3865 To April 24, 1987 From April 25, 1987 To April 24, 1987 From April 25, 1987 Dollar Forward up to 12 months 16.7810 Dollar Forward up to 12 months 17.9055 Subsequent changes took place in line with changes in the spot buy ing and selling rates. May 5. The exchange risk coverage fee on private sector foreign currency loans inclusive of suppliers' cred- its and guaranteed loans under the PAYE scheme was changed from 3 percent to rates based on the difference between the interest rate in Pakistan and the interest rate payable on the loan. July 14. The annual rates of the exchange risk coverage fee for direct borrowing in the private sector inclusive of suppliers' credits, guaranteed loans, and PAYE loans were revised. The revised rates were 3.75 percent for U.S. dollar loans, 7.06 percent for deutsche mark loans, 3.00 percent for pounds sterling loans, 7.75 percent for Swiss franc loans, and 7.60 percent for Japanese yen loans. Some of these rates were revised monthly thereafter. 377 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PAKISTAN December 5.

To facilitate having bilateral agreements with tea-exporting countries, 70 percent of tea imports would be imported through TCP. Thirty percent would be allowed in the private sector, provided not more than one third is imported from a single source. July 1. The IPO for 1987/88-1989/90 was introduced and included many changes while retaining the same structure. Changes included (1) the removal of 136 items, categories, or subcategories from the negative list to be freely importable; major categories or subcategories lib- eralized included wrought iron plates and sheets, rayon yarn, tires and tubes, chemicals, and other raw materials; (2) the transfer of 3 items from the negative list to one of the restricted lists (including nonwoven fabric and steel balls up to 1 mm diameter); and (3) the addition of 7 categories of engineering goods to the negative list (types ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution of boilers, pumps, cranes, machinery for sugar manufac- turing and refining, diesel generators, distribution trans- formers, and switch gear) from either the restricted lists, or from the freely importable items. With the granting of advance licenses to industrial un i ts, the distinction be- tween recognized and unrecognized industrial units was dropped. The ceilings on the value of imports of machinery were relaxed for commercial imports (from PRs 4 million to PRs 10 million), and for some new units and for expansion of existing units. The list of specified industries that require government agency sanction for new units or expansion of existing units was reduced. The value limit for licenses for units, excluding the textile industry, was raised from PRs 5 million to PRs 10 million. July I. Duty-free cotton yarn imports were allowed. July 1. The import license fee was increased from 2 percent to 4 percent. Payments for Invisibles January 17. Detailed regulations were issued for proc- essing hajj applications by Pakistani pilgrims under the sponsorship scheme for hajj.

This scheme is in addition to that providing travel costs from domestic services for a limited number of pilgrims. August 30. With effect from March 1, foreign exchange allowances for studies abroad were increased. Mainte- nance and basic allowances were increased to US$8,200 a year, with a 5 percent escalation for maintenance charges in subsequent years; the maximum for actual tuition fees was set at US$9,500 a year, and other one-time allowances were increased to US$1,350. Exports and Export Proceeds June 6.

In addition, this facility was made available without any limit in cases where the goods were exported through normal trading channels under prescribed export documents. July 1. Quotas were imposed on the export of cotton yarn. An export duty of PRs 5 per kilogram (about 12 percent on an ad valorem basis) was imposed on cotton yarn exports. July 1. It was announced that a scheme would be devised linking income tax relief to export value added. July 1. The scheme for granting drawbacks of import duty and sales tax that exporters pay on their raw materials was extended. Drawbacks were henceforth also given for the Iqra surcharge of 5 percent, the import surcharge of 5 percent, and the import license fee of 4 percent. August 4. The re-export of imported goods was allowed, but only for freely importable items. Export licenses would be issued only if the export f.o.b.

Not for Redistribution PANAMA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Panama is the Panamanian Balboa, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar at B 1 = US$1. The U.S. dollar is legal tender and circulates freely in Panama; locally issued currency is represented by balboa coins and several commemorative coins. Commercial banks quote buying and selling rates for certain other currencies based on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On November 26, 1946 Panama notified the Fund that it accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Most import and export licenses are issued by the Price Regulation Office, a semiautonomous institution of the Panamanian Government. The Price Regulation Office is responsible for the implementation of restrictions on imports of commodities that compete with national pro- duction and on certain exports. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry determines the import quotas for commod- ities listed in trade agreements; the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, jointly with the Price Reg- ulation Office, determines the import quotas for certain agricultural commodities. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Imports and Import Payments Import quotas are maintained on some 20 products, including oil, timber, salt, fishmeal, milk, and sugar. Some of these are not licensed. Import licensing applies to some products subject to quotas and to imports of various foodstuffs. Imports by the public sector are subject to special requirements. Payments abroad may be made freely. In addition to import du ty, a tax of 7.5 percent of the f.o.b. value is levied on private sector imports of all dutiable goods other than specified pharmaceutical prod- ucts and foodstuffs, for which the rate is 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively; books are exempt. Most imports are also subject to a tax of 5 percent calculated on the sum of the c.i.f. value and all other import taxes and charges; among the exemptions are fue ls, lubricants, and related products, as well as foodstuffs, specified medicinal and pharmaceutical products, and imports into the Free Zone. Exports and Export Proceeds Export taxes are levied on gold, silver, platinum, manganese, and other minerals, sugar, bananas, coconuts, scrap metals, pearls, animal wax, nispero gum, ipecac root, and rubber. Exports of certain foodstuffs, firearms, and ammunition are prohibited. Certain nontraditional exports are eligible for tax credit certificates. The proceeds of exports are not subject to exchange control. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for and proceeds from invisibles are not restricted. A travel tax of 4 percent is levied on air and sea tickets bought in Panama or on such tickets purchased for travelers starting their trip in Panama. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. A significant number of foreign-controlled banks are authorized to conduct business only with nonresidents. Gold Panama has issued two commemorative gold coins with face values of B 100 and B 500, which are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may freely hold gold in any form, at home or abroad, and may freely negotiate gold in any form with residents or nonresidents, at home and abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry carried as personal effects by travelers are subject to license if made by residents other than the monetary authorities; import licenses are issued freely by the Ministry of Commerce and Indus try, and export licenses are granted by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. Exports of unworked gold produced in Panama are subject to an export du ty of 1 percent ad valorem, and exports of gold coin (other than U.S. coins, which are exempt) are subject to a du ty of 0.5 percent.

Not for Redistribution PAPUA NEW GUINEA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Papua New Guinea is the Papua New Guinea Kina. The exchange rate of the kina in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is adjusted daily on the basis of its relationship to a weighted basket of currencies representing Papua New Guinea's major trading partners. On December 31,1987 the official buying and selling rates quoted by the Bank of Papua New Guinea for the U.S. dollar were US$1.1393 and US$1.1375, respectively, per K 1. The commercial banks, the only authorized foreign exchange dealers, publish rates for all current transactions with their customers, w i th in a max- imum spread of 2 percent between buy ing and selling. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Papua New Guinea formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from December 4, 1975. Administration of Control Foreign exchange control is administered by the Bank of Papua New Guinea under the Central Banking (Foreign Exchange and Gold) Regulations, Chapter 138. Overall policy is determined by the Government with the advice of the Bank of Papua New Guinea and the M in is try of Finance. The Bank of Papua New Guinea has delegated considerable powers to the commercial banks operating in Papua New Guinea, which have been appointed au- thorized dealers in foreign exchange and gold. Export licensing is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Prescription of Currency Contractual commitments, which are expressed in a foreign currency, to persons resident outside Papua New Guinea must be met by paymen ts in foreign currency.1 Export proceeds may be received in any foreign currency or in kina from an overseas bank's account in Papua New Guinea. Nonresident Accounts The Bank of Papua New Guinea controls all credits to nonresident bank accounts; funds credited to such ac- counts may be withdrawn without fu r ther formality. Only in exceptional circumstances is approval given for a nonresident bank account to be denominated in a foreign currency. Imports and Import Payments Imports of a limited number of goods are restricted for health, security, and protective reasons. Imports of a number of items, including canned meat, eggs (into the 1 Foreign currencies are defined as all currencies other than the kina. mainland only), sugar, chicken, and pork are prohibited. Certain items, including laundry bar soap, plywood, and fresh fru i ts and vegetables, are subject to quotas for reasons of domestic protection; quotas are adjusted quar- terly, reflecting the extent to which local production can meet domestic demand. Quotas are typically imposed for three-year periods, and quota allocations are made on a pro rata basis with purchases of domestically produced goods. There are no import licensing requirements. Authorized dealers have the authority to approve most transactions without referring to the Bank of Papua New Guinea. Normally, import payments must be settled within 90 days of the arrival of goods in the country; approval for payment on extended credit terms is usually given for items such as capital goods. The tariff regime consists of the following: (1) duty free for main essential items, including food staples (rice, tinned meat, and fish) and medical supplies; (2) 7.5 percent for basic goods, including some consumer goods and raw materials; (3) 25 percent for intermediate goods, including goods with satisfactory domestic substitutes; and (4) 50 percent for luxury goods, including television sets, jewelry, cosmetics, cameras, video recorders, and nonessential food and beverage items. Payments for Invisibles Approval is readily given for most payments for invis- ibles, provided that supporting documentation can be produced. The remittance overseas of life insurance premiums on new policies written after December 31, 1975 in the names of permanent residents is not permitted. Applications for foreign exchange for foreign travel in excess of the equivalent of K 4,000 an adult and K 1,500 a minor a year for tourist travel and K 2,000 for each business trip are referred to the Bank of Papua New Guinea for consideration. Travelers may not take or send out of Papua New Guinea domestic currency in excess of K 200 in notes and K 5 in coin; however, domestic coins issued for numismatic purposes may be taken out freely. Overseas visitors are free to take out any currency which they brought in and recorded on arrival. Exports and Export Proceeds Residents of Papua New Guinea may export goods without exchange control formality on condition that they comply with the terms of the general authority issued by the Bank of Papua New Guinea. The essential conditions of this authority are that payment for goods exported is received within six months of the date of export and that the proceeds are sold to an authorized dealer in Papua New Guinea. When exporters are not in a position to comply with the conditions of the general authority, they must apply to the Bank for a specific authority. No authority is needed for certain categories of goods, in- 381 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PAPUA NEW GUINEA eluding sundry items such as passengers' personal effects. Export licenses are required for all types of goods under the Exports (Control and Valuation) Act. Special provi- sions are in force for the export of prescribed goods (logs, pearls, tuna fish, and wood chips). Specified commodities are subject to export levies. Proceeds from Invisibles Approval is required only for the disposal of foreign currency proceeds other than by sale to an authorized dealer in Papua New Guinea. Overseas visitors may bring in any amount of currency for travel expenditure. Capital Outward transfers of overseas-owned capital are nor- mally allowed; advance commitments, however, are given only in exceptional circumstances. New investment out- side Papua New Guinea by permanent residents and by companies and other organizations operating in Papua New Guinea is subject to certain limitations. When an investment is for portfolio reasons, the amount that may be invested in a 12-month period is limited to K 10,000 a person. Investment may only be in the form of marketable company securities and real estate. The approval of the Bank of Papua New Guinea is needed for the acquisition and disposal of foreign securities by permanent residents.2 Persons who have been declared to be temporary residents by an authorized dealer or the Bank of Papua New Guinea may repatriate their surplus earnings without limit. Prior clearance from the tax authorities may be required for these transactions. Approval by the Bank of Papua New Guinea is required for all new or increased foreign investment in Papua New 2 Foreign securities are defined in the Central Banking Act as including deposits in overseas bank accounts and debts due by persons outside Papua New Guinea. Guinea. In some cases the Bank of Papua New Guinea refers such applications to the Ministry of Finance. Foreign investments other than those in banking and insurance are also subject to approval by the National Investment and Development Authority. Approval from the Bank of Papua New Guinea is also necessary for the acknowledgment of indebtedness, so that the right to receive a payment may be conferred on a nonresident. Offshore borrowing by private sector entities in Papua New Guinea may not exceed the debt/equity ratio of 3:1. Commercial banks may undertake offshore borrowing for on-lending to exporters, provided that no assumption of exchange risk is involved. Gold Under the Central Banking (Foreign Exchange and Gold) Regulations, Chapter 138, approval by the Bank of Papua New Guinea is necessary for the sale, purchase, export, and import of gold. On January 1, 1987 royalties and withholding tax payable on sales of alluvial gold were removed and replaced with a 5 percent ad valorem export tax, and dealings in this type of gold were freely permitted. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payment January 2. Under the 1987 budget, the tariff structure was simplified by limiting the number of tariff schedules to four. The maximum rate of duty was reduced to 50 percent, except for a number of goods, such as tobacco and alcohol products, motor vehicles, and petroleum products, for which special duties would continue to apply. The general import levy of 7.5 percent was abol- ished. Government agencies were required to pay duties on their imports as from January 1, 1988, and importers who were previously exempted from du ty payments were required to pay them and then submit claims for refund. 382 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PARAGUAY (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Paraguay is the Paraguayan Guarani. The exchange arrangement consists of five d ifferent ex- change rates, four of which are fixed by the Central Bank of Paraguay; the fifth fluctuates freely and is used by commercial banks and exchange houses. The rates fixed by the Central Bank (in terms of U.S. dollars) are the following: (3 240 per US$1 for imports of major public enterprises;(S320 per US$1 for public sector external debt service transactions; (3 400 per US$1 for imports of petroleum products and nonfactor service payments by public enterprises; and(S550 per US$1 for disbursements of new official borrowing, surrender of export proceeds at the m in imum prices set by the Central Bank, and imports of agricultural products. All other transactions (i.e., export proceeds in excess of the m in imum price, certain binational transactions, and most non-oil import payments, profit remittances, and private service pay- ments) are channeled through the free exchange market. On December 31, 1987 the average rate prevailing in this market was around (S 870 per US$1. A tax of 1.5 percent is levied on purchases and sales of foreign exchange in the official market, except for transactions with foreign embassies and diplomats, meat packing plants, and those relating to inves tmen ts in Paraguay under the terms of Inves tment Law No. 550/ 75. A fee of 2 percent is levied on sales of foreign exchange for imports. In addition, banks charge a com- mission of 2 percent on all sales of foreign exchange and receive a commission of 1 percent on all sales of foreign exchange to the Central Bank. The Central Bank in turn charges a commission of 1 percent on all sales of foreign exchange to the commercial banks that are authorized to operate in the exchange market. Additional selling rates result from the application of a 10 percent tax on outward remittances of profits and dividends and a 30 percent tax on outward remittances of interest, royalties, ren t, honoraria, commissions, and other income accruing to nonresidents from Paraguayan sources. For interest payments on foreign loans con- tracted by national banks, the tax is applied only to the spread if floating-rate loans are involved and to 6.5 percent of interest on fixed-rate loans. The authorized commercial banks are required to transfer all of their daily gross foreign exchange receipts at the four controlled exchange rates to the Central Bank, and are required to report their daily transactions to the Central Bank. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk. Administration of Control The Central Bank determines foreign exchange policy and supervises, together with the Superintendency of Banks, the foreign exchange transactions carried out by the banks and the exchange houses. Arrears are main- tained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Payments between Paraguay and Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uru- guay, and Venezuela are made through accounts main- tained with the Central Bank of Paraguay and the other central banks concerned within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Inte- gration Association (LAIA). Clearing takes place every four months, but Paraguay, as a relatively less developed country, may request special settlement every two months. There are no other prescription of currency requirements. Imports and Import Payments Imports of certain commodities require authorization. These include: table wine in bulk, natural grape must concentrate, rice in the husk or with any degree of processing, gasoline, diesel oil, gas oil, kerosene, wire, nails, dry cell batteries, and potatoes, garlic, and onions during local harvest seasons. Imports of petroleum and petroleum products may only be made through the na- tional petroleum company, PETROPAR . Imports of wheat and wheat flour, when necessary, are made by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. All importers are required to be registered at the Central Bank. All imports are subject to a m in imum financing term of 120 days. Commercial banks are instructed not to establish letters of credit for importers unless these importers already have, from their own resources, the foreign exchange necessary to settle these external obligations. Taxes ranging from 5 percent to 70 percent are levied on most imports depending on the customs specifications, which are based on the Brussels Nonemclature. Taxes are collected by the banks at the time of delivery of documents for customs clearance or when the import payment is made, whichever is earlier. The following are the principal import items exempt from surcharges: im- ports for religious, charitable, cultural, or educational purposes; imports for the Government; furniture acquired through inheritance; all imports exempted according to international treaties; and the accompanied baggage of international passengers or nationals returning to establish residence in Paraguay. Also exempted are agricultural and industrial machinery and equipment imported through the Spanish free zone in Paraguay; agricultural machinery and equipment for the National Wheat Program; books and periodicals; and imports under Investment Law No. 550/75. Imports of investment goods and of new material for export industries are eligible for exemption on a case- by-case basis. Commodities originating from neighboring countries are subject to a lower 10 percent surcharge on the c.i.f. value; this applies to foodstuffs, textiles, foot- wear, and other manufactured consumer goods.

Not for Redistribution PARAGUAY powered automobiles, tractors, and motorcycles are sub- ject to only 60 percent of the surcharge established for vehicles with equivalent specifications using other fue ls. The 1985 tariff law temporarily prohibited a wide range of imports that would compete directly with Paraguayan products. Imports of a number of commodities that might jeopardize national security, public order, or public health are also prohibited. The Ministry of Finance is entitled to lift import restrictions on basic foods tuffs, seeds, and cement when domestic production shortfalls are such that domestic demand cannot be met through internal supply. Imports of specified goods (including television sets and precious metals) may not be financed with foreign credit. Imports on credit for a term of more than six mon ths require approval from the Central Bank; such approval is normally granted only for imports of machinery and other capital goods. Import payments must be made through banks at the official rates of exchange or at the rate prevailing in the parallel market. For certain commodities originating in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Uruguay, and falling under the regional trade regime, import paymen ts need not be channeled through banks; as long as proof of payment of the preferential tariff rates for these imports can be presented, payments may be effected with the importer's own foreign exchange. Import invoices are subject to preshipment inspection by international agencies. Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles are settled at the free market rate, with the exception of central government transactions, and some transactions of the binational entities (which are settled at either (3 550 per US$1 for central government service payments, or (S 320 per US$1 for government debt service transactions, and <& 550 per US$1 for some transactions of the binational entities). Travelers may take out any amount in foreign or domestic currency. There is an ad valorem sales tax of 5 percent on international airline tickets. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of logs and rough beams and some other unprocessed forest products are prohibited, as are exports of rawhides, horses, wild animals, sheep, goats, pigs, and rabbits. At present, beef exports are not subject to annual export quotas. Certain other exports require prior au- thorization in order to ensure adequate supplies for domestic consumption and to meet the needs of domestic industries. All other exports are free from licensing requirements, but some require a certificate issued by the National Ins t i tu te of Technology and Standardization of the Ministry of Indus t ry and Commerce, and others require a certificate issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. All exporters are required to be registered at the Central Bank. The proceeds of exports must be collected w i th in 120 days after completion of the banking formalities related to the shipping documents; the foreign exchange proceeds must be converted and surrendered at banks 384 authorized to engage in foreign exchange transactions at the exchange rate for the respective commodity. For all products, the Central Bank establishes m in imum export prices denominated in U .S. dollars. Exporters of these commodities are required to surrender, in the official exchange market, all the foreign exchange proceeds from their exports, which may not be less than the amount corresponding to the m in imum price set by the Central Bank. Advance receipts of export proceeds must also be sold to authorized banks. All exports are exempted from taxes or charges. Export invoices are subject to preship- ment inspection by international agencies. Proceeds from Invisibles Except for foreign exchange inflows from the binational entities (which have to be transferred in full to the Central Bank), there are no surrender requirements for proceeds from invisibles. Travelers may bring in any amount in foreign or domestic currency. Capital All inward and outward transfers must be channeled through the authorized banks or exchange houses. As a provisional measure the Central Bank limits annual sales of foreign exchange for the amortization of private sector debt to no more than 10 percent of the originally registered external liability. Repatriation of earnings of enterprises and commercial banks is allowed through the free ex- change market. Under Inves tment Law No. 550/75, the Government can grant special tax, customs, and import surcharge concessions to proposed investments, provided that these are duly registered and approved. Capital imported and registered under this law may be retrans- ferred in the currency originally imported in installments of up to 20 percent from the third year after the beginning of production. Gold Under Decree Law No. 18/52, the Central Bank may prescribe the max imum amount of gold (and foreign exchange) that may be held by residents; this requirement does not apply to amounts held by the Central Bank or by institutions authorized to deal in foreign currencies. In practice, residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, in Paraguay or abroad, and exchange houses may freely deal in gold coins, gold bars, and gold leaf with residents and nonresidents. Exports and imports of gold by nonbank residents and industrial users in any form other than jewelry require the prior approval of the Central Bank; paymen ts for gold imports by industrial users must be made through authorized banks at the free market rate.

PARAGUAY 385 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PERU (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Peru is the Peruvian Inti. The exchange system involves two exchange markets —the official mar- ket (MUC) and the market for bank certificates of deposit (CD) denominated in foreign currency (CBME). In the MUC, the exchange rate for the inti is pegged to the U.S. dollar and determined by the Central Reserve Bank. The CBME rate is market-determined. On December 31, 1987 the average buying-selling rate in the MUC was I/. 33 = US$1, and the rate in the CBME was I/. 62.8 = US$1. Exchange transactions may be conducted in 14 currencies other than the U.S. dollar,1 on the basis of their exchange rates in terms of the U.S. dollar in the international market. Surrender of export proceeds and foreign exchange purchases for merchandise imports take place at various premia or discounts from the MUC rate. Currently, there are two distinct effective exchange rates for exports: a premium of 21.1 percent over MUC for traditional exports (mainly minerals, petroleum, and fishmeal); and a pre- mium of 27.3 percent over MUC for nontraditional ex- ports. There are effectively six separate rates for mer- chandise imports: a discount of 51.7 percent from MUC for imports of basic foods, basic medicines, and inputs for producing basic medicines; a discount of 39.4 percent from MUC for imports of other medicines and essential agricultural inputs; a discount of 24.2 percent from MUC for imports of live cattle and high-priority food items; the MUC rate for imports of essential inputs for indus try, tractors, and parts for land transportation equipment; a premium of 36.4 percent for imports of essential capital goods, nonessential inputs for agriculture and indus try that compete with domestic products, defense material, and other priority consumer goods; and the CBME rate for all other imports. Invisibles and capital transactions take place at four different rates, ranging from the MUC rate to the CBME rate. Remittances of foreign exchange for selected service payments were suspended for two years starting July 29, 1986. All exchange transactions must be conducted through the banking system. An exchange tax of 1 percent is levied on foreign exchange proceeds from exports of goods and services, and on purchases of foreign exchange for imports of goods and services. Banks and dealers operating in the MUC are required to limit the spread between their buying and selling rates on any given day to not more than 0.5 percent (excluding the spread arising from the 1 percent exchange tax). Commercial banks may 1 Belgian francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs for external trade transactions; for nontrade transactions, operations may also be effected in Austrian schillings, Canadian dollars, Norwegian kroner, Swedish kronor, and Venezuelan bolivares. 386 charge a commission of 0.25 percent on transactions, and the Central Reserve Bank charges a commission of 0.06 percent on transactions in the CBME market. Enterprises are not allowed to hold abroad their foreign exchange receipts with limited exceptions, and must sell foreign exchange to the banking system within ten working days of receipt. Export proceeds, including loans for the prefinancing of exports, and other loan proceeds must be surrendered to the Central Reserve Bank. The Central Reserve Bank issues ten-day foreign exchange certificates against surrender of proceeds of exports or their prefi- nancing, which may be used either for making payments through the official market, provided that the payments are at an exchange rate equal to or more depreciated than the one applying to the export transaction generating the exchange, or redeemed for intis at the exchange rate applicable at the date of redemption. If held to maturity, the Central Bank will apply a 2 percent discount to the value of the certificate before making the redemption. Exporters of nontraditional products availing them- selves of subsidized credit from the Fund for Nontradi- tional Exports (PENT) are eligible for 180-day nontrans- ferable exchange certificates (PENT certificates) against the surrender of foreign exchange proceeds of preship- ment and postshipment credits received from abroad, provided that such foreign credits do not exceed 72 percent of the contemplated export value. Extensions of up to 360 additional days in the validity period of the certificates are permitted. PENT certificates remain in the custody of the Central Reserve Bank and bear interest at LIBOR, plus 5 percentage points for the duration of the foreign export financing; they are applied directly by the Central Reserve Bank for the cancellation of part of the PENT credit to the exporter. Upon surrender of export proceeds, the Central Reserve Bank issues a second set of exchange certificates for the direct cancellation of the PENT credit not covered by PENT certificates. Foreign currency bank accounts in the Peruvian finan- cial system are prohibited with limited exceptions; these cover official ins t i tu t ions, financial organizations, certain firms engaged in international imports, or persons spe- cially authorized by the Central Reserve Bank. Peruvian residents are required to convert into intis all foreign currency held abroad. The bank ing system issues U.S. dollar-denominated certificates of deposit to individuals against foreign exchange from tourism or unregistered transactions. These certificates may be used to pay for approved imports. Alternatively, they may be sold for in t is at the daily auction held at the Central Reserve Bank or redeemed for intis at ma tu r i ty at the exchange rate prevailing in the auction on the ma tur i ty date. Peru formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement as from February 15, 1961. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Administration of Control Export licenses are issued by the General Directorate of Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Indus try, Commerce, Tourism, and Integration. Import and foreign exchange licenses are issued by the Central Reserve Bank. In addition, prior Central Reserve Bank approval is required for payments for nonfactor services. The Import Super- vision Commission is the ultimate administrative authority on applications for prior import licenses denied at a lower level and rules on the exclusion of importers from the National Register of Importers. It also exercises general surveillance over the flow of imports and their effects on domestic production and is empowered to make recom- mendations to the Import Valuation Commission. The latter Commission exercises surveillance over customs valuation and has the authority to purchase and auction off, or to impose special duties on, those imports deemed to be undervalued or dumped. Public sector imports valued at more than US$10,000 require the approval of the Board for External Transactions of the Public Sector and must be registered with the General Directorate of Foreign Trade. Public sector imports valued at more than US$50,000 require, in addition, a resolution of the Min- istry of Indus try, Commerce, Tourism, and Integration. Borrowing abroad by the public sector, as well as borrowing abroad by the private sector with a government guarantee, is subject to prior approval by Supreme De- cree, on the recommendation of the Committee of the External Debt and the National Planning Institute. Public enterprises are required to register their short-term in- debtedness with the General Directorate of Public Credit (GDPC) and to obtain GDPC's approval for renewal, rollover, or consolidation of such debt. Moreover, with effect from January 1983, the enterprises must submit their annual short-term borrowing programs to GDPC for approval. The National Commission on Inves tment and Foreign Technology (CONITE) supervises foreign direct investment in Peru and the use of foreign trademarks, patents, and licenses, as well as the related royalty payments. Most payments for invisibles require the ap- proval of CONITE. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency All exchange market operations must be effected in one of the 15 prescribed convertible currencies, but exchange certificates may be issued by the Central Re- serve Bank only in U.S. dollars. Payments between Peru and Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru and the other central banks concerned, within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Imports and Import Payments Import prohibitions apply to 541 commodities out of the approximately 5,300 eight-digit items of the Peruvian PERU customs nomenclature (NABAND INA ). These commodities include agricultural products, footwear, textiles, and se- curity-related materials. With the exception of imports valued at US$2,000 or less a year, a set of 1,574 items specified by the General Directorate of Foreign Trade is importable only subject to prior approval (observation) from the appropriate ministry; they include items subject to public sector monopoly or deemed in need of protection or damaging to public welfare. Importers must be listed in the National Register of Importers. An import license for imports from countries of the Andean Pact is not required, nor is the listing of the importer in the National Register of Importers; the imports need only be registered with the General Directorate of Foreign Trade. Imports of raw materials and intermediate goods for the production of nontraditional exports are exempted from import duties, and a specific import license is not required, provided that the appropriate ministry determines that such imports qualify under the Temporary Admission Regime. Certain industrial raw materials and fertilizers, as well as certain agricultural commodities, such as milk powder, may be imported only by the National Enterprise for Input Marketing (ENCI); and crude petroleum and petro- leum derivatives, only by PETROPERU, a state-owned enterprise. Imports of capital goods must be covered by irrevocable documentary credits, and the intermediating bank must guarantee refunding of the foreign currency if the import is not effected by the time the relevant documentary credit expires. Advance payments are permitted except for capital goods imported by firms with an annual turnover in excess of I/. 10 billion. With specified exemptions, imported goods are subject to a uniform value-added tax of 11 percent of the c.i.f. value of imports (in addition to the import duty); exemp- tions from the value-added tax include agricultural prod- ucts, certain minerals and fuels, medicines, fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural equipment and tractors, aviation equipment and ships in excess of 1,000 tons, and items for personal use (including automobiles up to 2,000 cubic centimeters). In addition, a selective consumption tax (also in addition to the import duty) is levied on luxury items, ranging from 18 percent to 145 percent of the c.i.f. value. The maximum import duty is 120 percent ad valorem, and the unweighted average rate is 66 percent.2 In addition, many imports are subject to one or both of the following taxes: (1) an additional import tax for the promotion of nontraditional exports of 1 percent of the c.i.f. value, and (2) a maritime freight tax of 10 percent of the ocean freight charges. However, certain goods originating in Andean Pact countries may be imported duty free. Public sector imports must, in principle, be shipped in Peruvian vessels.

Not for Redistribution PERU for foreign exchange in either the official market or the CBME. Remittances of foreign exchange for debt service payments on private sector debt, dividends, profits (in- cluding depreciation allowances), royalties, patent fees, and technical assistance fees by enterprises operating in Peru were suspended for two years starting July 29, 1986. Dividends and royalties of petroleum and mineral com- panies, the servicing of short-term trade credits, short- term working capital loans that were contracted before July 28, 1985, and the servicing of medium- and long- term debt contracted after July 28, 1986 are excluded from the suspension. The Ministry of Economy and Finance has the authority to determine other exceptions to the suspension. Payment of the national currency equivalent of amortization and interest payments on medium- and long-term loans and other credits affected by the suspension is required to be made to the Central Reserve Bank on the dates that payments fall due. Remittances of net profits, including depletion and depreciation allowances that are exempted from suspen- sion, require approval of CONITE and a prior tax clearance. In accordance with Andean Pact rules, the remittance of profits on foreign capital invested in Peru is, in principle, limited to 20 percent a year, although a higher percentage may be permitted for investments that generate employ- men t, are situated in undeveloped areas, or help to diversify exports.3 All payments for royalties, patents, trademarks, and licenses require the prior approval of CONITE. Foreign-owned enterprises may not enter into new contracts to pay royalties to a foreign parent company or its affiliates. The maximum interest rate on a new loan from a foreign parent company or its affiliate may not exceed by more than 3 percent the prevailing interest rate for first-class assets in the money market of the country in whose currency the transaction is conducted. Foreign investment by petroleum and mining companies is subject to special contracts with the Peruvian Government. The sale of foreign exchange for business travel abroad, other than official business, is limited to US$220 a person a day of travel up to a maximum of US$4,400 a trip to North America and Europe; US$250 a person a day of travel, up to a maximum of US$5,000 a trip to Asia; and US$150 a person a day up to a maximum of US$3,000 a trip to other countries. Expenditures on tourist travel abroad are limited to US$2,000 or its equivalent in other currencies a person a calendar year and must be paid for through the acquisition of U.S. dollar certificates of deposit (CBME). The purchase of foreign exchange for tourist travel is subject to a tax equivalent to US$100. Approval by the Foreign Exchange Committee of the Central Reserve Bank is required for purchases of foreign exchange for payments that have not been considered by the exchange regulations. Indicative limits on foreign exchange sales are established in some cases. The Central Reserve Bank, through its Foreign Exchange Committee, 3 Companies exporting at least 80 percent of their production to countries outside the Andean Pact and mining companies are exempt. 388 may authorize purchases of exchange in excess of the specified limits in justified cases. Exports and Export Proceeds Export prohibitions apply to 60 items, mainly rare wildlife or plants. Export licenses are required in 50 other cases. The Banco Minero del Peru is the principal exporter of uncut precious stones and pearls, and MINPECO has a monopoly over exports of silver and other refined metals produced by the public enterprises; the Banco Minero has a monopoly over gold exports; and (since August 1985) PETROPERU has a monopoly over exports of petro- leum derivatives. Exports of certain commodities speci- fied by the General Directorate of Foreign Trade are subject to prior license. All export proceeds as well as export prefinancing loans must be surrendered to the Central Reserve Bank within five working days of ex- pected date of receipt. Traditional exports must be sold against an irrevocable letter of credit confirmed by a bank established in Peru. In special cases, and with the au- thorization of the Central Reserve Bank and the General Directorate of Foreign Trade, exports may be sold against sight drafts, provided that payment is received within 180 days of shipment. Exporters of most nontraditional products are granted transferable tax credit certificates (certificados de rein- tegro tributario, or CERTEX) equivalent to a maximum of 30 percent of the f.o.b. value. An additional 10 percent is allowed for exports from outside the Lima-Callao area. Exports of local handicrafts recognized as such by the General Directorate of Foreign Trade are eligible for CERTEX benef i ts at a rate of 35 percent. CERTEX certifi- cates may be used by the exporter in payment of his tax obligations or may be sold to other taxpayers, who may use them for the same purpose. The Export Credit Insurance Company of Peru (SECREX) administers an export credit guarantee program, and the Central Reserve Bank (since December 1983) provides or arranges export finance for nontraditional exports. To be eligible for the incentives granted for nontraditional exports, exporters must be listed in the Register of Enterprises Exporting Nontraditional Products; each entry in the list is valid for two years. Most traditional exports are subject to a tax of 5 percent or 10 percent, which is payable in intis, but exports of copper, lead, zinc, silver, gold, t in, and tungsten are exempt when the international price is below a specified level. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be sold to the banking system within ten working days of receipt. Capital Outward capital transfers require approval. For trans- fers derived from foreign direct inves tmen t, the approval of CONITE is required; for most other transfers, the appropriate agency is the Central Reserve Bank. M in imum maturities and grace periods for different categories of external loans contracted or guaranteed by the public ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution sector have been established. Furthermore, annual global limits are established on the contracting of new public or publicly guaranteed external debt (with certain excep- tions) having an original ma tur i ty of more than one but less than ten years. Loan amortization paymen ts of the private sector are authorized by the Central Reserve Bank, and those of the public sector, by the General Directorate of Public Credit. Debt service payments on private sector debt are suspended for a two-year period starting July 29, 1986, subject to certain exceptions (see section on Payments for Invisibles, above). There is a limit on the servicing of external public debt equivalent to 10 percent of receipts from exports of goods and services. This limitation does not apply to the servicing of short-term debt, reserve liabilities, debts owed to the governments of Latin American countries and regional organizations, paymen ts in k ind, or debts incurred since July 29, 1985. Within the overall limit, debt-service payments are made only to those creditors from whom net inflows are expected. Short-term trade credits with banks that have not signed a refinancing agreement are to be rolled over on maturity until signature of agreement. Local currency funds for the servicing of these debts are to be placed on deposit in special accounts at the Central Reserve Bank on the maturity date of the original obligation. With the permis- sion of the Central Bank, funds in these special accounts may be lent out domestically as loans denominated in foreign currency, with a maturity of less than one year. Service payments on public sector short-term debt to national or foreign banks are authorized only if matched by a loan from such creditors to Banco de la Nacion or COFIDE for an amount at least as large as the repayment, and conforming with specified conditions. In compliance with the foreign investment regime approved by the countries of the Andean Pact, new foreign investments must be authorized and registered with the appropriate agency, in most instances, CONITE, so that such investments are directed to projects consid- ered essential for the coun try's development. If a foreign company incorporated in Peru as of July 1, 1971 wishes to benefit from the duty-free program of the Cartagena Agreement, it was required to have agreed by June 30, 1974 to the gradual acquisition by national investors of shares in the company, so as to transform it into a mixed or national company during a maximum period of 15 years following the entering into effect of this regime. For this purpose, mixed companies are defined as those in which national investors hold between 51 percent and 80 percent of the capital, and national companies are those in which at least 80 percent of the capital is owned by national investors. Since June 30, 1974 the required participation of national investors in the capital of an enterprise has been not less than 15 percent; this partic- ipation must be raised to at least 45 percent after 10 years and to at least 51 percent at the end of the 15-year period. For foreign companies established in Peru after June 30, 1971, the 15 percent participation by national investors must be secured at the time of the initiation of production. PERU Foreign investments in firms engaged in basic industries or in mining activities (including petroleum production) and in firms that export at least 80 percent of their production to countries outside the Andean Common Market are exempt from the requirement of gradual transformation into mixed companies; however, these enterprises do not benefit from the duty-free program of the Cartagena Agreement. Foreign enterprises may have access to short-term domestic credit in amounts not greater than their capital and reserves. Investment in the mining sector is governed by the General Mining Law. Companies holding mining conces- sions may enter into mining contracts with the Govern- ment providing for special incentives and guarantees or may constitute mixed enterprises with government par- ticipation of at least 25 percent. The Government may grant to mining concessionaries (initiating large-scale investment programs) tax incentives and guaranteed avail- ability of foreign exchange for transfers for (1) recovery of investment; (2) interest payments if the rate does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar loans in the financial market from which the loans originate; (3) payments for justified services; and (4) reasonable profit remittances, together with guaranteed access to the most favorable exchange rate. Mixed mining enterprises may receive all the benefits and incentives that may be granted by special contract and, in addition, special tax reductions. Gold Export of gold in the form of precious metals is the monopoly of the Banco Minero del Peru. The authorities do not make foreign exchange available for imports of gold other than by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and authorized industrial and professional users. Domes- tic sales and purchases of gold may be carried out by industrial and professional users, provided that they hold licenses issued by the Banco Minero del Peru, but only MINPECO is authorized to make the initial purchase of newly mined gold and other precious metals. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 3. The conversion of receipts from engineering and consulting services was shifted to the exchange rate for nontraditional exports (110 percent of the financial market rate). January 20. The surrender requirement in the MUC for proceeds from cotton exports was lowered from 65 percent to 25 percent (with the remainder to be converted at the financial market rate). February 11. Payments and remittances related to international air travel were shifted from the MUC rate to a rate equivalent to 120 percent of the financial market rate. February 14. Most nonfinancial service transactions still in the MUC were transferred to the financial market. February 20. Export surrender requirements in the MUC were lowered from 90 percent to 55 percent for hydrocarbons, from 45 percent to 35 percent for exports 389 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PERU from small mines, and from 65 percent to 55 percent for exports from large mines. February 27. Export prefinancing under the PENT was shifted to the financial market. April 3. A special exchange premium was established for the conversion of private capital into intis for specified direct investments in Peru. Capital repatriated for this purpose was to be converted at the "free" financial market rate, and subsequently was to receive a premium of 7.5 percent after the repatriation and a further 7.5 percent after 18 months. April 4. Conversion of U.S. dollar-denominated depos- its in the Peruvian banking system, with amounts not exceeding US$5,000 as of July 31, 1985, was authorized at the free market rate, provided that the proceeds are invested in exchange rate indexed deposits for at least one year. Also, the facility under which foreign exchange could be purchased in the free official financial market up to a limit of US$10,000 a quarter was abolished. In its place, a limit of US$4,500 a year was established for purchases of foreign exchange for foreign travel in the free market. June 1. Private entities were authorized to purchase up to US$4,500 a year without restrictions at the free financial rate through the commercial banking system. July 29. A devaluation of the inti and restructuring of the exchange system were implemented. For conversion of export receipts, the weighted average devaluation of the inti in terms of the U.S. dollar was about 9 percent, and the number of distinct exchange rates was increased from five to seven; the previously announced monthly rate of devaluation of 2.2 percent would continue to be applied for the remainder of the year to exchange rates for traditional exports. For imports, the weighted average devaluation was about 21 percent, and the number of fixed exchange rates was increased from two to three; these rates were to remain fixed for the remainder of the year. In addition, any approved imports could be paid for with CBMEs to avoid delays in obtaining foreign exchange from the Central Revenue Bank, resulting in an additional rate for imports, which is market-deter- mined. Most nonmerchandise transactions were to take place at one of the three exchange rates applicable to merchandise imports. All foreign exchange held in Peru or abroad was required to be converted into intis or dollar-indexed certificates of deposit, and foreign currency bank deposits were declared illegal. Dealing in foreign exchange was limited to the financial system. July 31. The exchange rates in inti terms applicable to conversion of export receipts were devalued by amounts ranging from between 0.5 percent to 2.7 percent. A new U.S. dollar CD rate, to be determined by auction at the Central Reserve Bank, was established. This rate was to be applicable to conversion of foreign currency bank deposits (including previously blocked U.S. dollar CDs), as well as to receipts from tourism and payments for unlicensed transactions. October 26. A devaluation of the inti and minor restruc- turing of the exchange system were implemented. The 390 inti was devalued on average by about 25 percent; the number of distinct exchange rates applicable to exports was reduced from seven to three, and the number of rates applicable to imports, including the CBME rate, was increased from four to five. December 14. A devaluation of the inti and restructuring of the exchange system were implemented. The inti was devalued on average by about 34 percent; the number of distinct exchange rates applicable to exports was reduced from three to two, and the number of rates applicable to imports was reduced from five to four. Payments for nonpriority imports were directed to the CBME market. There was also some reclassification of invisibles and capital transactions among exchange rate categories. The Central Bank also announced that during 1988 the ex- change rates applying to exports and imports of goods would be adjusted on a monthly basis by the percentage change in the wholesale price index of the previous month or, in the absence of timely information, by 85 percent of the percentage change in the consumer price index in the previous month. December 21. Two new exchange rate categories were created for merchandise imports, both involving discounts from the MUC rate. Imports and Import Payments January 14. A 180-day minimum financing requirement was established for capital goods imports, accounting for about 10 percent of total imports. February 17. A foreign exchange licensing system was established for all public and private sector imports (except private donations), under which importers are required to obtain prior approval to purchase foreign exchange. June 1. It was announced that automatic approval would be granted for the importation of capital goods for export industries, up to a limit of US$3,000 per transaction and US$30,000 per year. July 15. The foreign exchange and import licensing systems for goods were un if ied. July 29. Importers of licensed or approved goods and services were authorized to make payments with U.S. dollar CDs rather than waiting to purchase foreign ex- change from the Central Bank. Payments for Invisibles April 3. A requirement of prior approval by the Central Reserve Bank for all payments for nonfinancial services was established. Capital April 3. A special exchange premium was established for the conversion of private capital into intis for specified direct investments in Peru. Capital repatriated for this purpose was to be converted at the free financial market rate, and subsequently was to receive a premium of 7.5 percent after the repatriation and a further 7.5 percent after 18 months. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PHILIPPINES (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Philippines is the Philippine Peso. The authorities of the Philippines do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and exchange rates are determined on the basis of demand and supply in the exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary in order to maintain orderly conditions in the exchange market and in light of their other policy objectives in the medium term. On December 31, 1987 the official rate was P 20.8 per US$1. The spot buying and selling margins are determined on a competitive basis for all transactions under the general jurisdiction of the Bankers' Association of the Philippines. The Central Bank is not governed by the trading rules of the Bankers' Association of the Philippines in making its own purchases and sales of foreign exchange. Interbank trading takes place on-floor at the Foreign Exchange Trading Center (FOREX) from 4:30 p .m. through 5:00 p .m. daily. Off-floor interbank trading is prohibited. The Central Bank from time to time acts as a buyer or as a supplier on the trading floor. Under the Private Corporate Sector Foreign Currency Debt Repayment Program administered by the Central Bank Foreign Exchange Cover Corporation (CBFEC), corporate debtors and their foreign creditors are provided with options for arranging repayments and rescheduling, with forward exchange cover provided when required. To be eligible for the program, debt must have original maturities falling due between October 17, 1983 and December 31, 1986. The CBFEC provides forward cover for debts, provided that a rescheduling agreement between debtor and creditor has been concluded. The CBFEC enters into a forward contract with the debtor, whereby the debtor would pay to the CBFEC peso amounts equivalent to the rescheduled maturities converted at the exchange rate prevailing on the date that the eligible debt was effectively entered into the program, plus quarterly fees equal to the product of the current domestic interest rate and the peso value of the outstanding debt; and the CBFEC would deliver the foreign exchange to make the rescheduled principal and interest payments to the creditor. Alternatively, the CBFEC would extend a national peso loan to the borrower equal to the peso equivalent of the debt in question, converted at the exchange rate prevailing on the date that the debt was effectively entered into the program, provided that the debtor has agreed with the creditor to a rescheduling for at least seven years, with a grace period of at least three years. Subject to CBFEC's receipt from the debtor of the service payments on this national peso loan, the CBFEC would remit the service payments on the foreign loan directly to the creditor on behalf of the borrower, the foreign loan having been assumed into the restructured debt of the Central Bank. Administration of Control Exchange regulations are administered by the Central Bank on the basis of policy decisions reached by the Monetary Board. Certain new foreign direct or portfolio investments in the Philippines require the prior approval of the Board of Investments (BOI). In addition to commercial banks (KBS), thrift banks, rural banks, and the tourist-oriented establishments are authorized by the Central Bank to deal in foreign ex- change; subject to certain conditions, they may purchase foreign currencies from tourists and other specified non- residents for conversion into pesos. Corporations, part- nerships, or single proprietorships registered with the Department of Tourism may accept foreign exchange in payment of goods sold or services rendered. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements for outgoing payments, but all exchange proceeds from ex- ports and invisibles must be obtained in prescribed cur- rencies.1 Most payments and transfers to South Africa are prohibited. Authorized agent banks and foreign ex- change dealers are authorized to accept notes denomi- nated in Saudi Arabian riyals, Kuwaiti dinars, and Bahrain dinars for conversion into pesos. Nonresident Accounts Bank accounts denominated in pesos may be opened in the names of nonresidents, whether individual or corporate, without the prior approval of the Central Bank. Nonresident accounts may be credited only with the proceeds from inward remittances of foreign exchange or convertible foreign currencies and with peso income from, or peso proceeds of, conversion of properties (real or personal) located in the Philippines and belonging to nonresidents. Nonresident accounts may be freely debited for peso withdrawals. Withdrawals from nonresident accounts for transfer abroad are subject to individual application with supporting evidence and to established limits where applicable, such as in the case of emigrants. Subject to authorization, both residents and nonresi- dents may maintain foreign currency accounts with au- thorized agent banks in the Philippines (see section on Proceeds from Invisibles, below). Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. All mer- chandise imports are allowed, except for certain com- modities that are regulated or restricted for reasons, inter alia, of public health, national security, international 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Brunei dollars, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Indonesian rupiahs, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, Swiss francs, Thai bant, and U.S. dollars. 391 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PHILIPPINES commitments, and development and rationalization of local industries. Imports are at present classified into freely importable commodities, prohibited, banned, regulated, or liberalized commodities. The first group comprises commodities that are freely importable and that may be given due course by authorized agent banks (AABs) without prior approval of the Central Bank. Prohibited commodities are com- modities whose importation is prohibited, such as those originating from South Africa, onions, potatoes, garlic, cabbages (except for seedling purposes), coffee, used clothing and rags, and toy guns. The third category — banned commodities—consists of those for which impor- tation requires prior Central Bank approval. These are further classified into nonessential consumer (NEC) and unclassified consumer (UC) goods. Regulated commodity imports are defined as commodities that require clearances and permits from various government agencies but do not need prior Central Bank approval before importation. Finally, liberalized commodities are those that were formerly banned but may now be imported without prior Central Bank approval. Sales of foreign exchange for imports of commodities that are classified under the two categories of consumer goods—UC and NEC —are subject to prior approval of the Central Bank, and the opening of letters of credit for such imports must be reported to the Central Bank within 24 hours. Payments for imports of certain other com- modities (wheat, raw cotton, and leaf tobacco) are per- mitted only if they are financed through certain official credit arrangements. Imports on a consignment basis require prior Central Bank approval. All importations of machinery, equipment, and spare parts for agriculture and for export-oriented enterprises registered with the Central Bank, BOI, and Export Processing Zone Au- thority (EPZA) may be given due course by AABs without prior approval of the Central Bank or favorable endorse- ment from concerned government agencies, except those falling under "other regulated imports." Importations of regulated capital goods financed through foreign credits must be referred to the Central Bank for prior approval. Prior approval for imports of machinery and capital equipment by the Board of Investment is required for certain local content and "progressive" manufacturing programs. Trade with any of the state-trading countries, excluding Yugoslavia, must be effected through the Philippine International Trading Corporation. As a method of payment, commodities may be imported against letters of credit, on a document against acceptance (D/A) basis, or under open account (O/A) arrangements. The use of the D/A and O/A procedures is restricted to oil firms, export-oriented companies certified or registered by the Central Bank, the Board of Inves tmen t, the Garments and Textile Export Board, and the EPZA, exporters of semiconductor devices, exporters of gar- ments and footwear, franchised public utility concerns, participants in the Progressive Car Manufacturing Pro- gram, Progressive Export Program for Consumer Elec- 392 tronics Products, Progressive Diesel Manufacturing Pro- gram, and Progressive Motorcycle Program, and accredited participants in the BOI Pulp and Paper Indus try Ration- alization Program. The use of these procedures by pro- ducer firms is normally restricted to commodities in the Essential Producer Goods category. Unless arrangements are made for such terms of credit, imports in excess of US$1,000 must be covered by letters of credit opened on or before the day of shipment and are subject to the release certificate requirement. Imports financed by the importer's own foreign exchange or not involving pay- ments from the Philippines (i.e., "no-dollar" imports) are allowed, subject to prescribed conditions, and are exempt from the requirement of opening letters of credit. The reserve requirement on marginal deposit on all import letters of credit is 100 percent. At the request of an authorized agent bank or other financial institution, a firm may be "watch-listed" by the Central Bank for arrears on its loan repayment commit- ments. A watch-listed firm may not open import letters of credit without the approval of the Central Bank, which will allow the opening of letters of credit only after a schedule for the repayment of overdue obligations has been agreed upon. Certain authorized agent banks require 50 percent deposit against the opening of letters of credit for such firms, compared with 25 percent in normal cases. There are separate regulations for imports into border regions by barter traders. Payments for Invisibles Virtually all payments to South Africa are prohibited. In principle, all other payments are permitted, with prior approval of the Central Bank, provided that amounts of more than US$100 are substantiated by documentary evidence. However, there are certain limits established by the Central Bank for purchases of foreign exchange for travel abroad by residents, remittances for educational expenses, maintenance and expenses of dependents of residents while abroad, remittances of profits, dividends, and interest, royalties, and for film and other rentals (see below). Foreign exchange allowance for travel abroad is limited to the following amounts: (1) for both business and nonbusiness travel, irrespective of duration, up to a maximum of US$3,000 for the United States, Canada, South America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and New Zealand (Area I); (2) for both business and nonbusiness travel, irrespective of duration, up to a max imum of US$1,000 for Hong Kong, Taiwan Province of China,t the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and other countries not included in the coverage of the area under (1) (Area II); (3) for travelers under 21 years of age, up to a maximum of US$500, irrespective of duration and destination; and (4) for overseas contract workers with prearranged employ- men t, up to a max imum of US$100. Applications for travel abroad for a fifth or subsequent time within one calendar year are subject to careful review by the agent t See Explanatory No te on Coverage of Part Two, page 61. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution banks to prevent abuse. A foreign tourist holding a visa valid for up to 59 days may remit abroad up to the equivalent of US$1,000 against payment in another foreign currency brought in by the tourist; beyond this amoun t, approval must be obtained from the Central Bank. The following limits apply to exchange for educational expenses abroad for students undertaking bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree courses at duly accredited colleges or universities. The allowances are divided ac- cording to the areas in which the study is undertaken: living allowances are provided up to US$500 per month in Area I and US$350 per month in Area II; books and supplies allowances up to US$500 per year in both areas; clothing allowance up to US$500 per year in Area I and US$300 per year in Area II; other miscellaneous school expenses are allowed up to US$500 per year in Area I and US$300 per year in Area II. Any scholarship allow- ances are deducted from these amounts. High school students may be granted foreign exchange for education only under an exchange program and under the following conditions: the maximum travel funds per student is US$500, and the maximum clothing allowance and inci- dental expenses during the stay abroad is US$500, or US$1,000 a student a calendar year. The limits on remittances to dependents of residents are as follows: US$250 a mon th for each dependent living in Area I as defined above, and US$150 a month for each dependent living in Area II. The maintenance allowances for dependents are granted only for close relatives under conditions prescribed by the Central Bank. Remittances of profits and dividends (net of taxes) accruing to nonresidents out of net profits realized after October 14, 1984 are permitted in fu l l, provided that remittances are not financed from domestic borrowings. Remittances of royalties or rentals on patents, trademarks, and copyrights accruing after October 14, 1984 are freely permitted (net of taxes) for contracts registered with the Central Bank or the Technology Transfer Board, provided that contracts do not exceed five-year terms and do not include restrictions on the export of the product. Remit- tances of the producer's share of earnings (net of taxes) made on motion-picture film and rentals on television film are freely permitted, provided generally that the shares or rentals do not exceed 60 percent of net proceeds from films. Notwithstanding other provisions, however, all unserviced eligible nontrade, nonloan remittances (e.g., dividends, profits, royalties, lease paymen ts, fees, com- missions, etc.) earned and which became due and payable before October 15, 1984 and in arrears of transfers as of that date shall not be serviced without prior Central Bank approval. Dividends of current income arising from equity in- vestments in nonpriority sectors made in connection with the program for the conversion of external debt into equity investments may not be transferred during the first four years after the investment is made; thereafter, such dividends and current income may be transferred. Foreign exchange w i th in the limits established above may be purchased from authorized agent banks, with the PHILIPPINES prior approval of the Central Bank. Applications for payments for certain invisibles for which no basic allow- ance has been set are considered on their merits by the Central Bank. No person may take out or export from the Philippines foreign currency or any other foreign exchange except as authorized by the Central Bank. Residents may take out, as part of their travel allowance, up to US$1,000 in foreign bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out any amount of foreign currency that they had previously brought in and declared, less any amounts converted into pesos. Resident and nonresident travelers require prior authorization from the Central Bank to take out more than P 500 in domestic bank notes and coin or checks, money orders, and other bills of exchange drawn in pesos. When traveling abroad, citizens of the Philippines must pay a travel tax of P 2,700 for first-class passage and P 1,620 for economy-class passage. Reduced rates of P 1,350 for first-class passengers and P 810 for economy- class passengers are provided for groups of people trav- eling for recognized special purposes. Reduced rates of P 400 for first-class passengers and P 300 for economy- class passengers are provided for dependents of contract workers du ly registered with the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA). Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of certain strategic materials and items deemed essential for industrialization and economic development are also pro- hibited. Otherwise, exports are generally not restricted but are regulated to ensure that the foreign exchange proceeds are surrendered to an authorized agent of the Central Bank. Export proceeds must be received in 18 designated currencies. Authorized agent banks issue the necessary export permits upon registration of the ex- porter's report of foreign sales (except export permits for gold, which are issued by the Central Bank); reports of foreign sales of copra, coconut oil, and sugar-based commodities, however, are approved for registration only by the Central Bank. Registration of sales of sugar-based commodities requires prior clearance by the Department of Trade and Industry. As a general rule, no commodity may be exported unless it is covered by a draft drawn in one of the prescribed currencies (see footnote 1) and unless collec- tion of the proceeds will be undertaken by an authorized agent bank; however, payment by means of telegraphic transfer, check, or mail transfer may be allowed. Pay- ments for exports on a cash, collection, or consignment basis must be arranged through an authorized agent bank, which must specifically contract with the exporter to buy the exchange proceeds. No shipment of exports will be allowed by customs unless a certificate is issued by a bank stating that payment has been received or arranged. Export proceeds must be received in a prescribed cur- rency within 60 days from the date of shipment (or within such period as may be established in special cases) and surrendered to the agent bank within 3 business days of 393 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PHILIPPINES receipt. The undrawn balances of exports involving initial drawings of less than 100 percent of the f.o.b. invoice value must be collected and repatriated within 150 days from the date of shipment for exports to Europe, Africa, and Latin America, and 120 days from date of shipment for exports to other countries. An irrevocable letter of credit is required for all exports of scrap metals, copra, and coconut oil, and for all exports to Guam, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Japan. Exports of perishable commodities to Hong Kong require prepayment. An export tax is levied on logs. Export trade with state-trading countries, excluding Yugoslavia, is handled through the Philippine Interna- tional Trading Corporation. There are separate regulations for exports from border regions by barter traders. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be sold within three business days to an authorized agent bank. Whenever the net foreign exchange receipts from invisibles amount to at least US$100,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies) for the calendar year immediately preceding, the firm may, upon application, be certified by the Central Bank as export-oriented and shall be entitled to retain a portion of its earnings in a special foreign currency deposit account with AABs for operating expenses abroad and other contingencies, equivalent to the average expenses in- curred during the preceding 3 months plus 10 percent of the gross foreign exchange receipts during the immediately preceding 12 months. Philippine nationals employed abroad are permitted to open U.S. dollar deposit accounts with authorized agent banks, in which they may retain any U.S. dollars they remit to the Philippines. To be eligible for credit to such accounts, earnings must be transferred through Philippine diplomatic establishments. Under a foreign currency deposit scheme, inward remittances of foreign currencies (including foreign bank notes, coins, and traveler's checks) by residents or nonresidents for deposit in numbered foreign currency accounts are allowed, provided that the remittances represent neither current earnings or income of residents nor payments by nonresidents pursuant to contractual obligations. Balances in such accounts are freely trans- ferable abroad. Philippine nationals working abroad are required to repatriate specified minimum shares of their foreign earnings, ranging from 50 percent to 80 percent. Travelers may freely bring in any amount of foreign currency and up to P 500 in domestic bank notes and coin and checks, money orders, and other bills of ex- change drawn in pesos, of which not more than P 50 may consist of Philippine coin. Peso-denominated gold coins issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines are exempt from these requirements. Capital Virtually ail payments and transfers to South Africa are prohibited. All inward and outward capital transfers, with the exception of certain banking operations and certain transactions related to financing of international 394 trade (see below), are subject to the prior and specific approval of the Central Bank. When applications for new inward foreign investments (in kind or in cash), as well as new foreign borrowings are reviewed, preference is given to projects approved by the BOI, to export-oriented industries, and to other (non-export-oriented) industries not using domestic credit resources. The law guarantees full repatriation of cash investments made after March 15, 1973 in export-oriented industries that have been certified by the Central Bank, in enterprises registered with the BOI, and in securities certified by the Central Bank and traded on the Manila and Makati Stock Ex- changes. As a m in imum, foreign investors must hold securities for at least 90 days before the proceeds become eligible for repatriation. Foreign companies are eligible to borrow pesos from domestic sources, provided they have a debt-equity ratio of 60:40 in high-priority sectors, 55:45 in medium-priority sectors, and 50:50 in low-priority sectors. Foreign direct cash investments made after March 15, 1973 and registered with the Central Bank are freely repatriable, except for inves tmen ts in domestic commer- cial banks, which, if made after March 31, 1973, are freely repatriable and if made before that date are repatriable according to the schedule specified under (4) in the following paragraph. There are restrictions on sales of foreign exchange for the repatriation of foreign direct cash investments made before March 16, 1973 and noncash investments made after March 15, 1973, depending on the category of industry where the investment is made, as follows: (1) investments in export-oriented industries certified by the Central Bank are repatriable in fu l l, but no annual in- stallment may exceed the applicant's share in the net foreign exchange earnings of the firm in the preceding year; (2) inves tmen ts in enterprises registered with the BOI, producing import substitutes or exports, are repa- triable in three equal annual installments starting one year after the liquidation of the inves tmen t, but no annual installment may exceed the total net foreign exchange earnings in the preceding year; (3) inves tmen ts in enter- prises registered with the BOI (not included in (2) above and not utilizing domestic credit resources) are repatriable in three equal annual installments starting one year after the liquidation of the inves tmen t; and (4) for investments in the remaining industries, repatriation is allowed ac- cording to the following schedule: for amounts of US$0.25 million or less, five equal annual installments after liqui- dation; for amounts within the range US$0.25-0.5 million, seven equal annual installments after liquidation; and for amounts of over US$0.5 million, nine equal annual in- stallments after liquidation. Approval and registration by the Central Bank are required for the assigned capital of branches of foreign banks to be eligible for profit remit- tances and capital repatriation. During the period between the sale of the investment and actual repatriation, the proceeds may be reinvested, subject to approval by the Central Bank, in government securities, in shares of stock ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution in BOI-registered industries, or in shares of stock in export-oriented industries certified by the Central Bank. Foreign direct inves tment is also permitted in connec- tion with the Program for the Conversion of Philippine External Debt into Equity Inves tmen ts. Under this pro- gram, most categories of external debt, including resched- uled debt, may be converted into equity inves tmen t. Such equity investments are subject to a fee and/or foreign exchange fund ing requirement that is less for preferred sectors (the export, agricultural, and certain social sec- tors) than for other sectors. For inves tmen ts in the priority sectors, capital repatriation is not permitted during the first three years after the inves tmen t, and during the fourth through eighth year, not more than 20 percent of the capital portion of the inves tment may be repaid in any one year; for inves tmen ts in other sectors, capital repatriation is not permitted during the first five years, and during the sixth through the ten th year, not more than 20 percent of the capital portion of the inves tment may be repaid in any one year. Without prior central bank approval, commercial banks may not receive credit from abroad other than credit arising from normal international trade transactions. They may, however, accept deposits in nine scheduled currencies2 from nonresidents of foreign nationality; such deposits are freely repatriable at the prevailing exchange rate and are exempt from the 35 percent withholding tax. Twenty- six domestic commercial banks and four local branches of foreign banks are licensed to operate in an expanded foreign currency deposit scheme; these foreign currency deposit unit banks (FCDUs) are empowered to borrow funds from international money markets for domestic on- lending. Nonbank residents may obtain suppliers' credits from abroad, provided that repayment terms are within the limits prescribed by the Central Bank. Maturities of long-term loans or repayment terms should.be as follows: (1) US$250,000 or less, three years; (2) over US$250,000 up to US$500,000, five years; (3) over US$500,000 up to US$3 million, seven years; and (4) over US$3 million, eight to ten years. Firms whose products are clearly destined for export, as well as firms earning foreign exchange and duly certified as belonging to other priority areas (food, energy, infrastructure, transport, and com- munication) with appropriate government agencies, may secure credits in excess of US$3 million with a m in imum repayment period of seven to eight years. Interest rates may not be more than 1.5 percent above the prime rate of the lending country. Applications are not approved if the proposed project expands capacity in an industry deemed to be overcrowded or for firms that are in arrears with government financial institutions. Any prospective borrowing equivalent to US$3 million or more must be submitted for inclusion in the Central Bank's programming of external credit resources. Sales of foreign exchange for amortization of loans are permitted in accordance with the terms of loan contracts approved by the Central 2 Canadian dollars, deutsche ma rk, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds s ter l ing, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. PHILIPPINES Bank. The same applies for loan contracts registered with the Central Bank prior to November 26, 1969. For those not falling under these two categories, prior approval by the Central Bank is required for sales of foreign exchange for repayment of loans. Emigrants may transfer up to US$5,000, subject to verification by the Central Bank. The remaining liquid assets may be withdrawn in five years beginning one year from emigration. Outward investment by resident persons, firms, or corporations requires prior approval of the Central Bank through the Foreign Exchange Operations and Invest- ments Department. Except as otherwise specifically au- thorized, resident persons, firms, or corporations may not enter into any contract or transaction that may involve settlement in foreign exchange, or involving any assets belonging to them expressed in foreign currencies or payable or deliverable abroad. This restriction also applies to contracts or transactions involving assets within the Philippines belonging to a nonresident person, firm, or corporation, and to their export or import. Detailed regulations are in force concerning transactions in secu- rities between residents and nonresidents. Twenty-three foreign banks have been authorized to operate offshore banking units in the Philippines. These units may engage in a wide range of foreign currency transactions with nonresidents and with other offshore units. Offshore banking units may open and maintain deposit accounts in pesos with domestic agent banks exclusively to meet administrative and other operating expenses and to pay to designated local beneficiaries of nonresident Filipinos the equivalent of foreign exchange remittances channeled through the offshore banking units' correspondent banks abroad. Offshore banking units may also sell inward remittances of foreign exchange to the Central Bank. The Omnibus Investments Code of 1987 (E.O. No. 226) guarantees all investors in enterprises registered with the BOI the right to repatriate their investments and to remit earnings thereon as well as sums needed to meet payments of principal and interest on foreign loans; they are also guaranteed freedom from expropriation and requisition. There are different arrangements for "pioneer invest- ments" and "preferred investments"; the former are granted certain incentives over and above those given to preferred investments. Normally, enterprises owned or controlled by foreign nationals are permitted to operate only in "pioneer areas of investment," and at least 60 percent of the outstanding voting capital stock of registered enterprises in "preferred areas of investment" must be owned by Philippine na- tionals. Under the Omnibus Investments Code, foreign in- vestments in new enterprises not registered under Book I (Investment with Incentives) must obtain prior authority from the BOI. Authority will be granted unless the proposed investment (1) would conflict with existing constitutional provisions and laws regulating the degree of required ownership by Philippine nationals in the enterprise; (2) would pose a clear and present danger of 395 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PHILIPPINES promoting monopolies or combinations in restraint of trade; (3) would be made in an enterprise engaged in an area adequately being exploited by Philippine nationals; (4) would conflict or be inconsistent with the Investment Priorities Plan in force at the time the investment is sought to be made; or (5) would not contribute to the sound and balanced development of the national economy on a self- sustaining basis. Investments in the form of foreign exchange or other assets actually transferred to the Philippines shall also be registered with the Central Bank. The BOI shall assess and appraise the value of such assets other than foreign exchange. Gold Producers of gold may be eligible for assistance under the Gold Industry Assistance Act, irrespective of whether the gold is a by-product or the principal or only product of their operations. The Central Bank purchases the entire output of the 19 domestic primary gold producers. The producers are paid in Philippine pesos on the basis of the latest London fixing price and the prevailing Philippine peso-U.S. dollar exchange rate. The gold so acquired is deemed to be part of official international reserves. Small gold panners are exempt from the scheme. Gold in any form other than jewelry may be imported only for industrial and artistic purposes, and any person desiring to import gold must secure a license from the appropriate department of the Central Bank. Various denominations of gold coins have been issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines as follows: a 1- Peso Paul VI coin (1970); a 1,000-Piso Ang Bagong Lipunan coin (1975); a 1,500-Piso IMF-IBRD coin (1976); the 1,500-Piso Ang Bagong Lipunan coins (1977 and 1978); a 5,000-Piso Ang Bagong Lipunan coin (1977); a 2,500- Piso Douglas Mac Arthur centenary coin (1980); and a 1,500-Piso Pope John Paul II coin (1981). Transactions in legal tender gold coins are governed by the provisions of Central Bank Circular No. 570, dated June 9, 1977. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users.

Not for Redistribution POLAND (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Poland is the Zloty (100 groszy = 1 zloty). The exchange rate between the zloty and the currencies of countries other than members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA),1 Albania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is determined on the basis of a weighted basket of currencies, each of which accounts for at least 1 percent of Poland's external current account settlements with the convertible currency area. The currency composition of the basket and the currency weights are defined on a monthly basis in light of current account transactions in convertible currency. The value of the zloty in terms of the basket is adjusted periodically, on the basis of the difference between foreign and domestic trade prices, and with a view to securing the profitability of the major exports.2 Following a depreciation against the U.S. dollar of the zloty of 19.5 percent in February 1987, a series of smaller but frequent exchange rate adjustments were made during April-December 1987, bringing the total depreciation in 1987 to 37 percent.3 The National Bank of Poland quotes exchange rates for the European Currency Unit (ECU), the SDR, and for the currencies of 29 countries4 considered market economies; although it does not deal in the notes and coins of a limited number5 of the currencies, it stands ready to effect transactions in all of them. Buying and selling rates are set with margins of 0.5 percent around the middle rate, except for notes and coins, for which the margins are 2 percent. Rates are generally set at least once a week, normally on Thursdays, to become effective when they are published on the following Monday. Rates for currencies other than the U.S. dollar are based on the quoted rate for the U.S. dollar and the dollar rates for the relevant currencies in international markets on the day the rates are set. The buying and selling rates for spot transactions in U.S. dollars on December 31, 1987 were Zl 313.961 and Zl 317.121 respectively, per US$1.6 1 The participants in the CMEA are Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and Viet Nam. 2 For these purposes, profitability is defined as having been achieved when the ratio of the export price of a particular commodity to its domestic price (both expressed in a common currency) is equal to or greater than un i ty. 3 On February 1, 1988 the value of the zloty for the U.S. dollar was changed from Zl 320 = US$1 to Zl 380 = US$1. 4 Australian dollar, Austrian schilling, Belgian franc, Canadian dollar, Danish krone, deutsche mark, Finnish markka, French franc, Greek drachma, Indian rupee, Italian lira, Iranian rial, Irish pound, Japanese yen, Kuwaiti dinar, Lebanese pound, Libyan dinar, Luxembourg franc, Netherlands guilder, Norwegian krone, pound sterling, Portuguese escudo, Saudi Arabian riyal, Spanish peseta, Swedish krona, Swiss franc, U.S. dollar, Turkish lira, and Yugoslav dinar. 5 Indian rupee, Iranian rial, Irish pound, Kuwaiti dinar, Libyan dinar, and Saudi Arabian riyal. 6 The buying and selling rates for spot transactions in U.S. dollars on February 1, 1988 were Zl 378.10 and Zl 381.90, respectively, per US$1. 398 There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of the currencies of market economies for normal business transactions, but a 200 percent surcharge is applied on the sale of such currencies to Polish tourists traveling abroad. The Council of Banks sets maximum allowable commissions and charges on foreign exchange transac- tions in line with international practice. These levies are paid in zlotys (foreign currency) by domestic (foreign) customers. Most of Poland's trade and financial settlements with CMEA member countries are effected in transferable rubles through the International Bank for Economic Cooperation (IBEC). The clearing ruble is used for most settlements with Albania and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and for some settlements with Kam- puchea and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. Of- ficial exchange rates for transferable and clearing rubles are set by the National Bank of Poland and published each Monday. Exchange rates for transferable and clear- ing rubles are set at the same level, and are adjusted periodically, with a view to ensuring the profitability of the major exports to the socialist countries. Following a step depreciation of 17.4 percent in February, 1987, further adjustments were made in 1987, bringing the cumulative depreciation for the whole year to 32 percent against the tranferable ruble.7 Buying and selling rates for transferable and clearing rubles are quoted with a spread of 0.5 percent around the middle rate. At the end of December 1987, the buying and selling rates for the zloty against transferable and clearing rubles were Zl 139.30 and Zl 140.70, respectively, per one ruble.8 The National Bank of Poland also quotes weekly exchange rates for the zloty against the currencies of other CMEA member countries, Albania, and the Dem- ocratic People's Republic of Korea. These rates are based on multilateral and supplemental bilateral agreements with the socialist partners, and are used for noncommer- cial settlements (e.g., diplomatic representation expenses, international travel, scholarships, etc.). Buying and selling rates (including for notes and coins) are set with margins of 0.5 percent around the middle rate. A 30 percent surcharge is applied on the sale of these currencies for private trips abroad; the rate of surcharges applicable to trips to Czechoslovakia and Hungary is 150 percent, and to other member countries of the CMEA, 50 percent. Administration of Control The authority to make basic changes in the Exchange Regulation Law lies with the Parliament (SEJM). Imple- menting regulations are promulgated by the Council of 7 On February 1, 1988 the exchange rate for the transferable ruble (TR) was changed from Zl 140 = TR1 to Zl 170 = TR1. 8 The buy ing and selling rates for the zloty against transferable and clearing rubles on February 1, 1988 were Zl 169.15 and Zl 170.85, respectively, per 1 ruble. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Ministers and the Ministers of Finance and Foreign Trade. The authority for the enforcement of the foreign exchange regulations rests with the Minister of Finance. The Min- ister of Finance exercises related functions mainly through the President of the National Bank of Poland. Foreign trade is a state monopoly. Only economic units authorized for this purpose by the Ministry of Foreign Trade (MFT) may effect exports and imports; units not so authorized must channel their imports and exports through authorized organizations. At the end of Decem- ber 31, 1987, 347 units were authorized to engage in foreign trade on a permanent basis, and 61 of these were specialized foreign trade organizations (FTOs). An FTO is generally authorized to trade in all goods, subject to the limitations of its charter and its rights as specified by the MFT. Except where an FTO trades in goods (such as coal) that are basic to the economy, no FTO has a monopoly in any one item. In addition to the FTOs, 286 economic units had specific trading rights at the end of December 31, 1987; 89 of these were major producing and servicing companies or were affiliated with such companies. Thirty-eight of the 286 units were legal entities, such as small-scale producers and cooperatives. The remainder were individual persons, of which 16 were foreign residents established in Poland. Subject to an appeal in the administrative courts, the MFT is empowered to withdraw the trading right of any unit that ceases to meet the conditions stipulated in that unit's trading authority. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries with which Poland has multilateral and bilateral payments agreements are made in the currencies and in accordance with the procedures set forth in those agreements.9 If there are no specific agreements, or if trade takes place outside the scope of the agreements, settlement is made in a convertible currency. Resident and Nonresident Accounts Resident Accounts Polish residents (natural persons) can hold foreign exchange in the form of currency, stocks, bonds, etc. Four types of foreign currency accounts are available: convertible currency accounts "A" and "N," foreign 9 At the end of December 1987, Poland had bilateral payments agree- ments with Albania, Bangladesh, Brazil, the People's Republic of China, Colombia, Ecuador, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Democratic Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, and Nepal. Poland also had trade agree- ments with bilateral payments features for certain commodities with Argentina, Bangladesh, Malta, Pakistan, and Yugoslavia. Except for bilateral agreements with Albania, the People's Republic of China, India, Democratic Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Nepal, settlements under bilateral agreements were in U.S. dollars. Settlements with the People's Republic of China were in Swiss francs; with India, in Indian rupees; with Nepal, in pounds sterling; and in clearing rubles with Albania, Democratic Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. POLAND exchange retention accounts "M," and socialist currency accounts "S." (1) Accounts ((A" can be freely credited with con- vertible currency brought or transferred from abroad and/ or deposited with a declaration of the sources of the funds (i.e., royalties, copyrights, gifts from nonresidents). Ac- count holders can use the funds freely to effect transfers abroad, to buy goods and services, to finance tourist travel abroad by them and their next of k in, to withdraw in the form of foreign exchange coupons for use in hard currency stores, and to effect gifts to family members. The funds on deposit cannot be used to effect settlements between individuals. Withdrawals in zlotys, converted at the prevailing exchange rate, are freely permitted. Inter- est, paid in foreign exchange, is earned at the following annual rates: (1) for accounts maintained in French francs, pounds sterling, and U.S. dollars, 4 percent on call deposits, 8, 9, and 10 percent, respectively, on one-, two-, and three-year term deposits; and (2) for accounts maintained in deutsche mark and Swiss francs, 3 percent on call deposits, 7, 8, and 9 percent, respectively, on one-, two-, and three-year term deposits. (2) Accounts "M," which came into effect on Janu- ary 1,1987, can be credited with foreign exchange retained ("ROD" accounts) against exports in convertible curren- cies.10 An enterprise's retention quota is determined individually by the MFT in consultation with the Ministry of Finance, and is based, inter alia, on the (convertible currency) import intensity of its production and the nature of the product. Account holders may use the funds freely to purchase production-related and investment goods imports from the convertible currency area, either for their own use or that of cooperating enterprises; to make certain specified debt service payments; to pay for patents; and to purchase goods produced domestically but destined for export (up to a specified global limit). The funds cannot be used for settlement between individuals, but they may be offered for sale at periodic auctions held by the Export Development Bank. The funds may not be used for business trips, publicity, and/or marketing ex- penses. Interest is paid in foreign exchange at the annual rates of 3, 4, and 5 percent, respectively, on one-, two-, and three-year deposits. (3) Accounts "N," which came into effect on April 1, 1985, can be freely credited with convertible currency without the requirement that the source of the funds be declared. Interest, paid in foreign exchange, is earned at the following annual rates: (1) for accounts maintained in 10 During 1982-86, claims on "ROD" accounts were not the property of the enterprise, except in the case of joint ventures incorporated under the 1986 Law on Companies with Foreign Capital Participation. It represented priority rights to purchase foreign exchange up to a specified proportion of the foreign exchange earned from an enterprise's sale of goods and services to the convertible currency area. Provision has been made for a similar priority rights scheme with respect to foreign exchange earnings in transferable rubles, but there have not yet been any accounts established under the scheme. Retention rights are also authorized for exports to bilateral payments agreement countries that are not members of the CMEA. In addition to the ROD accounts available to exporters of most commodities, there are a number of other retention schemes that apply to particular exports or exporters. 399 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution POLAND French francs, pounds sterling, and U.S. dollars, 3 per- cent; and (2) for accounts maintained in deutsche mark and Swiss francs, 2 percent. Funds on deposit in these accounts may not be transferred or used to finance travel abroad. However, after one year the funds on deposit are transferable to an individual's account "A." In all other respects, the modalities of an account "N" are identical to those of an account "A." (4) Accounts "S" can be freely credited with socialist country currencies derived from wages, property sales, inheritances, etc., and with transfers from other accounts "S." Funds in these accounts are freely transferable abroad (to other socialist countries) and may be freely withdrawn in any socialist country currency, with con- version effected at the national currency rates quoted by the National Bank of Poland. Deposits of call money earn interest at 3 percent a year, and one-year term deposits earn interest at 4.5 percent a year. Resident individuals and enterprises may hold foreign exchange accounts abroad with the express permission of the National Bank of Poland. Such permission is granted only on "proof of necessity." Nonresident Accounts Nonresident juridical and physical persons are free to keep both convertible currency and zloty accounts. (1) Nonresidents may maintain convertible currency accounts (accounts "C") at the National Bank of Poland, the Bank Handlowy, and the Bank PKO, S.A. These accounts can be credited with funds brought or transferred into Poland, with transfers from other accounts "C," and with convertible currency amounts legally acquired in Poland. Deposits are freely transferable abroad, and may be used for purchases from hard currency stores and gifts to residents. The funds earn interest in foreign currency. Interest rates on accounts "C" of physical persons are fixed by banks and are paid at an annual rate in the range of 3 percent to 5 percent for demand deposits, and 4 percent for term deposits (depending on the account currency, the time limit, and the rates on international money markets). Interest rates on accounts "C" of juridical persons are fixed at the same rates, except demand deposits, which do not earn interest. (2) Nonresidents are free to open and hold zloty ac- counts. Depositors may be asked to declare the source of the zlotys when making deposits into such accounts. This declaration requirement aims to ensure that payments into the accounts result from contracts or other operations that comply with the provisions of the foreign exchange law. Drawings on a zloty account require a foreign exchange permit, which is normally granted without restrictions for any internal disbursements. Apart from zloty s legally earned in Poland, these accounts may also be credited with foreign exchange converted to zlotys at the current exchange rate. Permits for conversion back to foreign exchange or for foreign exchange transfers abroad are normally granted. These accounts do not pay interest; however, nonresidents may also deposit their earnings on savings bank books, on which interest is paid. Deposits on zloty accounts may be transferred to other 400 nonresidents or residents. Such transfers require a foreign exchange permit, except gifts for residents. Permits for transfers to nonresidents are granted only for transfers to family members. Permits for transfers to residents are granted without any restriction. The Bank PKO, S.A. accepts deposits in convertible currencies, which are confirmed in the form of deposit certificates. The sources of the funds need not be declared. Interest payable in foreign currency after each six-month period is earned at the following annual rates: 3, 8, and 9 percent, respectively, on one-, two-, and three-year deposits. The deposit certificates are issued in U.S. dollars in denominations of US$100 and US$500. After one year, deposits confirmed in the form of deposit certificates may be transferred to an individual's account "A." Imports and Exports All imports and exports are subject to a licensing requirement. Licenses are issued by the MFT or by its "full-powers" agent employed by the economic unit applying for the license. The customs authority issues licenses not exceeding Zl 100,000 in value for gifts and souvenirs. Only economic un i ts with permanent trading rights are eligible to have an MFT licensing agent in residence. These agents issue licenses within the context of a "general authorization," which is granted to an economic unit by the MFT, remains valid until the end of the calendar year in which it is issued, and specifies the type and amount of the goods. General authorizations are not issued for certain goods or transactions, including those in the area of construction engineering and building technology, leasing apartments, imports utilizing foreign credit, and trade under barter agreements. The MFT must render its decision on the issuance of a general authori- zation within ten days after an application is filed. The same time limit applies to decisions on the granting of import and export licenses. For statistical purposes, the importation of services requires a license issued by the MFT. No fu r ther license from the foreign exchange authority is required for export or import and the per- formance or use of related services. Trade in certain goods is prohibited for social reasons under the penal code. General authorizations and licenses are readily granted at no cost, provided that the relevant regulations are observed and that the transactions are in line with national plan allocations. Contracts do not become valid, nor may payment orders be drawn, un t il a license has been issued, except for intergovernmental agreements and instanta- neous contracts, such as those made on a metals exchange. A license application must be filed with the appropriate authority within seven days after agreement on a contract is reached. A license remains valid until the final delivery date for the goods, or until the date of final payment; in specific cases, the validity period of a license may be extended. For data collection purposes, the economic unit must forward a general authorization and a license to the Foreign Trade Information Center within two days of their respective issuance; the documents are returned ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution to the units within ten days of their registration by the Center. On the basis of the registered documents and the utilization records that the units are required to keep, the customs administration monitors whether goods are traded according to valid documents. It also has the authority to inspect all relevant documents and to issue instructions for eliminating irregularities. In the event of changes in the contracted provisions, the economic unit must notify the relevant authorities (the MFT or its agent, and the Information Center) of the necessary changes in the license within seven days of receipt of the documentation, stating the reason for the changes. In the event of a change of more than 5 percent in the foreign currency price, or mistakes or errors in data, a new license must be issued, which automatically and simultaneously rescinds the former version. If a license is not fully utilized, the economic unit must declare this to the appropriate authorities within 14 days after confirmation of this fact. Such a declaration is not required if the underutilization amounts to less than Zl 50,000, or does not exceed 5 percent of the price or volume stated in the license. Settlement in foreign exchange is authorized and effected upon receipt, and according to the terms, of valid documents for settlement. There are no import quotas. The annual plan determines import needs by commodity groupings and value. These are balanced against financing according to priorities, with raw and intermediate products being the most im- portant. Foreign exchange allocation plans, which are prepared by the Planning Commission in consultation with the MFT, Ministry of Finance, and National Bank of Poland, are approved by the Council of Ministers on a semiannual basis. An Inter-Ministerial Committee meets every month to determine the distribution of available foreign exchange in light of this plan. Currently, about two thirds of convertible currency imports are financed centrally; these imports, largely intermediate products purchased in line with the needs of the annual plan, are distributed to the enterprises by the State. Enterprise "ROD" accounts currently finance about 25 percent of imports. A large portion of the remaining foreign exchange available for imports is allocated (under the control of branch ministries) for enterprise needs related to govern- ment contracts and operational programs. Separately, the branch ministries are in control of exchange for their own requirements. The residual is allocated to the relevant branch ministries for the import needs of the "nonprod- uction" sphere. In general, residents may import reasonable quantities of goods for noncommercial use free of customs du ty. Quantity limits may be set on a commodity-by-commodity basis. There are no special regulations pertaining to border trade. Certain imports and exports are subject to taxes and levies and subsidies in connection with the Equalization Settlement System (see below). Other than these, there are no direct taxes on exports. Imports are subject to stamp duties and turnover taxes at rates similar to those on domestic goods. Exports are free from turnover taxes. POLAND Duties and turnover taxes on imports for export produc- tion are refunded. Economic units are entitled to income tax drawbacks and wage tax exemptions based on both the value of their exports and increases in such values. Drawback rates are set annually by the Minister of Finance. Most trade with CMEA member countries, Albania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is con- ducted under bilateral trade and payments agreements negotiated annually within the framework of five-year bilateral trade and payments agreements. Imports from these countries may be exempted from customs duties. An Equalization Settlement System (ESS) applies to exports and imports of commodities for which domestic prices are set by the Government —i.e., which are subject to "administrative" pricing, and where the established administrative price differs from the external transactions price; the latter price is equal to the price expressed in foreign exchange converted to zlotys at the exchange rate quoted by the National Bank of Poland. To compensate for these price differentials, the ESS, which is operated under the authority of the MFT, credits or debits the relevant economic unit with an equalization amount. All goods for which there are official (government-set) prices are subject to the system, although the MFT has the right to delete products from the list. On a case-by-case basis, the system is also applied to goods subject to contract prices, with the decision whether to do so being negotiated between the MFT and the economic unit concerned. Unless specifically exempted, all foreign currency re- ceipts from exports must be declared, repatriated, and surrendered to the Polish foreign exchange banks. Ex- change received under contractual payment terms must be surrendered immediately; other exchange must be surrendered within one month of its receipt. Nonresidents may take out of Poland, free of customs du ty, souvenirs not exceeding Zl 2,000 in value. However, they may export goods bought in hard currency stores up to the value of foreign currencies declared at the point of first entry and adjusted for reasonable living expenses. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for invisible expenses arising from merchan- dise transactions, including insurance and transportation costs, are permitted freely if related to trade transactions fulfilling licensing requirements. All other invisible trans- actions are carried out under either a general or an individual permit. Foreign exchange for such payments is made available automatically once the transaction has been authorized. In principle, permission for tourist travel to countries other than members of the CMEA, Albania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is granted only if means of support abroad is assured. This requirement can be met in one of the following ways: (1) living expenses while abroad are covered by nonresidents; (2) living expenses while abroad are covered from the resi- dent's own funds in a resident account in foreign con- vertible currencies or, in special cases, from an allowance 401 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution POLAND obtained from the National Bank of Poland; and (3) travel is with an authorized tourist group. Travelers use the funds in their account "A." In special cases, foreign currency travel allowances may be granted by the National Bank of Poland for travel to convertible currency countries. These allowances are subject to a 200 percent foreign exchange tax. For official and business travel, separate allowances are established by the Ministry of Finance to reflect reasonable costs. Nonresident travelers to Poland are expected to fulfill minimum living expenses or conversion requirements up to the equivalent of US$15 per day. When leaving Poland, tourists from convertible currency area countries can reconvert zlotys up to the equivalent brought into Poland, provided the amount is not for more than the amount originally converted into zlotys less the required conver- sion amounts. Without a permit from the foreign exchange authority, residents may bring into or take out of the country domestic currency in an amount not exceeding Zl 10,000 per person, of which the largest permissible bank note is Zl 5,000 and the largest permissible coin is Zl 50. Nonresidents from CMEA countries may bring into or take out of the country zlotys up to the amount certified by their domestic banks. Special exchange regulations apply to invisible trans- actions with CMEA countries: residents visiting CMEA countries are entitled to an allowance of Zl 80,000 per person every two years, and one half of this amount for each child up to the age of 7 years. In addition, funds in accounts "S" may be used. A portion of the travel allowance may be given in the currency of the country visited in amounts determined by that country's regula- tions. For the rest, travelers must acquire traveler's checks in the currency of destination. All conversions are effected with a surcharge. Under certain circumstances, foreign exchange may be made available for study abroad. Students' living expenses and tuition fees abroad must be covered by scholarships or financial support from nonresident relatives. Transfers abroad by nonresident workers in Poland, other than in the context of employment in joint ventures, are deter- mined on the basis of agreements between domestic and foreign institutions or enterprises. Nonresident employees of joint ventures may transfer abroad up to 50 percent of their income. Profits on direct investment by nonresidents, other than those from joint ventures, can be transferred abroad up to a maximum annual amount of 10 percent of invested capital. If the investment yields a convertible currency export to import surplus in any fiscal year, up to 50 percent of the surplus can be transferred abroad, provided the transfer does not exceed 50 percent of net profit after taxes. The Minister of Finance may permit a transfer in excess of 50 percent of the surplus. On liquidation, the investor can transfer abroad the proceeds from the sale of the remaining assets sold in foreign currency. There are no limits on the transfer abroad out of required foreign exchange of profits on direct invest- ment by nonresidents in the form of joint ventures 402 incorporated under the 1986 Law on Companies with Foreign Capital Participation. Capital Parliament annually sets an upper limit on Poland's permissible external indebtedness. Within this limit, for- eign borrowing takes place on the basis of intergovern- mental agreements and in various forms of bank and commercial credits. Under the provisions of the banking law, the National Bank of Poland, Bank Handlowy, Bank PKO, S.A., and the Export Development Bank are empowered to borrow abroad, on short to long term, and to extend foreign credits. The Minister of Finance sets limits on the foreign borrowing of the banks. With approval from the Minister of Finance, socialized enterprises may take financial loans from foreign banks. Subject to approval by the Minister of Foreign Trade, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, socialized enterprises are allowed commercial credits granted by foreign banks or suppliers to finance imports. To borrow abroad, a socialized enterprise also requires the consent of the domestic bank that holds its basic account; one aim of this requirement is to prevent Polish enterprises from circumventing domestic credit policy by use of foreign resources. The Government has established general directives for extending commercial credits relating to foreign trade activities. Socialized enterprises may extend such credits only with approval from the Minister of Foreign Trade, who prescribes the contractual conditions in each case. Negotiable export documents are discountable by the Bank Handlowy. Direct foreign investment in Poland is allowed in the field of small-scale industry under the law of July 6, 1982. A permit is required from the chief administrative office ("voivodship") of the area where the investment is to be located. The permit, which is valid for up to 20 years, is issued after the investor has lodged a "founding deposit" in convertible currency with the Bank PKO, S.A. in an amount equivalent to US$50,000. A foreign investor is obliged to import inputs in kind in the form of machinery and equipment, materials, technology, etc. The value of such goods cannot be lower than the minimum founding deposit, which yields interest according to the normal bank rate and can be withdrawn after certification by the voivodship office that the investment project is complete. Upon liquidation of investment, a foreign investor can transfer abroad the proceeds from the sale of assets sold in foreign currency. A nonresident investor in a small-scale industry can obtain zloty credits from the Bank PKO, S.A. for the financing of both current production destined for the domestic market and for exports and investment outlays associated with such production; such credits cannot exceed 30 percent of working capital for current produc- tion, and they are limited to a maximum of 30 percent of the estimated cost of the project for investments. A nonresident investor is exempt from income tax payments for three years, provided that one third of the tax liability ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution is invested in Poland. The maximum tax rate for nonres- ident investors is 80 percent, but tax allowances are granted if production is directed to final domestic con- sumption or for export, as well as when new investment projects are undertaken. In the latter case, allowances of up to 50 percent of the cost of the project may be granted. In practice, the effective tax rate has averaged 60-65 percent of income. For export production, the investor receives the general exemption from customs duties on imports related to such production. Under the 1986 Law on Companies with Foreign Capital Participation, direct investment by nonresidents is also allowed in all but a few sectors (e.g., defense) in the form of joint ventures with local firms. The maximum tax rate on a joint venture is 50 percent, and rates as low as 10 percent may be applied, depending on the share of exports in total production. Joint ventures also enjoy an initial tax holiday of two years. Foreign investment by residents, either to establish subsidiaries or affiliates, or to acquire an interest in a foreign enterprise, must be approved by the relevant Minister, as well as by the Minister of Finance in his capacity as the foreign exchange authority. All categories of capital transfers, including gifts, by resident natural persons require a foreign exchange per- mit. However, for certain categories, such as inheritances, transfers are authorized on the basis of agreements and re- ciprocity with other countries. An annual limit of Zl 1 mil- lion is applied to all capital transfers. Emigrants to other countries must obtain an individual permit from the National Bank of Poland to take out their convertible currency deposits with domestic banks. Other financial assets may be deposited in a nonresident zloty account. Except in the form of an inheritance, nonresidents may acquire real estate or other immovable property in Poland only with the permission of the foreign exchange authority. POLAND Gold Resident individuals may hold gold in any form. Trading in gold, other than jewelry, is subject to permission from the foreign exchange authorities. Only one enterprise, Jubiler, has general permission to buy and sell gold in any form. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement February 1. The exchange rate of the zioty for the U.S. dollar was changed from Zl 193.25 = US$1 to Zl 240 = US$1, and the exchange rate of the zloty for the trans- ferable ruble was changed from Zl 95 = TR1 to Zl 115 = TR1. April 1. The method of establishing the exchange rate against convertible currencies was modified, resulting in smaller and more frequent adjustments in the rate during April-December 1987. December 31. The exchange rate of the zloty for the U.S. dollar was changed from Zl 240 = US$1 to Zl 315.54, and the exchange rate of the zloty for the transferable ruble was changed from Zl 115 = TR1 to Zl 140 = TR1. Resident and Nonresident Accounts January 1. The foreign exchange retention system (ROD) was modified to permit ownership rights, instead of priority rights, of retained foreign exchange in interest- bearing accounts (accounts "M"). The target average retention rate was specified at 26 percent of exports of goods and services, and the scope for use of funds held in these accounts was expanded. 403 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PORTUGAL (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Portugal is the Portuguese Escudo, the exchange rate of which is adjusted monthly1 in relation to a basket of currencies, weighted according to their importance in Portugal's international merchandise trade. Depreciation objectives for the effective exchange rate of the escudo are announced periodically by the author- ities. On January 1, 1987 the crawling peg rate was set at 0.5 percent per month. On December 31, 1987 the authorized banks' buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were Esc 129.605 and Esc 130.125, respectively, per US$1. Official exchange rates for the U.S. dollar and other currencies2 are determined during the fixing session, in which the Bank of Portugal and the authorized banks participate. There is a tax of 0.6 percent on all sales of foreign exchange. The Macao pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar at a parity rate of P 1.03 = HK$1. Authorized banks may deal in foreign exchange with the Bank of Portugal and among themselves, and they are also allowed to deal in foreign exchange with banks abroad. They have been allowed to enter into arbitrage operations in foreign markets since May 1986. In dealing with their customers, the authorized banks buy and sell foreign exchange in convertible currencies for their own account. Purchases and sales of unquoted currencies can be made only through an authorized bank acting on a commission basis. Banks are required to obtain the prior approval of the Bank of Portugal to accept deposits in foreign currencies from residents or nonresidents and to obtain short-term credits abroad. The banks may use their foreign exchange holdings for all authorized pur- poses, but the Ministry of Finance may set limits on the use of these resources and, in certain circumstances, may require that foreign exchange assets be sold to the Bank of Portugal. The net foreign asset positions of the au- thorized banks and their gross foreign exchange holdings are subject to ceilings. In February 1987 a forward foreign exchange market began to operate. Authorized banks are allowed to conduct forward transactions for periods of up to six months. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Bank of Portugal on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, with the assistance of the commercial banks authorized for this purpose. Foreign trade policy is formulated and implemented by the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism; for statistical purposes, imports are subject to prior registration with 1 Since 1977, except from December 1985 to April 1986. 2 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dol- lars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, the ECU, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Greek drachmas, Italian lire, Irish pounds, Japanese yen, Neth- erlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, South African rand, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 404 the Ministry. The Director-General of Foreign Commerce in this Ministry is responsible for administering trade controls. Import declarations are issued by a department within the Directorate General of Foreign Commerce or by other authorized executive departments. Prescription of Currency Transactions with Turkey are settled on a monthly basis through a clearing account maintained in U.S. dollars. Export transactions with other countries may be settled in the quoted currencies (see footnote 2) or in U.S. dollars. Payments to nonresidents may be made by crediting escudos to a nonresident account, the opening of which is subject to prior approval by the Bank of Portugal. Nonresident Accounts Foreign Accounts in Escudos are divided into (1) Time Foreign Accounts in Escudos; and (2) Demand Foreign Accounts in Escudos, the opening of which is subject to special advance authorization of the Bank of Portugal. These accounts may be debited or credited without prior authorization of the Bank of Portugal for payments for transactions authorized in escudos concerning imports and exports of goods, services, and capital between Portugal and foreign countries and for transfers between such accounts. For all other debit and credit operations, authorization of the Bank of Portugal is required. The granting of credit in the form of overdrafts on the accounts described above requires the authorization of the Bank of Portugal. Foreign Accounts in Escudos in the names of persons resident or domiciled in Turkey, with which Portugal has a special clearing arrangement, are opened, debited, and credited according to instructions issued by the Bank of Portugal. Special accounts in escudos have been established, to which Portuguese bank notes that have been presented by foreign correspondents and are in excess of the amounts that may be credited to Demand Foreign Ac- counts in Escudos must be credited. These accounts may be debited only for payments in escudos to residents, subject to the prior authorization of the Bank of Portugal. Portuguese emigrants may open deposit accounts in escudos and foreign currencies. The emigrants' savings account is a time deposit in escudos. It may be credited with remittances from abroad received through the bank- ing system or in the form of an international postal order, the equivalent in escudos of external means of payments sold to credit institutions by emigrants, and interest due on such deposits. Debits on such accounts are exempt from restrictions. Emigrants' savings accounts are asso- ciated with concessional credit facilities not only for housing purposes but also for the establishment and development of industrial agrolivestock or fishing activ- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ities. The other type of emigrants' deposits in escudos— accounts accessible to residents—are similar to residents' deposits and can be both demand and time deposits. Crediting can be made either from abroad (similar to crediting emigrants' savings deposits) or from domestic funds. Debiting is exempt from restrictions, except deb- iting to abroad, which is subject to regulations that govern current transfers. Emigrants may also freely open time deposit accounts in nine foreign currencies. Such accounts can be credited with remittances from abroad and interest due. Debits are free of restrictions. Interest income from all types of emigrants' deposits is subject to taxation as from April 1985. The initial tax rate of 11.5 percent (inclusive of a surcharge) was lowered to 3.8 percent in August 1985 and to 3.3 percent in 1986. Nonresidents may open time foreign accounts in nine foreign currencies. Such accounts may be credited with transfers from abroad and with the related interest due and may be debited without restrictions. However, a nonresident wishing to use the funds on these accounts in Portugal is subject to the exchange regulations currently in force. There are also provisions for resident accounts in foreign currencies. Imports and Import Payments Prior registration is required for all imports valued at over Esc 100,000. Import declarations serve statistical purposes, and they are granted automatically in four to five days. Imports of certain products are prohibited or are allowed only under specific conditions, mainly for reasons of health, public order, and the prevention of commercial fraud. Any physical or juridical entity may be an importer. Most imports from all sources are effected on the basis of import declarations. For imports free of quantitative restriction, the import declaration enables the importer to obtain the necessary foreign exchange. For agricultural products covered by a common market organization, an import certificate may be required as determined by this organization. For imports subject to quantitative restric- tions, an import license is required. The validity of the import declaration is six months for customs clearance purposes, and the settlement may be effected through the presentation of the declaration of merchandise movement (DMM) up to six months from the date of customs clearance. The settlement period may, in some cases, be extended up to 12 months. When the settlement takes place after the authorized period, the operation is subject to the rules governing capital transactions. Imports of books up to Esc 30,000 and of newspapers and technical, scientific, or cultural periodicals up to Esc 200,000 are also exempt from the import declarations. Payments beyond one year after customs clearance require the approval of the Bank of Portugal. According to the Act of Accession of Portugal to the EC (European Communities), imports of automobiles and some agricultural products are subject to temporary PORTUGAL restrictions, when orginating in the EC and third countries. As regards other industrial products, there is a list of 25 products that are subject to quantitative restrictions only when originating in third countries. A somewhat more extensive restricted list applies to Japan, which includes manufactured raw materials, some textile fibers, and a small number of finished products, including motorcycles. Payments for Invisibles Payments to foreign countries for current invisibles must be made through credit institutions authorized to operate in foreign exchange and are generally free of quantitative restrictions, although prior verification by the Bank of Portugal or other credit institutions properly authorized is required. For most transactions, ceilings are specified for the amounts of foreign exchange that authorized credit institutions may grant freely. For payments to countries with which Portugal does not maintain special clearing arrangements, the authorized credit institutions may grant foreign exchange up to the equivalent of Esc 500,000 per transaction for most types of invisibles, and the licensing centers (established in continental Portugal and the Azores) of those banks may grant up to the equivalent of Esc 7.5 million. For tourism and other private travel (except for business trips, for study or medical treatment purposes, which are not subject to limits when duly evidenced), they may grant to persons 18 years of age or over the equivalent of Esc 150,000 a person a trip, irrespective of age. In addition, tourists may take out of the country Esc 50,000 in local currency for each trip.3 The export of larger amounts of domestic or foreign currency requires the prior authorization of the Bank of Portugal. Applications must be submitted to the Bank of Portugal for exchange for payments of items not referred to above and for payments in excess of the above-mentioned limits. Under the provisions of the Foreign Investment Code, individual remittances of profits and dividends and the repatriation of proceeds of liquidation of direct foreign investment in Portugal are free of restrictions, although prior declaration to the Bank of Portugal is required. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports, which are not subject to quantitative restric- tions under EC regulations, are free of restrictions. The export of some textiles is subject to administrative co- operation with EC countries for a period of two years. The export of a few commodities may be restricted, mainly to ensure adequate supplies to domestic industries and to avoid depletion of local resources. These exports require an export license, as is the case of iron scraps. Exports without concomitant foreign exchange inflow require prior authorization by the Bank of Portugal. 3 The use of credit cards abroad has been liberalized since January 2, 1986. However, legislation in force envisages the possibility of reimposing restrictions by the Bank of Portugal whenever deemed necessary. Also, payments of travel and accommodation expenses abroad for tourism purposes have been liberalized, if paid through a Portuguese travel agency. 405 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PORTUGAL Exporters are required to sell to an authorized bank the total amount of the export proceeds within specified periods. The period for repatriation of export proceeds is, as a rule, fixed at six months from the date of customs clearance. Payment of commission expenses abroad and freight, insurance, or other charges is subject to the regulations that govern payments for invisibles. Proceeds from Invisibles Portuguese residents may receive freely payments in foreign currency for invisibles from residents of countries with which Portugal does not have special clearing ar- rangements. Such receipts may be effected through credit institutions and do not require prior authorization by the Bank of Portugal. Receipts from invisibles must be sur- rendered. Authorized banks are not permitted to receive or to pay domestic or foreign bank notes or coin for settlement of external transactions. There are no limits on the amount of domestic currency notes resident and nonresident travelers may bring into the country. Capital As from January 1,1986, the effective date of accession to the EC, foreign exchange regulations distinguish be- tween capital transactions with residents of EC member countries and residents of non-EC member countries, although in most cases the distinction is not relevant in practice. Most payments will be free of restrictions after a transitional period of four to seven years, depending on the type of transaction. Foreign direct investments in Portugal are permitted in all sectors except those which, under the general law, are closed to private enterprise corporations. Since July 1986, the new foreign investment regulations stipulate that new direct investment projects are only subject to prior declaration to the Foreign Investment Institute, and will be considered approved in the absence of a reply from the Institute within 60 days. However, foreign direct investment in the form of long- term loans is subject to a prior authorization by the Bank of Portugal. In both cases, in 1987 new foreign direct investment by EC residents of less than ECU 1.8 million was automatically approved, and this amount will be increased by ECU 0.3 million a year until 1990 when foreign direct investments will be free of restrictions. The transfer of the proceeds of liquidation of foreign direct investment including capital gains is free of restrictions. Foreign direct investments in EC countries by Portu- guese residents require special authorization until 1993, when they will be free of restrictions. Purchases of real estate in Portugal are free of restric- tions since January 1, 1986, except housing already built and land for agricultural purposes, which are subject to a special authorization by the Bank of Portugal until 1991. The transfer of the proceeds of their liquidation was free of restrictions up to ECU 120,000 in 1987, and it will be increased by ECU 20,000 per annum until 1991. Purchases of real estate in EC countries by Portuguese residents will be free of restrictions from 1993. Purchases 406 by nonresidents of domestic securities quoted in the stock exchange are free of restrictions since January 1, 1986. Purchases by Portuguese residents of securities quoted in the stock exchange and issued by EC residents will remain subject to a special authorization of the Bank of Portugal until 1991. However, subscription of securities issued by the European Investment Bank, the European Economic Community (EEC), the European Atomic En- ergy Community (EURATOM), and the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was free of restrictions up to ECU 18 million in 1987, and it will be increased by ECU 3 million a year until 1991, when such purchases become free of restrictions. Most trade credits and personal capital movements are also free of restrictions since January 1, 1986. The remaining transactions continue to be subject to prior authorization by the Bank of Portugal and, in the case of loans exceeding Esc 800 million and with a maturity of more than one year, approval of the Minister of Finance is also required. In 1987 Portugal continued to revise its reservations to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Devel- opment (OECD) Code of Liberalization of Capital Move- ments. These revisions will liberalize nearly all capital transactions with OECD countries that are free of restric- tions with EC countries. Gold Residents may hold gold in any form in Portugal. The purchase, sale, import, export, or re-export of bullion or coined and unworked gold, when carried out between Portugal and foreign countries, is subject to special advance authorization from the Bank of Portugal. There is a free market for gold in Macao, in which both residents of Macao and nonresidents who are not resident in Portugal may freely trade among themselves in bars, leaves, and coins. Imports and exports of gold, unless made by or on behalf of the Macao monetary authorities, require licenses issued by the Commissioner for Economy. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement February 1. A forward foreign exchange market was established. May 11. The Australian dollar began to be quoted daily. October 1. The official exchange rates began to be determined in a daily fixing session in the spot interbank foreign exchange market. Nonresident Accounts June 30. The regulations governing deposits by emi- grants were amended (Decree Law 263/87 and Ministerial Order 534/87). The main changes concerned the crediting of emigrants' savings accounts and the verification of their eligibility to open emigrants' accounts. ©International Monetary Fund.

PORTUGAL 407 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution QATAR (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Qatar is the Qatar Riyal, which is pegged to the SDR at QR 4.7619 = SDR 1. Qatar has established margins of 7.25 percent around this rate. The Qatar Monetary Agency sets daily market rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, and the pound sterling. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the Qatar riyal in terms of the U.S. dollar were QR 3.6385 and QR 3.6415, respectively, per US$1. The commercial banks' exchange rates for transactions in U.S. dollars are based on the Monetary Agency's buying and selling rates. A spread of 0.87 dirham is applied to exchange transactions with the public. The commercial banks' buying and selling rates for other currencies are based on the Monetary Agency's rates for the U.S. dollar and market rates for the currency con- cerned against the U.S. dollar. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk operating in the official banking sector. In the commercial banking sector, importers may pur- chase foreign exchange in the forward market. Qatar formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, with effect from June 4, 1973. Administration of Control The Qatar Monetary Agency is the exchange control authority, but there is at present no exchange control legislation. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. No other prescription of currency requirements are in force. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Also prohibited are imports of pork and its derivatives. Imports of alcoholic beverages, firearms, ammun i t ion, and certain drugs are subject to licensing for reasons of health or public policy. Otherwise, imports are not re- stricted. There are no restrictions on paymen ts for per- mitted imports. Imports of general goods are subject to a customs duty at the rate of 4.0 percent, which is the m in imum rate applied by member countries of the Co- operation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC). Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Otherwise, all commodities may be exported freely. There are no requirements attached to receipts from exports or re-exports; the proceeds need not be repatriated or surrendered, and they may be disposed of free ly, regard- less of the currency involved. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments may not be made to or received from Israel and South Africa. Otherwise, there are no limitations on payments for and proceeds from invisibles. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or paymen ts by residents or nonresidents, although paymen ts may not be made to or received from Israel and South Africa. Foreign participation in small- and medium-scale agricultural and industrial enterprises with invested capital of less than QR 250,000 is prohibited. Foreign participation in large-scale enterprises requires Qatar nationals to control at least 51 percent of capital unless the enterprise is viewed as facilitating the provision of a public service, in which case the Qatari participation requirement may be waived. In addition to this require- men t, the enterprise must have a domestic value added of at least 40 percent. Foreigners other than nationals of member states of the GCC are prohibited from business ownership in the trade sector. For major industrial proj- ects, it is government policy to assume a m in imum of 70 percent ownership. Gold The monetary authorities and all other residents and nonresidents (including private persons) may freely and w i thout license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. For trading purposes, the selling and buying of gold and precious metals are subject to import license and customs du ty. Transactions involving Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 408 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ROMANIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Romania is the Romanian Leu. The exchange rate used for all trade transactions in convertible currencies is the commercial rate, which is defined in terms of a basket of six currencies reflecting the geo- graphical pattern of Romania's trade and payments. Weekly adjustments are made in the leu/U.S. dollar rate (and, correspondingly, in the rates for all other quoted currencies) in such a way as to maintain the central point on the basket peg. On December 31, 1987 the commercial exchange rate was lei 13.740 = US$1. The National Bank of Romania quotes rates for 16 other currencies defined as "fully convertible"1 and for the Finnish markka, the Greek drachma, the Indian rupee, the Israeli new sheqel, the Portuguese escudo, the Spanish peseta, the Turkish lira, and the Yugoslav dinar, based on the rates for these currencies against the U.S. dollar in the countries concerned. For members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA),2 Albania, and the Democratic Peo- ple's Republic of Korea, the currency used for commercial transactions is the transferable ruble (TR); on Decem- ber 31, 1987 the transferable ruble rate was lei 15.50 per TR 1. For exchange rate purposes, payments for insurance and transportation connected with trade are considered as trade transactions. The commercial exchange rate applies to all trade and most services transactions, and the noncommercial exchange rate applies to non- trade-related services and transfers, with the exception of travel through tourist organizations. Capital transac- tions are settled at the commercial rate. The noncom- mercial rate is pegged to the same basket of currencies as the commercial rate, and is also adjusted on a weekly basis; the rate was lei 8.420 = US$1 on December 31, 1987. For the nontransport component of the expenses for individual travel to nonsocialist countries and Yugoslavia and for certain other expenditures abroad, such as per- sonal subscriptions to periodicals and legal penalties, a 100 percent tax is levied on purchases of foreign exchange. For nontrade transactions with the CMEA countries, Albania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, special exchange rates are established by multilateral or bilateral agreement; for transactions with the U.S.S.R., this rate is lei 8.30 per rub 1. For persons working abroad in technical assistance jobs or as professionals, such as medical doctors, daily allowances are paid in foreign exchange, and any accu- mulated surpluses can be converted into lei at the non- commercial exchange rate. Romanians working in inter- national organizations or joint ventures, as well as those occasionally receiving foreign exchange income, are re- quired to repatriate a part of it as a contribution to the fund for training of staff involved in international coop- eration and for the maintenance of their families at home. Administration of Control Foreign trade is a state monopoly. Import and export transactions are effected by foreign trade enterprises and other authorized units. Import and export transactions are subject to authorizations granted by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and International Economic Cooperation. In the issuing of authorizations, the provisions of existing trade agreements are taken into account. Foreign currency proceeds from exports are sold to the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade; foreign currency required for import payments is purchased from that bank. Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Finance, the National Bank, and the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries with which Romania has bilateral payments agreements are made in currencies and in accordance with the procedures set forth in those agreements.3 If no agreement exists, settlement is usually made in a convertible currency. Certain commercial settlements with Turkey are made in U.S. dollars under a credit agreement. Permitted foreign payments may not be made in lei. Nonresident Accounts Foreign juridical and physical persons may maintain accounts with the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade, the National Bank, or with foreign banks having branch offices in Romania. These accounts are of three kinds. A-Accounts are maintained in convertible currency, or in lei obtained for convertible currencies, from the selling of precious metals, coins, or ingots, other than silver. B-Accounts are maintained in nonconvertible currencies quoted by the National Bank, in clearing currency, or in lei received from the conversion of such currencies. Transactions in any individual B-Account may be effected in only one such currency. C-Accounts are maintained in lei received from other legal sources. 1 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dol- lars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Luxembourg francs, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 2 The participants in the CMEA are Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and Viet Nam. 3 The countries with which bilateral payments agreements were in force as of December 31,1987 were Albania, Bangladesh, the People's Republic of China, Colombia, Ghana, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Settlements with Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, the U.S.S.R., and Viet Nam take place through the multilateral payments system within the International Bank for Economic Cooperation. 409 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ROMANIA A-Accounts may be debited for payments abroad in any currency, for payments within the country, and for transfers to any other A-, B-, or C-Account. B-Accounts may be debited for all payments abroad in the currencies from which the funds were derived and for payments within Romania. C-Accounts may be debited only for domestic transactions. The transactions permitted for the different accounts do not require any further authoriza- tion. Nonresidents may also keep accounts in lei with the Savings and Consignment Bank. The Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade may accept from nonresident customers time deposits in convertible foreign currencies, on which interest is paid at rates prevailing in international markets. Romanian citizens, including Romanians working abroad who transfer their savings to Romania, may open foreign currency accounts with the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade or the National Bank. The deposits may be used for payments in foreign currency, at home or abroad, or for exchange into lei at the noncommercial exchange rate. The entire amount of foreign exchange received from abroad for special purposes for the benefit of Romanian citizens (such as the building or purchasing of a house, the purchase of an automobile, the purchase of other goods or services whose prices are expressed in foreign currency, travel abroad, and other purposes) may be used by the recipients. For certain other foreign exchange receipts from abroad, such as inheritances, donations, assistance, or family maintenance, a proportion may be deposited in a foreign currency account and the rest must be converted into lei at the noncommercial exchange rate. Imports and Exports The administrative framework for planning and exe- cuting foreign trade in Romania is provided in the Foreign Trade Law (Law No. 12 of December 1980). International economic activity is organized and carried out in accord- ance with the principle of working people's self-manage- ment and self-administration of economic, financial, and foreign exchange. The general policy targets for foreign trade are set at the central level. Import and export plans are drawn up by the basic economic units, production enterprises, and industrial centrals on the basis of current and long-term needs. The foreign trade plan specifies only a limited number of goods considered of particular importance for the national economy, especially raw materials. The total planned trade does not separate importing or exporting countries but distinguishes between the clearing area and the convertible currency area, according to the manner of settlement of exchange payments and receipts. Import and export transactions are carried out on the basis of authorizations issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and International Economic Cooperation for each commodity or group of commodities. The authorizations are not restrictive or discriminatory and may be issued, at the request of foreign trade units, for all types of goods, regardless of origin. The Ministry may take measures to curb imports, with a view to equilibrating the balance of 410 payments, for the protection of public health, and for reasons of national defense and the security of the State, etc., in accordance with the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). As a rule, annual import authorizations expressed in value terms are issued to individual importing enterprises as a lump sum or for a single kind of product. The authorization stipulates whether import payments are to be made in convertible currency or under bilateral payments arrange- ments, and, in the latter case, the country is also specified. Export proceeds must be sold to the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade. Imports for investment in complex installations (assem- blies, subassemblies, machinery, equipment, and spare parts) are delivered to the buying units at domestic prices that are equal to the customs value (calculated by mul- tiplying the external price by the commercial rate), plus customs duties. Imports of consumer goods are delivered to the commercial purchasing units at retail prices, less the commercial discount. The difference between prices so derived and prices calculated on the basis of customs value plus customs duties and, in some cases, the turnover tax, is reflected in the financial accounts of the importing foreign trade un i t. Imports are subject to customs duties, although duties are not applied to 121 tariff positions and subpositions. Customs duties are temporarily not being levied on imports of raw materials, assemblies, subassemblies, and spare parts for production, repair, and maintenance, totaling about 500 tariff positions and subpositions. The customs tariff is nondiscriminatory. Decree No. 337/1981, issued on November 26,1981, increased tariffs on personal imports of certain items into Romania above the value limits for the specified goods. The import goods prohibited to individuals include passenger cars with high fuel consumption, minibuses, firearms, and air conditioners. Customs duties on personal imports of a number of consumer durables, such as motorcycles and electrical appliances, are levied at rates of between 100 percent and 300 percent above the applicable customs tariff. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles All transactions in invisibles not connected with foreign trade transactions require general or individual authori- zation given by either the Ministry of Finance or another appropriate ministry. For most categories of payments in respect of invisibles, foreign exchange is made available automatically once the transaction has been authorized. For travel outside the socialist countries, an exchange allocation is provided up to the equivalent of US$70 a trip for each adult. In addition, tourist agencies may organize group or individual trips payable in lei. Receipts from transactions in invisibles must be sold to the Ro- manian Bank for Foreign Trade, and the foreign currency required for payments in respect of such transactions is bought from the same bank. With specified exceptions, travelers with permanent residence in nonsocialist countries must convert at least ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution US$10 a person a day (or the equivalent in other 4 "ac- ceptable" currencies)4 during their stay in Romania. This requirement does not apply to (1) holders of diplomatic service passports and their families; (2) newspaper and radio and television correspondents accredited to Ro- mania and their families; (3) persons studying in Romania and their spouses; (4) permanent foreign personnel of foreign firms or agencies authorized to operate in Romania (including joint ventures) and their families; (5) guests of socialist units and of other juridical persons in Romania, as well as of international organizations having their headquarters in Romania; (6) children under 14; (7) teachers visiting Romania under agreements for cultural, technical, and scientific cooperation and their families; (8) persons who can be shown to have made payments for tourist services; (9) foreign personnel in assembly works or providing technical assistance in Romania and their families; (10) persons of Romanian origin having foreign citizenship or who are stateless; (11) Romanian citizens possessing a valid Romanian passport who are domiciled abroad; (12) persons resident abroad without a valid Romanian passport, but who have not renounced their Romanian citizenship; and (13) parents, spouses, and children of persons in categories (10M12). Foreign diplomats and tourists, as well as Romanian citizens legally holding foreign currencies, may purchase certain domestically produced or imported consumer goods in specialized shops, against payment in convertible curren- cies. Foreign tourists may purchase domestically pro- duced and certain imported consumer goods in specialized shops, against payment in convertible currencies. The import and export of Romanian notes and coin by travelers are prohibited, with the exception of those coming from CMEA member countries, Albania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; these latter may each bring in or take out up to lei 500 a trip in accordance with agreements concluded with these countries. 4 The acceptable currencies, in addition to the U.S. dollar, are Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Greek drachmas, Indian rupees, Israeli new sheqalim, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Luxem- bourg francs, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese es- cudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, Turkish liras, and Yugoslav dinars. ROMANIA Capital All inward and outward transfers of foreign exchange must be authorized by the Ministry of Finance. Outward transfers of funds belonging to resident physical persons are not normally permitted. For certain established cat- egories, such as inheritances, reciprocal agreements have been concluded with a number of countries providing for automatic authorization of transfers of specified amounts to and from Romania. The Foreign Trade Law provides for the establishment of joint ventures in Romania and abroad by Romanian economic organizations. Foreigners are also allowed to invest capital in joint ventures in Romania, up to 49 percent of the total capital of the company concerned. The Foreign Trade Law and implementing decrees guar- antee the repatriation in foreign currency of the capital and the transfer in foreign currency of profits after taxes. By agreement, the accounts of joint ventures may be kept in an agreed currency. Gold The National Bank has sole authority to purchase or sell gold in any manner, at home or abroad. The Bank, in turn, authorizes certain juridical persons to hold gold, to use it, and to engage in gold transactions. The ownership by physical persons, for domestic and personal use, of jewelry and of artistic and cultural objects of gold is not restricted. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement October I. The noncommercial exchange rate was revalued against the basket. The new rate was set at lei 9.00 = US$1, representing an appreciation of 11.6 per- cent against the U.S. dollar, compared with the rate established during the preceding weekly fixing. The com- mercial rate was unchanged at lei 14.60 = US$1, resulting in an increase in the margin between the noncommercial and commercial rates. 411 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution RWANDA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Rwanda is the Rwanda Franc, which is pegged to the SDR at RF 102.71 = SDR 1. This fixed relationship is used to determine the midpoint between buying and selling exchange rates quoted by the National Bank of Rwanda (the central bank) for spot delivery of Rwanda francs against the U.S. dollar and other curren- cies. The National Bank of Belgium informs the National Bank of Rwanda daily of the rates quoted in London for the currencies making up the SDR basket, and this information is used by the National Bank of Rwanda to calculate the rate of the SDR in terms of the U.S. dollar and the rate of the U.S. dollar in terms of Rwanda francs. The National Bank of Belgium also reports the rates quoted in Brussels for the various currencies, including the U.S. dollar, which enables the National Bank of Rwanda to calculate the rates of those currencies in terms of the U.S. dollar. On December 31, 1987 the midpoint between the buying and selling rate for spot delivery of Rwanda francs against the U.S. dollar was RF 73.02 per US$1. The buying and selling rates for all currencies are set at 1 percent above and 1 percent below the midpoint, respectively. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk operating in the official or the com- mercial banking sector. Administration of Control Control over foreign exchange transactions and foreign trade is vested in the central bank; authority to carry out some of these transactions is delegated to authorized banks. Exchange and foreign trade policies are, in prin- ciple, determined by the General Foreign Exchange and Licensing Committee, consisting of the Minister of Fi- nance, the Governor of the National Bank, and five other members; however, this Committee is inoperative at the present time. Prescription of Currency The National Bank maintains agreements with the central banks of the other members of the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries (CEPGL) (Bu- rundi and Zaire), under which settlements are made through reciprocal accounts in domestic currency. Bal- ances on such accounts are periodically transferable. Payments to and from the member countries of the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern African States (PTA) (Burundi, the Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, Somalia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) are made through the PTA's clearing house. Otherwise, payments for imports must be made in the currency approved by the National Bank, which, in principle, is 412 the currency of the country of origin. Payments from any country may be received in Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. Foreign payments, except in border trade, are generally made by bank transfer; the National Bank may, however, authorize other means of payment, such as checks or telegraphic transfers. Exchange transactions with South Africa are prohibited. Imports and Import Payments On October 1,1987 a new Tariff Code was promulgated. Imports from South Africa are prohibited. For reasons of public security, imports of a few types of goods, such as explosives and weapons, require prior approval by the competent authorities, regardless of origin and value. Imports of narcotics are prohibited. All imports valued (c.i.f.) at over RF 100,000 Kigali require licenses, as do those valued (c.i.f.) at less than RF 100,000 Kigali, if payment is required in foreign exchange. Import licenses for 16 items, including cement, bu t ter, cheese, corrugated iron, plastic products, blankets, toilet and powdered soap, candles, insecticides, and woven fabrics of man-made fibers (discontinuous or falling under tariff heading 56.07) have been suspended. The National Bank levies a validation fee of 1 percent of the f.o.b. value on import licenses that involve use of official foreign exchange and on import licenses that are subject to inspection by international agencies; the vali- dation fee for fuel is 0.1 percent. The validation of other import licenses is subject to a processing fee of RF 750 in each case. Before orders are placed, applications for import licenses must be submitted to the National Bank through an authorized bank. Unless otherwise specified, the approval of an import license application constitutes an authorization to obtain the required foreign exchange. The National Bank grants global import licenses for certain essential commodities and for limited amounts to individual firms in order to ensure their continuous op- eration; these are valid for three months (six months in the case of vehicle parts). License applications are ex- amined at the National Bank to avoid overinvoicing. Dealers in imported automobiles are required to provide after-sale service for the vehicles. Used automobiles can be imported only if they are less than three years old, and the importer has to assure the availability of spare parts. Imports whose f.o.b. value on the pro forma invoice is greater than RF 1.5 million in the case of ordinary licenses and RF 0.5 million in the case of global licenses are inspected by international agencies for quality and quan t i ty in the country of origin1 prior to shipment, and 1 Except for imports from Afghan is tan, Albania, Bu rk ina Faso, Bu rund i, Cameroon, Chad, People's Repub l ic of Ch ina, Comoros, Djibouti, Gabon, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution at the same time prices are verified. Import licenses must be presented when the goods are cleared through customs, and a copy of the customs clearance form must be sent to the National Bank. For imports of products originating in member countries of the CEPGL, import licenses are replaced by CEPGL import notices. The Rwanda invest- ment code grants special concessions to enterprises under a contractual arrangement, which may imply exemption from import duties on certain types of equ ipmen t. Payments for Invisibles The prior approval of the National Bank is required for all payments for invisibles. Foreign exchange is sold by the National Bank, through the authorized banks, for transport and other expenses (except insurance) con- nected with imports and exports. Transfers of the salaries or wages earned by foreign nationals employed in Rwanda under contract are made net of taxes, net of the employee's share of social security contributions, and after deduction of local expenses (calculated by one of two formulas, at the employee's option) —namely: (1) 40 percent of gross monthly pay af ter tax and social security contributions, with a m in imum of RF 50,000 a mon th; or (2) RF 70,000 a month for a head of household, plus RF 20,000 a month for each dependent in Rwanda. Transfers of the net earned income of foreign nationals who are self-employed, whe ther engaged in a profession or established as independent traders, are also made net of taxes and after deduction for local expenses. A fee of RF 750 is levied for transfer authorizations other than those relating to income (broadly defined) received in Rwanda, for which a fee of 1 percent of the amount to be transferred is charged, with a m in imum of RF 750. Payments in respect of transport charges on imports cannot be made until imported goods have been cleared through customs (except in cases of payment by means of documentary credit payable on loading). Insur- ance on imports and exports must be taken out locally, with an insurance company established under Rwanda law. Net profits and dividends due to nonresidents may, in principle, be remitted abroad in fu l l, subject to the right of the National Bank to prescribe their transfer in installments. The purchase in domestic currency of tickets for travel abroad requires the prior approval of the National Bank. Authorizations for the purchase of foreign exchange for tickets and foreign exchange relating to travel for leisure, family, or religious reasons are suspended until fur ther notice. Travel for business and official purposes is re- stricted to the essential m in imum, and foreign residents working in Rwanda are allowed only one economy-class airline ticket every two years of actual service in Rwanda; more than one trip is permitted only if the total cost of tickets does not exceed that of one full-fare ticket.

Residents require authorization by the National Bank to take out foreign bank notes. Commercial banks are not permitted to export domestic bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited. All exports, except trade samples, personal and household effects of travelers, and merchandise valued at less than RF 20,000, are subject to prior declaration. Declarations for all exports must be presented to the National Bank through an authorized bank for certification, for which a fee of RF 750 is levied. A declaration is valid for three months, but extensions may be granted by the National Bank, which also reserves the right to determine the conditions for certification. Payments for exports to Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire must be collected not later than 30 days after the goods have left the country; this deadline is not applicable to exports under CEPGL export notices, for which there is a quarterly clearing arrange- ment among the central banks. The maximum permissible period for repatriation of proceeds from exports to all other countries is 120 days. All exchange proceeds from exports must be surrendered to an authorized bank within eight days from their collection. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the authorized banks within eight days from their collection. The collection of claims resulting from services performed for nonresidents must take place within 30 days of the due date. Travelers from abroad may bring in up to RF 5,000 in domestic bank notes and any amount in foreign bank notes. Declaration of means of payment on entering Rwanda is optional. Commercial banks are not permitted to import domestic bank notes. Capital All outward transfers of capital require the prior ap- proval of the National Bank. Such approval is rarely granted unless the transfer relates to a foreign investment in Rwanda that is covered by the Investment Law or to the personal effects of a foreign national returning to his own country. Enterprises considered to have national economic priority are exempted from the corporation tax for 5 to 15 years. Repatriation of dividends to foreign shareholders is allowed. Repatriation guarantees may be given by the National Bank in respect of short-term capital inflows remaining in Rwanda for at least two months. Outward transfer of proceeds from sales of real estate is suspended. Foreign refinancing of imports is subject to guidelines limiting the number of eligible products, establishing a limit of 180 days from the date of shipment on the maturity of the financing, and speci- fying acceptable interest rates and commissions. 413 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement Prescription of Currency The currency of Sao Tome and Principe is the Sao Tome and Principe Dobra, which is pegged to a basket of currencies of nine major trading partners of Sao Tome and Principe. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, were Db 71.735 = US$1 and Db 73.919 = US$ 1, respectively. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are determined on the basis of the exchange rates of the U.S. dollar for the currencies concerned. Foreign exchange transactions are divided into three categories for the purposes of assessing charges on purchases and sales of foreign exchange —namely, import payments, transactions in foreign checks, and collection of export proceeds. On import-related exchange transactions, the arrange- ments are as follows: on the opening of a letter of credit, a charge of 1.125 percent of the import value is payable, with an additional commission to the National Bank of 0.5 percent. A stamp duty of Db 2 per Db 1,000 of import value, plus a flat Db 50, is also payable, as well as a postage levy of Db 50. Any change in the letter of credit carries a further charge of Db 150. On foreign checks for collection, the National Bank applies a commission in favor of the collecting foreign correspondents, varying according to the particular bank. In addition, the National Bank charges a postage levy of Db 20 for each transaction, together with a stamp duty of Db 15. In the period between payment of the import cost by the bank and receipt of funds from the importer, an interest rate of 6.5 percent per annum is charged on the loan. For collection of export proceeds, the National Bank charges a commission of 0.25 percent when opening the letter of credit and a further 0.125 percent when the funds are received. In addition, a postage levy of Db 500 is charged. Administration of Control All foreign exchange transactions are under the control of the National Bank. The exchange controls are applied flexibly, and exceptions to the stated limits are permitted on an ad hoc basis. All foreign exchange proceeds must be surrendered to the National Bank, and all exchange payments must be made through that Bank, with the exception of producers of exported goods who may keep 30 percent of export proceeds in accounts with corre- spondent banks of the National Bank abroad to finance purchases of specified capital goods and inputs used in production. Import and export licenses are granted by the Directorate of External Commerce. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. The National Bank may prescribe the currency in which foreign exchange transactions shall be made. Bilateral payments agreements are maintained with Cape Verde, the People's Republic of China, and the German Demo- cratic Republic. Under the agreement with the German Democratic Republic covering the period 1986-89, Sao Tome and Principe imports building supplies, equipment, and raw materials for the construction and operation of the brew- ery and ceramics factory, as well as certain consumer goods, especially meat and automobile accessories. The quantity of these goods to be imported is specified in annual protocols under the agreement. In return, Sao Tome and Principe is required to export to the German Democratic Republic specified quantities of cocoa and copra annually. Transactions under the payments agreement with Cape Verde have normally covered Sao Tome and Principe's imports from Cape Verde, as well as receipts and pay- ments for various services and transfers. The agreement provides for the central banks of the two countries to grant each other reciprocal noninterest credits of US$200,000; it also states that, should this balance be depleted and a debit balance persist for more than six months, the imbalance will be redressed by appropriate trade transactions between the two parties. Imports and Import Payments The state-owned foreign trading enterprise (ECOMEX) functions only as an intermediary for exports, and all productive entities are permitted to engage in import activity. ECOMEX exercises import monopoly right over beans, edible oil, milk, rice, sugar, and wheat flour. Fuels and lubricants are imported by EMCO (the fuel enterprise), and medicines are imported by ENAMED (the pharmaceu- tical enterprise). Import licenses are granted by the Ministry of Commerce and they must be approved by the National Bank. For all imports, licenses are issued in accordance with Advance Import Registration Bulletins, which are valid for six months, but may be extended if necessary. The license specifies the quantity and the c.i.f. and f.o.b. values of the product to be imported, together with the currency of settlement. Licenses are granted under the annual import plan, taking into account the availability of foreign exchange and the country's supply and economic development requirements. At the time of opening of letters of credit, importers are required to lodge a deposit in domestic currency equivalent to 40 percent of the value of letters of credit; the remainder may be financed with a 120-day loan from the National Bank at an annual interest rate of 22 percent. Prepayment for imports is permitted only through the opening of letters of credit. 421 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are approved within limits established by the National Bank. These limits, which allow for additional amounts in justifiable cases, include those on (1) transfers for medical treatment abroad when local facilities are inadequate; (2) transfers of remittances to students; (3) transfers of savings from earnings under technical cooperation agreements with the Government; and (4) transfers for payment of fares, freight, costs of communication with foreign countries, etc. Purchases of foreign exchange by residents for tourism are strictly limited, although air fares may be paid in domestic currency. Individual expenditures on airline tickets by private citizens for travel abroad may not exceed Db 40,000 in value over a three-year period. Transfers of profits by foreign companies established in Sao Tome and Principe prior to independence have been suspended. There are no limitations on remittances for subscriptions to periodicals, books, etc., or on the payments of interest on external debt. Foreign exchange allowances for medical purposes are permitted up to Db 20,000 for a period of one month. Transfers of pension payments or social security payments are also permitted for nonresident nationals who had been receiving such allowances before 1980. Payments for technical assistance and other services in the national interest are allowed. At the beginning of the school year, a student may receive a special transfer of up to Db 5,000 a year for expenses related to courses taken abroad; additional amounts may be granted if approved by the Ministry of Education and Culture. All payments related to invisibles are subject to a stamp tax of 2 percent of value, or 4 percent if payment is made through a telegraphic transfer. A postage levy of Db 20 is payable on all transactions. Foreign travelers may take out in foreign exchange an amount not greater than the total sum declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require an export license, as set out in Advance Export Registration Bulletins, which specify the quantity and c.i.f. or f.o.b. value of the export. All export proceeds must be received through the National Bank. The state-owned foreign trading enterprise (ECOMEX) is responsible for all export activity. Proceeds from Invisibles Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign exchange. Capital Inward foreign investments are governed by the new Investment Code (implemented in April 1986). Transfers are permitted for repayment of financing under agreements with the Government and for the amortization of private sector investments in activities considered to be in the national interest. Personnel under technical assistance programs are allowed to transfer their savings in accor- dance with the terms of their contracts. Gold Exports and imports of gold require special authori- zation by the National Bank. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement July 22. The exchange rate of the dobra was adjusted from Db 45.25 = SDR 1 to Db 100 = SDR 1, representing a devaluation of 54.75 percent in terms of the SDR. The pegging to the SDR was terminated and the dobra was pegged to a basket of currencies representing nine major trading partners. Administration of Control June 1. All productive entities were permitted to engage in import activities, with the exception of six products (beans, edible oil, milk, sugar, and wheat flour), which are imported by ECOMEX, fuel and lubricants, which are imported by EMCO, and medicines, which are imported by ENAMED. Exports and Export Proceeds June 1. Ail producers of goods were permitted to retain 30 percent of export proceeds, keep the balance in accounts with correspondent banks of the National Bank abroad, and use it to finance imports of specified capital goods and inputs used in production. 422 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SAUDI ARABIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Saudi Arabia is the Saudi Arabian Riyal, which is pegged to the SDR at SRls 4.28255 = SDR 1. In principle, margins not exceeding 7.25 percent are allowed around the fixed relationship; these margins were suspended on July 22, 1981. The middle rate of the Saudi Arabian riyal for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, quoted by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency is determined on the basis of the International Monetary Fund's daily calculation of the U.S. dollar-SDR rate. On December 31, 1987 the Monetary Agency's middle rate for the U.S. dollar was SRls 3.745 per US$1; it sold U.S. dollars to banks at SRls 3.750 per US$1 and bought from banks and the principal producer of petroleum at SRls 3.740 per US$1; these rates served as the basis for exchange quotations in the market, the banks being permitted to charge up to 0.25 percent above and below the Monetary Agency's buying and selling rates. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Saudi Arabia formally accepted the obligations of Ar- ticle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement as from March 22, 1961. Prescription of Currency The use of the currencies of Israel and South Africa is prohibited.1 No other prescription of currency require- ments are in force. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are not required, and exchange for payments abroad may be obtained freely. The importation of a few commodities is prohibited for reasons of religion, health, or security; importation of certain other items in specified forms is also prohibited. Most imports are subject to customs duties at rates ranging between 7 percent and 20 percent; imports from member states of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) are exempted, provided that at least 40 percent of the value added in each case is effected in GCC countries and that at least 51 percent of the capital of the producing firm is owned by citizens of GCC member countries.2 Certain imports from Lebanon are subject to proof-of- origin requirements. 1 In addition, all imports from and all exports to these countries are prohibited; payments may not be made to them or be received from them for all types of transactions whether of a current or capital nature. 2 Effective January 2, 1988, the m in imum customs du ty was raised to 12 percent and the number of duty-free imports was reduced. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are not required, and no control is exercised over export proceeds. The re-export of certain imported items benefiting from government subsidy is prohibited. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for and proceeds from invisibles are not restricted. Travelers may freely import and export Saudi Arabian bank notes and coin. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. The Monetary Agency has issued guidelines to its foreign correspondent banks requiring them to seek approval prior to the flotation of riyal-denominated loans. Local banks are prohibited from inviting foreign banks to par- ticipate in riyal-denominated syndicated transactions in- side or outside Saudi Arabia without prior approval of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency. Prior approval by the Monetary Agency is also required for participation by local banks in either riyal-syndicated transactions arranged abroad or foreign-currency-syndicated transac- tions arranged for nonresidents. The Foreign Capital Investment Law provides for specified benefits to be extended to approved foreign investments in Saudi Ara- bia. Approved foreign capital enjoys the same privileges as domestic capital under the 1962 Law for the Protection and Promotion of National Industry. Foreign capital invested in industrial or agricultural projects with at least 25 percent Saudi Arabian participation is exempt from income and corporate tax for ten years after production has begun. Borrowing from foreign banks is subject to a withholding tax on the repatriation of interest earnings. Gold The monetary authorities and all other residents, in- cluding private persons, may freely and without license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. They may also, without a license and without payment of any customs duty or tax, import and export gold in any form, with the exception of 14-karat gold, the import of which is prohibited. Changes During 1987 Prescription of Currency October 5. A bilateral trade agreement aimed at pro- moting trade, investment, and transfer of technology and containing most-favored-nation provisions was concluded with Canada. 423 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SENEGAL (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Senegal is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.10 per mill for transfers from countries outside the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) and 2.50 per mill for transfers to such countries.2 An exchange commission of 0.125-1.0 per mill, depending on the amount, is charged by the banks on purchases or sales of foreign exchange other than those directly related to external transactions. In addition, they levy a com- mission on transfers to all countries outside the WAMU, 72 percent of which must be surrendered to the Treasury through the Central Bank. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Forward covers against exchange risk can be obtained by residents only in respect of imports of a specified category of goods. All other forward covers against exchange risk are subject to authorization by the Direc- torate of Money and Credit (Ministry of Economy and Finance). Forward covers against exchange risk can be provided only in the currency of settlement stipulated in the commercial contract. Maturities must correspond to the due date of foreign exchange settlement as stipulated in the commercial contract and must not exceed one month. For some specified products, the maturity of forward covers may be extended up to three months once. With the exception of measures relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, Senegal's exchange controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Bur- kina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of Money and Credit in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Part of the approval authority in respect of exchange control has been delegated to the BCEAO and 1 The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de FA f r ique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Ben in, Burk ina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2 Transfers between member countries of the Un ion are subject to a m in imum flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO. 424 to authorized banks. The BCEAO is authorized to collect, either directly or through the banks, other financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries pub- lic, any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks, the Postal Administration, or the BCEAO. Export authorizations and prior import authorizations are issued for listed products by the Ministry of Commerce. Prescription of Currency Since Senegal is an Operations Account coun try, set- tlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Current transactions with The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Ni- geria, and Sierra Leone are normally settled through the West African Clearing House. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. All settlements with South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting to nonresident accounts of CFA bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other ins t i tu te of issue that maintains an Operations Account is not permitted, except for BCEAO bank notes mailed to the BCEAO agency in Dakar by an authorized bank's foreign corre- spondent; such bank notes may be credited to a Foreign Account in Francs opened by the latter with an authorized bank in Senegal. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, without prior authorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes mailed by authorized intermediaries directly to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments Imports originating in or proceeding from South Africa are prohibited, and the import of certain goods is prohib- ited from all countries except member states of the West African Economic Commun i ty (WAEC). The import from any source of a number of other commodities is subject to prior authorization by the M in is try of Economy and Finance. Imports from countries in the French Franc Area are generally free of prior authorization and quan- titative restriction. Imports of virtually all goods from European Economic Commun i ty (EEC) countries (the six original member states) and imports of some goods from all countries of the former Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), the United States, and Canada are free of quantitative restriction; such liberalized imports require only an import certificate made out by ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution the importer himself. Imports of certain goods from countries outside the EEC, the French Franc Area, or the WAEC are subject to prior authorization. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 100,000 (delivered at the Senegalese border or c.i.f.). The exchange authorizations entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than eight days before shipment if a documentary credit is opened, or the due date for settlement if the commodities have already been imported (if no docu- mentary credit has been opened, on presentation of the bill of lading). Furthermore, paymen ts for imports may not be made prior to customs clearance. Payments for Invisibles All payments to South Africa are prohibited. Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to exchange approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Authorized interme- diary banks are empowered to effect any payment abroad up to CFAF 20,000 on behalf of residents without requiring documents. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted, on the basis of a request for exchange autho- rization submitted to the Ministry of Finance. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Oper- ations Account countries may obtain an exchange allo- cation equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a year for each person (CFAF 100,000 for children under 10); any foreign ex- change remaining after return to Senegal must be surren- dered. Applications for additional amounts of foreign exchange may also be approved on the basis of applica- tions for foreign exchange authorizations submitted to the Ministry of Finance. For business travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 300,000 a person a trip, but not more than the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 in BCEAO bank notes or its equivalent in currency notes issued by the Bank of France or a bank of issue linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account may be taken. The transfer of the fu ll net salary of a foreigner working in Senegal is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months following the pay period. Resident and nonresident travelers to foreign countries may take out, in addition to any foreign exchange allo- cation, up to CFAF 20,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other Operations Account countries. Resident travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes, bu t, if proceeding to a country that is not a member of the WAMU, they must declare to customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 200,000. SENEGAL Nonresident travelers may freely take out any means of paymen t, such as traveler's checks, issued abroad in their name. However, the export of foreign bank notes in amounts in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 50,000 is authorized only up to the amount declared by them on entry (minus sales of foreign exchange in Senegal and plus any repurchases up to CFAF 50,000). Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. With a few exceptions (e.g., gold, diamonds, tuna fish), exports to countries in the French Franc Area are free of prior authorization. Most exports to other countries require authorization mainly in order to assure adequate supplies for domestic needs and to prevent certain re-exports. Certain nontraditional exports to nonmember countries of the WAEC are eligible for an export subsidy equivalent to 25 percent based on industrial value added at inter- national prices. Proceeds from exports to foreign coun- tries, including members of the WAMU and countries of the French Franc Area, must normally be collected within 120 days of the arrival of the goods at their destination and repatriated not later than one month after the due date. All export transactions exceeding CFAF 500,000 must be domiciled with an authorized intermediary bank. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered, if received in foreign currency, within one month of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area; residents bringing in foreign bank notes must declare them to customs upon entry and sell them to an authorized bank within eight days. Capital All settlements between Senegal and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between Senegal and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require approval by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Controls are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward inves tmen t, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Senegal. Such operations require prior au- thorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the 425 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SENEGAL Senegalese Government, and (2) shares that are identical with, or may be substituted for, securities whose issue, offering, or sale in Senegal has previously been autho- rized. With the exception of controls over foreign secu- rities, these measures do not apply to France, Monaco, member countries of the WAMU, and the Operations Account countries. Special controls are maintained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate and building operations abroad; these special controls also apply to France, Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All investments abroad by residents of Senegal require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance;3 75 percent of such investments must be financed with borrowing abroad. Foreign direct investments in Senegal4 must be declared to the Minister of Economy and Finance before such investments are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration, during which he may request postponement of the project. Both the making and the liquidating of direct and other investments, whether these are Sene- galese investments abroad or foreign inves tmen ts in Senegal, must be reported to the Minister of Economy and Finance and the BCEAO within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments constitute inves tmen ts implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere par- ticipation is not considered as direct inves tmen t, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Lending abroad requires prior authorization by the Min- ister of Economy and Finance. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) borrowings constituting a direct in- 3 Inc lud ing inves tmen ts made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Senegal and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Senegal. 4 Inc lud ing those made by companies in Senegal which are d irec t ly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Senegal of foreign companies. ves tmen t, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; and (2) borrowings contracted by au- thorized banks. The repayment of borrowings not con- stituting a direct inves tment requires the authorization of the Minister of Economy and Finance if the borrowing itself was subject to such approval, but is exempt if it was exempt from authorization. The Investment Code provides various facilities and benefits for approved foreign inves tmen ts in Senegal. There are special facilities for export industries estab- lished in the Dakar export-processing zone. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Senegal. Imports and exports of gold (gold jewelry and gold materials) from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Exempt from this requirement are: (1) imports and exports by the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quan t i ty of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold articles up to a combined weight of 200 grams. Brokers in precious metals require an authorization from the Minister of Economy and Finance to conduct their busi- ness. Imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Purchases abroad of nonmonetary gold by brokers are subject to a 25 percent ad valorem tax. Commercial imports of gold jewelry require prior import authorization by the Minister of Commerce, and imports of ornaments require the prior advice of the Directorate of Handicrafts (Ministry of Industrial Development and Handicrafts) and the Directorate of Foreign Trade (Ministry of Commerce). Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments February 3.

Not for Redistribution SEYCHELLES (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Seychelles is the Seychelles Rupee, which is pegged to the SDR at SR 7.2345 = SDR 1. Exchange rates for various currencies (including the pound sterling, the intervention currency) are quoted on the basis of their New York closing rates for the U.S. dollar on the previous day, using the U.S. dollar rate for the Seychelles rupee as derived from the fixed parity to the SDR. These rates are circulated daily to the com- mercial banks by the Central Bank. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates of the Central Bank of the Seychelles for the pound sterling were SR 9.5422 and SR 9.6377, respectively, per £ stg. 1. The Central Bank charges a commission of 0.125 percent for buying and 0.875 percent for selling of pounds sterling and U.S. dollars. The commercial banks are authorized to deal in pounds sterling and other currencies at rates based on the exchange rates circulated daily by the Central Bank for the respective currencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk in the official or the commercial banking sectors. Seychelles formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from January 3, 1978. Administration of Control and Prescription of Currency There is no exchange control, and there are no pre- scription of currency requirements. The Seychelles Mar- keting Board exercises controls on foreign trade and domestic marketing; its Import Division and Import Con- trol Unit perform regulatory and commercial roles pre- viously handled by the Seychelles National Commodity Corporation (SEYCOM). Imports and Import Payments No restrictions are placed on payments for imports. Importers are required to obtain import licenses from the Seychelles Licensing Authority and to apply for import permits from the Import Control section of the Seychelles Marketing Board. Certain basic food items (including sugar, flour, oil margarine, rice, and animal feeds) can be imported only by the Seychelles Marketing Board. Most imports are subject to the trade and service tax, at rates ranging from 10 percent to 350 percent (with the bulk of imported commodities falling in the range of 10 percent to 50 percent). Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments for invisibles, and no limits are imposed on the provision of travel exchange. Travelers may take or send out of Seychelles any amount of foreign currency and up to SR 100 of domestic currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports normally do not require licenses. Exports of copra, cinnamon, and fish (the principal exports) are controlled by the Seychelles Marketing Board. Residents may export goods without exchange control formality to any country except South Africa. Export proceeds need not be repatriated or surrendered. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles may be disposed of freely. However, trading in foreign currencies by persons other than authorized dealers is prohibited. Overseas visitors may bring in any amount of currency for travel expenditure. Capital Outward transfers of overseas-owned capital are al- lowed without limit. Non-nationals are permitted to re- patriate their surplus earnings without limit. New investment outside Seychelles by permanent res- idents and by companies and other organizations operating in Seychelles is not subject to any limitation. Foreign investment (whether portfolio, direct investment, in- creased investment in existing entities in the form of loans, or equity capital) is not restricted. Commercial banks in Seychelles are required to restrict credit to non-nationals primarily for working capital purposes only and generally to an amount not in excess of overseas funds invested in Seychelles in enterprises in certain priority sectors —i.e., agriculture and fishing, man- ufacturing, construction, and tourism. In addition, penalty loan rates are imposed on credit secured by foreign assets. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad, but dealings in gold bullion are restricted to authorized dealers. Two commemorative gold coins in denominations of SR 1,500 and SR 1,000 have been issued and are legal tender. Another gold coin in the denomination of SR 20 issued in December 1983 in commemoration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Central Bank is also legal tender, and a fourth issue (in the denomination of SR 25) was made in April 1984 to mark the World Fisheries Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Two other gold coins, also legal tender, were issued in 1986: (1) in February, to commemorate the United Nations Decade for Women Coin Program (in the denomination of SR 500); and (2) in June, to mark the tenth anniversary of Seychelles' independence (in the denomination of SR 1,000). In 1987, another gold coin in the denomination of 427 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution SIERRA LEONE (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Sierra Leone is the Sierra Leonean Leone. The exchange rate of the leone, which had been floating with effect from June 27, 1986 and had been allowed to depreciate from Le 14 per US$1 in Ju ly 1986 to Le 53 per US$1 in April 1987, appreciated to Le 23 per US$1 in August 1987. Between August and end- December 1987, the exchange rate of the leone against the U.S. dollar remained unchanged. Administration of Control Exchange control policy is formulated by the Ministry of Finance, in consultation with the Bank of Sierra Leone, but the day-to-day administration of exchange control is carried out by the Bank of Sierra Leone with the assistance of the commercial banks. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Trade and Indus try under an open general license system. Authority for approving transactions of items under open general licenses and most invisible payments is delegated to authorized dealers. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Transactions with all countries are subject to exchange control. Certain settlements with the People's Republic of China must be channeled through clearing accounts established under the bilateral paymen ts agreement. Pay- ments for imports from other countries may be made in leones to the credit of an External Account in the currency of the exporting country, in pounds sterling, or in U.S. dollars. Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burk ina Faso, Cote dTvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, and Nigeria are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Receipts from exports other than dia- monds to countries other than the People's Republic of China may be obtained in leones from an External Account in the currency of the importing country or in any specified currency.1 Receipts from all exports must be obtained in the currency of the importing country or in any other specified currency and surrendered through the banking system of Sierra Leone. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in leones held with authorized banks in Sierra Leone on behalf of diplomatic missions, United Nations agencies, and their accredited staff are designated Exter- nal Accounts. In addition, there are Blocked Accounts, to which funds due to nonresidents that may not be remitted abroad are credited. 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, CFA francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. Imports and Import Payments All goods, with the exception of a list of prescribed items —ammunition, drugs, cartridges, and gambling ma- chines, and imports from Namibia and South Africa — may be imported under open general licenses that are issued freely. Authority for approving transactions is delegated to the commercial banks. All applications for purchase of foreign exchange for the importation of goods must be supported by a valid import license, pro forma invoice, and current certificate of income and should be submitted to a commercial bank in Sierra Leone. Letters of credit must be opened within three working days of the purchase of foreign exchange; if not, foreign exchange is resold to the commercial bank and a penalty of 0.25 percent a day is imposed. Imports are subject to an invoice entry fee and an import licensing fee of 5 percent which is calculated on the c.i.f. value of imports; they are payable at the time of importation. Payments for Invisibles Authority to provide foreign exchange for legitimate expenses is delegated to the commercial banks within the following guidelines. Foreign exchange up to US$100 per individual per month may be freely sold by the commercial banks. Requests for purchases of foreign exchange in excess of this amount must be supported by adequate documentation. Applications for basic travel allowance in excess of US$1,000 a year per adult person must be referred to the Bank of Sierra Leone for approval. A travel tax of 10 percent is levied on the price of tickets and is payable when the ticket is purchased. Exports and Export Proceeds With the exception of some products, the exportation of which is restricted to certain state corporations, export licenses are granted by the Ministry of Trade and Industry for the export of all products to all countries except Namibia and South Africa. All exports must be effected either under letters of credit opened with a commercial bank in Sierra Leone or on a prepayment basis with a commercial bank in Sierra Leone. All exporters are required to complete CD.2 forms and secure an export license from the Government relating to specific goods or services to be exported. In principle, all exporters are required to fully surrender foreign exchange earnings to the commercial banks. However, certain rentention arrangements exist with some of the main exporters. The exportation of gold and diamonds, which had in the past been carried out by licensed firms under the supervision of the Government Gold and Diamond Office (GGDO), has been nationalized. The Bank of Sierra Leone is at present the sole exporter of gold, and the GGDO is the sole exporter of diamonds, respectively. 429 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SIERRA LEONE Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in specified currencies (see footnote 1) must be offered for sale to an authorized bank within three days. The importation of domestic bank notes is limited to Le 20 for each traveler. Residents receiving foreign currencies or entering Sierra Leone with foreign exchange must exchange these currencies into domestic currency at a commercial bank within three days. Nonresidents bringing foreign exchange into Sierra Leone must exchange or deposit it with a bank within three days. Capital Capital payments to nonresidents of Sierra Leone are subject to exchange control. Residents of Sierra Leone require permission from the Bank of Sierra Leone to purchase foreign currency securities or real estate situated abroad. Investments by nonresidents, including profits, may be repatriated at any time, provided that exchange control permission was obtained initially for the investment. The Sierra Leone Exchange Control Act of 1954 im- poses control on the issue and transfer of securities. The placing of an issue in Sierra Leone requires permission if either the person acquiring the securities or the person for whom he is nominee is resident outside Sierra Leone. Permission must also be obtained before a security reg- istered in Sierra Leone may be transferred to a nonresi- dent. Capital in respect of securities registered in Sierra Leone may not be transferred abroad without permission. Where permission has been given for securities registered in Sierra Leone to be sold to persons resident abroad, the company is usually required to obtain bank certifi- cation of the funds brought into Sierra Leone. The Development Ordinance of 1960 and the Development of Industries Act, 1983, provide for income tax and customs duty concessions to foreign and domestic companies undertaking industrial or agricultural activities that are needed for the development of the country. Noncitizens are prohibited from owning or controlling certain types of business. Residents of Sierra Leone must sell their foreign ex- change holdings to an authorized dealer. Exemption is granted for authorized dealers, diplomats, and holders of sterling assets held prior to June 24, 1972 for which exemption has been claimed and granted by the Bank of Sierra Leone. Exempted securities may be sold outside the former Sterling Area, and any income therefrom may be retained in the former Sterling Area or reinvested in other Sterling Area securities. Any certificate of securities purchased with the proceeds of the sale of securities exempted under this permission is exempt from deposit requirements. Any assets held outside the former Sterling Area by any foreign national temporarily resident in Sierra Leone are also exempt from surrender and deposit re- quirements, provided that exemption has been claimed and granted by an authorized dealer or by the Bank of Sierra Leone. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Sierra Leone for numismatic purposes. Also, residents and nonresidents may freely purchase, hold, sell, or export certain Sierra Leonean commemorative gold coins. With these exceptions, only the Bank of Sierra Leone is authorized to export gold in any form other than jewelry; residents must declare and make available to the Gov- ernment gold held in the form of bars or coin. Imports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require individual import licenses, which are not normally granted. Travelers do not require a license to take out personal jewelry if the value of the total gold and platinum content does not exceed Le 200. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments July I. A wide range of import taxes was revised upward. December 1. All unnumbered licenses, which had allowed importation of goods without the necessity to declare the source of foreign exchange, were suspended. Exports and Export Proceeds July 1. The export taxes for coffee and cocoa were increased to 17.5 percent of the f.o.b. value. November 3. All private export licenses for gold and diamonds were suspended. The GGDO and the Bank of Sierra Leone became the sole exporters of gold and diamonds, respectively. Proceeds from Invisibles November 3. The holding of foreign exchange beyond three days was made illegal. 430 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SINGAPORE (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Singapore is the Singapore Dollar. Singapore follows a policy under which the Singapore dollar is permitted to float, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore monitors its value against a trade-weighted basket of currencies. The exchange rate of the Singapore dollar in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention cur- rency, and all other currencies is freely determined in the foreign exchange market. The Interbank buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1987 were S$1.9980 and S$1.9990, respectively, per US$1. Rates for other currencies are established on the basis of the daily rate for the U.S. dollar and their cross rates in international markets. Banks are free to deal spot and forward in all currencies, w i th no limits on maturities or underlying transactions. Foreign currency fu tu res are traded at the Singapore International Monetary Exchange. Banks can hedge their exchange rate risk through a forward foreign exchange transaction. There is also an active short-term currency swap market among the banks in the domestic money market. Singapore and Brunei currency notes and coins are freely interchangeable, at par and without charge, in Singapore and Brunei. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Singapore formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from November 9, 1968. Administration of Control There are no exchange control formalities, but the Monetary Authority of Singapore retains responsibility for exchange control matters. The Trade Development Board under the Ministry of Trade and Indus try admin- isters and registers imports and exports. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Nonresident Accounts There is no distinction between accounts of residents and nonresidents of Singapore. Debits and credits to all accounts may be made freely. Imports and Import Payments Virtually all imports are permitted freely. A few imports are controlled for health, safety, or security reasons. All imports originating in South Africa or any territory admin- istered by it are prohibited. Import licenses are required for the following items, irrespective of origin: (1) rice, air- conditioning machines not exceeding 9,000 KCAL/H (excluding air-conditioning machines for motor vehicles); and (2) all goods originating in or consigned from Albania, the German Democratic Republic, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, and Viet Nam. License applications for goods under the second category are subject to a surcharge of 0.5 percent of the c.i.f. value of imports, payable to the Government. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles may be made freely. There are no restrictions on the amount of foreign exchange made available for travel abroad. Remittances to nonres- idents of dividends, interest, and profits may be made freely. Resident and nonresident travelers may take out any amount in foreign or Singapore bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of certain textiles and garments of Singapore origin to countries of the European Communities, Austria, Canada, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United States are subject to quantitative restriction in the importing countries. Export licenses are required for granite, sand, timber, and rubber. Export proceeds need not be surren- dered and may be disposed of freely. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles need not be surren- dered and may be disposed of freely. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount in foreign bank notes and coin, including Singapore gold coin. Capital There are no restrictions on capital transfers. Loans in Singapore dollars in excess of S$5 million to nonresidents or to residents for use outside Singapore require the approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Gov- ernment approval is required for foreigners investing in residential and other properties (including vacant land) other than those zoned or approved for industrial or commercial use. A foreigner may, however, freely pur- chase a residential unit within a building of six or more stories and in an approved condominium development without such approval. With regard to other residential properties, foreigners who make an economic contribution to Singapore will be given favorable consideration for purchase of these properties for their own occupation and, in the case of foreign companies, for the accom- modation of their senior personnel. Banks in Singapore may freely accept deposits in foreign currencies. Financial institutions that have been approved to operate Asian Currency Units (ACUs) in Singapore are able to offer better rates for foreign currency deposits placed with their ACUs because of the absence of mini- mum cash reserve and liquidity requirements. An ACU is a separate accounting entity of a financial institution, which enjoys a concessional rate of tax of 10 percent on its income; it is prohibited from transacting in Singapore dollars. 431 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SINGAPORE Income earned by nonresidents on funds placed by them with an approved fund manager in Singapore for investments in offshore and in the domestic stock market is exempted from tax under the Tax Exemption Scheme for Offshore Fund Management. Gold There is a free gold market in Singapore. Both resident and nonresident individuals and companies are permitted to import, hold, negotiate, and export gold freely; imports and exports require neither exchange control approval nor import or export licenses, and gold can be dealt with freely by any person in Singapore. Gold can be traded on the spot or fu tures markets. In the spot market, most of the trading is done on a London basis where delivery of 995 fine gold is made in London; trading also takes place in Kilobar gold with settlement of 999.9 fine gold being made in Singapore, with appropriate adjustments made for the cost of transportation and insurance. A gold futures contract is also available on the Singapore Inter- national Monetary Exchange. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 432 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOLOMON ISLANDS (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Solomon Islands is the Solomon Islands Dollar, which is issued by the Central Bank of Solomon Islands. The exchange rate for the Solomon Islands dollar is determined on the basis of a relationship between the Solomon Islands dollar and a trade-weighted basket of the currencies of Solomon Islands' four major trading partners. The Central Bank may make discretionary adjustments in the exchange value of the Solomon Islands dollar, up to a total of 2 percent during any four-week period. The Central Bank provides the commercial banks daily with the limits on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in their transactions with the Central Bank and the public. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates quoted by the banks in their dealings with the public were US$0.5080 and US$0.5050, respectively, p e rS I$ l. The commercial banks in Solomon Islands are free to determine their exchange rates for all other foreign cur- rencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Forward cover facility is mainly for bona fide trade or trade-related transactions. Com- mercial banks may enter into forward contracts with permanent residents of Solomon Islands in any currency. However, the Central Bank will only provide cover in U.S. dollars and for periods of one to three months. The Central Bank also provides the commercial banks daily with the limits as a percentage of the forward buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar for one, two, and three months for their dealings with the Central Bank. Com- mercial banks are allowed to apply a margin of up to ten basis points above or below the Central Bank's forward rates in respect of their U.S. dollar forward contracts with the public. Solomon Islands formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund's Articles of Agreement on July 24, 1979. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank by means of the Exchange Control (Foreign Exchange) Regulations, which came into force on March 1, 1977. The Central Bank delegates extensive powers to com- mercial banks, which have been appointed authorized dealers in foreign exchange. The authorized dealers may approve certain types of application for exchange control approval up to specified limits. All persons residing in Solomon Islands are regarded as permanent residents for exchange control purposes, unless they have been granted temporary resident status by an authorized dealer or by the Central Bank. Appli- cations for temporary resident status are normally ap- proved if the person is a citizen of a foreign country and intends to reside in Solomon Islands for a period of less than four years or has resided in Solomon Islands for over four years but who can produce evidence of firm intention to resume permanent residence overseas in the near future. Ownership of real property (other than dwellings for own occupation) or a business indicates permanent residential status, regardless of the duration of residence in Solomon Islands. However, temporary resident status does not release a person from the obli- gation to comply with all provisions of the exchange control regulations. Prescription of Currency Contractual commitments to persons resident outside Solomon Islands that are expressed in a foreign currency may only be met by payments in that foreign currency. Export proceeds may be received in any foreign currency or in Solomon Islands dollars from an account of an overseas bank with a bank in Solomon Islands. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may open nonresident accounts in Sol- omon Islands dollars with authorized dealers, but approval from the Central Bank is required for the crediting of these accounts from Solomon Islands sources. Balances on such accounts may be transferred abroad with the approval of the Central Bank or authorized dealers. Imports and Import Payments No restrictions are placed on payments for imports, provided that it can be shown that they are properly due overseas. Authorized dealers are permitted to approve most transactions without reference to the Central Bank. Payments for Invisibles Approval is readily given for payments for services and remittances of dividends, profits, and other earnings accruing to overseas residents from companies in Solomon Islands, provided that it can be shown that they are properly due overseas. Permanent residents are permitted to purchase foreign exchange for payment of all types of invisibles if supporting documents are provided. Transfers by postal order to persons residing permanently outside Solomon Islands are permitted, provided that the total amount transferred does not exceed SI$100 a week. Approval is normally given for the purchase of foreign currency for travel purposes. Applications for travel funds must be lodged with an authorized dealer, and applicants are required to present their passports and passage or flight tickets. Requests for unusually large amounts of foreign exchange are referred to the Central Bank. Trav- elers may not take out Solomon Islands currency notes and coin in excess of SI$250 without the approval of the Central Bank; approval is not normally given. 433 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOLOMON ISLANDS Exports and Export Proceeds Residents may export goods without exchange control formality, provided that they comply with the terms of the General Authority issued by the Central Bank. The essential conditions of this General Authority are that payments for exported goods are received within three months after the date of export, that the export price is not less than the price which an exporter might reasonably be expected to receive, and that the proceeds are sold promptly to an authorized dealer. Where exporters are not in a position to comply with the conditions of the General Authority, they must apply to the Central Bank for a Specific Authority. Authority is not needed for goods under SI$250 in value in any one consignment or for certain exempted categories of goods, including most kinds of personal effects of passengers. Proceeds from Invisibles Approval is required for the disposal of foreign currency proceeds other than by means of a sale to an authorized dealer. Overseas residents visiting Solomon Islands may bring in any amount of currency for travel expenditure. Capital All outward transfers of capital require exchange con- trol approval. All applications for transfers must be referred to the Central Bank. Approval is readily given for the withdrawal of non-resident-owned investment capital, repayment of overseas borrowings, and the re- mittance of temporary residents' and emigrants' funds. New investment abroad by permanent residents or by companies and other organizations operating in Solomon Islands is subject to certain limitations. Direct investment overseas is permitted when it is likely to be of benefit to Solomon Islands. In the case of portfolio investments, the approval of the Central Bank is needed prior to the acquisition or disposal of foreign securities by a permanent resident. Approval is normally not given for the acqui- sition of overseas portfolio investments. Restrictions are not normally imposed on the disposal of foreign securities acquired prior to March 1, 1977. Approval by the Central Bank is required for a resident to borrow funds from or to issue equity capital to a nonresident. The Solomon Islands branch of a company or firm incorporated overseas requires approval by the Central Bank before it may borrow funds from a nonres- ident, including the branch's overseas head office. Where initial or increased foreign investment is concerned, the Foreign Investment Board must also give its approval. Gold Solomon Islanders alone are granted a license to pan for alluvial gold. Commercial banks and all other residents are required to obtain a permit issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources to mine, buy, or export gold. The Central Bank is authorized to buy, sell, and hold gold but has not yet undertaken any such transactions. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 434 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOMALIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Somalia is the Somali Shilling, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar at So. Sh. 100 = US$1. The Central Bank of Somalia carries out transactions in certain other currencies,1 taking into account rates in European exchange markets. The official exchange market in So- malia comprises the Central Bank and the sole commercial bank operating as the authorized dealer of the Central Bank in respect of transactions in foreign currencies. On the receipts side, the official rate applies to all transactions including the surrendered portion of export proceeds, official loans, grants and investment income, and foreign exchange receipts of embassies and international orga- nizations other than organizations belonging to the United Nations; on the payments side, it applies to all transactions including payment for imports, travel, expenses of Somali embassies abroad, official imports of crude petroleum and petroleum products, and the operational costs of the Central Bank. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange risk operating in the official sector. The com- mercial bank also does not conduct forward exchange transactions on behalf of the public, although this is not prohibited. Up to September 16, 1987, Agricultural Sector Adjust- ment Program credits of the International Development Association (IDA), as well as grants from donors, were disbursed through auctions that were held twice a month. Administration of Control The Ministry of Commerce is the principal government agency concerned with the implementation and operation of trade controls. Exchange controls are administered by the Central Bank. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Settlements with the U.S.S.R. are made through bilat- eral clearing accounts denominated in pounds sterling.2 Settlements with all other countries must be made in Somali shillings or in specified currencies (including the U.S. dollar; see footnote 1); however, residents are not permitted to make settlements with Israel or South Africa. Nonresident and Foreign Currency Accounts Nonresident accounts in foreign currency may be opened with the Central Bank by foreign embassies and inter- national institutions. External accounts in U.S. dollars may be opened by both residents and nonresidents. Such accounts may be credited with foreign exchange trans- 1 Deutsche mark, Djibouti francs, French francs, Italian lire, Kuwaiti dinars, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Swiss francs, and U .A .E. dirhams. 2 This bilateral payments agreement has been inoperative since 1977. ferred from abroad and may be debited for any external payment, but not for transfers to other external accounts. Exporters of goods and services may deposit up to 40 percent of their foreign exchange proceeds from exports in export-promotion accounts. Funds in such accounts may be used for merchandise import payments, for invisible payments under existing regulations, or they may be deposited in an import account. Import accounts in foreign exchange may be opened only by residents and may also be credited from transfers of foreign exchange from abroad, and from external accounts held by the same economic entity. Foreign exchange in these accounts may be used for merchandise import payments, or invis- ible payments in accordance with existing regulations. Imports and Import Payments Imports of goods originating in or shipped from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Imports of alcohol, tobacco, and tobacco products, crude oil and petroleum products, medical and pharmaceutical products, explo- sives, precious metals and jewelry, and minerals are subject to prior approval. All other items, with the exception of items prohibited for reasons of public safety and social policy, may be imported freely. The state- trading organization, the National Agency for Trade (ENC), is responsible for the import and distribution of certain commodities received under aid programs. The Somali Oil Refinery is responsible for the import of crude petroleum, and the National Petroleum Agency is re- sponsible for imports of other fuels and fuel products. Importation and distribution of petroleum products by capable entrepreneurs in the private sector are permitted. All payments for private imports must be effected through letters of credit. Private importers may open letters of credit for imports at the commercial bank on the basis of foreign exchange made available for that purpose through a foreign currency account with the commercial bank; in such a case, the foreign exchange involved is kept in a suspense account until the time of settlement of the letter of credit. The holders of export- promotion accounts, import accounts, and external ac- counts are permitted to use the balance on these accounts for import payments. In principle, the commercial bank must sell foreign exchange to private importers at the official exchange rate. A non-interest-bearing advance deposit of 100 percent is required to open letters of credit for private sector imports; the deposit is retained until the letters of credit are settled. Payments for Invisibles Payments to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Payments for current invisibles through export- promotion, import, and external accounts, as well as through the commercial bank selling foreign exchange on its own account, are subject to licensing to prevent 435 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOMALIA unauthorized capital transfers. Transfers of salaries, wages, gratuities, and allowances paid in Somalia to foreign personnel by enterprises registered under the Foreign Investment Law are allowed up to 50 percent. The Central Bank provides foreign exchange only for official travel expenses. Foreign exchange for private travel expenses is allowed to be purchased only from holders of external accounts with the approval of the Central Bank, subject to the following limits: (1) education allowances, US$1,000 per year; (2) business and tourist travel, US$200 per person per trip; and (3) medical treatment, US$3,000 per year. The Central Bank may approve applications for larger amounts in exceptional cases. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports and re-exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Bananas are exported only by SOMALFRUIT (previously, the National Banana Board). The export of various types of ivory, hides and skins, and minerals is subject to prior approval. All export proceeds must be repatriated. Exporters may retain up to 40 percent of their foreign exchange receipts in export-promotion accounts and must surrender the remainder to the Central Bank or to the authorized dealer. There are exceptions to this rule allowing larger retention of foreign exchange to those enterprises whose activities depend crucially on imported inputs. For exports other than those made under letter of credit arrangements, an advance payment deposit of 100 percent of the value of exports is required. A tax of 25 percent is levied on exports of livestock, on the basis of minimum export prices used for purposes of duty collection. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles are subject to repatriation and declaration. Exporters of services may retain up to 40 percent of their foreign exchange receipts in export- promotion accounts; they must surrender the remainder to the Central Bank or to the authorized dealer within five business days after their receipt. Nonresidents may freely bring in with them any amount in foreign exchange and up to So. Sh. 200 in Somali bank notes and coins; they must make a currency declaration when entering the country. Nonresident Somalis and foreign national travelers without diplomatic status are required to convert at least US$100 or its equivalent to Somali shillings at the airport branch of the Central Bank upon arrival. Unspent foreign exchange may be taken out of the country without restriction. Resident travelers may bring in up to So. Sh. 200 in Somali bank notes and coin and are obliged, upon arrival, to declare any foreign exchange they bring in and to deposit it in external accounts or sell it to the commercial bank at the official exchange rate upon arrival. Capital Capital transactions are subject to licensing unless they are authorized by the Foreign Investment Law of Feb- ruary 1960, as amended in January 1977 and May 1987. 436 The amended Foreign Investment Law stipulates priori- ties for foreign investments in the agricultural, livestock raising, fishing, mining, and tourism, and industrial and service sectors. Under this law, investments may be made, apart from transfer of convertible currency, in the form of machinery, equipment, current production inputs, and intangibles (patent rights, trademarks, and studies and documentation prepared in connection with the in- tended investment). There are no outright and sectoral restrictions to foreign investment or phase-out provisions, nor does the law preclude the possibility of participating, or acquiring stock, in an existing Somali enterprise. Proposed foreign investment is reviewed for approval in each case within a 60-day period by the Foreign Investment Board, which has final authority over all matters concerning foreign investment. The Foreign In- vestment Board is assisted by the Foreign Investment Promotion Office, which provides advice and guidance to the foreign investor on Somalia's legal, regulatory, and institutional framework, and assists at the incorporation and setting-up stages. The original foreign investment and any reinvested profit may be registered in convertible currency. There are no restrictions on reinvestment of profit. Profit is freely transferable, and profit not trans- ferred, or portions of it, may be transferred in any subsequent years. Foreign investment (original invest- ment plus any profit reinvested) can be freely repatriated five years from the date of the registration of the original investment. Repatriation can be effected in convertible currency or, at the investor's option, in the form of physical assets. The Foreign Investment Board may reduce the above-mentioned five-year period. Capital gains resulting from sale of shares of liquidation of assets are freely transferable, after payment of normal taxes. The Law restricts the possibility of expropriation only to cases where public interest cannot be satisfied by mea- sures other than expropriation. In such cases, prompt and freely transferable compensation is payable in an amount that reflects the inves tmen t's fair market value as a going concern. Investment disputes are settled in a manner to be agreed upon with the investor, or in the absence of such agreement, under the agreements in force between the investor's home country and Somalia, or in their absence, under the 1985 World Bank Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes. In case none is applicable, the Law provides for resolution by a three-member arbitration board, whose chairman is to be appointed by agreement or, in its absence, by the President of Somalia's Supreme Court. Gold Residents may hold and acquire in Somalia, for num- ismatic purposes only, gold coins that are not legal tender in any country. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require the permission ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution of the Central Bank; such permission is not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Gold imported by jewelers must be melted down w i th in one month to a fineness of not more than 22 karats. Imports of gold are exempt from customs du ty when originating in European Communities (EC) countries; imports from elsewhere are subject to a 10 percent du ty. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement June 16. The three foreign exchange markets —namely, the official market, the free market, and the auction market —were unified through the extension of the auction system. In order to help finance the main auction, a 100 percent surrender requirement on exports was instituted, and the auction was to be funded by up to 50 percent of export proceeds with cash and commodity assistance being provided by some donors. The rest of the export proceeds, transacted at the current auction rate, were to be utilized for debt service payments and other official purposes. Holders of external accounts at the commercial SOMALIA bank could continue to credit them with inward remit- tances and to use the proceeds for their own purposes. However, transfers between external accounts were no longer permitted; the holders were required to go through the auction to convert these accounts into shillings. Similarly, holders of export-promoting and import ac- counts could continue to use the balances in these accounts for imports, but they could not add to their accounts. October 12. New measures pertaining to the exchange system were implemented, which included termination of the foreign exchange auction, and the fixing of the exchange rate at So. Sh. 100 = US$1. October 19. The October 12 measures were further modified. Exporters were now authorized to retain up to 40 percent of export proceeds in export promotion ac- counts and to use these funds for any purpose except transfer to others. Capital May 15. An amended Foreign Investment Law was promulgated. 437 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOUTH AFRICA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of South Africa is the South African Rand. The authorities of South Africa do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions but intervene in the exchange market to affect the rates quoted by the commercial banks for the ''commercial" rand. The prin- cipal intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. On Decem- ber 31, 1987 the commercial banks' spot rates for the U.S. dollar in transactions with the public were US$0.5210 buying and US$0.5185 selling, per R 1. Subject to certain limitations, authorized dealers are permitted to conduct forward exchange operations, in- cluding cover for transactions by nonresidents, on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Authorized dealers are permitted to provide forward exchange cover in any foreign currency to residents for any firm and ascertained foreign exchange commitments/accruals due to/by non- residents arising from authorized trade and nontrade transactions. Forward exchange contracts may cover the entire period of the outstanding commitments/accruals. Forward exchange cover may also be provided to non- residents subject to certain limitations. The Reserve Bank of South Africa provides forward cover in U.S. dollars only; such cover is given to authorized dealers for maturities not exceeding 12 months at a time in the form of rand-U.S. dollar swap transactions with a margin based on an interest rate differential between the U.S. dollar and the rand. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Abolished on February 7, 1983 and reintroduced on September 2, 1985 (without the participation of Swazi- land), the freely floating "financial" rand derives from the local sale and redemption proceeds of South African securities and other investments in South Africa owned by nonresidents, capital remittances by emigrants and immigrants, and approved outward capital transfers by residents. The exchange rate for the financial rand is usually at a discount from the commercial rand rate; at the end of 1987, the discount was about 38 percent, and the closing midpoint exchange rate of the financial rand in terms of the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1987 was R 3 . 14 = US$1. South Africa formally accepted the obligations of Ar- ticle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund's Articles of Agreement, as from September 15, 1973. Exchange Control Territory There are virtually no exchange or trade restrictions between the Republic of South Africa (defined for ex- change control purposes as including South West Africa), Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Lesotho, Swaziland, Transkei, and Venda, and these form, with the Republic of South Africa, a single exchange control territory —the Common Monetary Area. 438 Administration of Control Exchange licensing is the responsibility of the Treasury, which has delegated this authority to the South African Reserve Bank; in turn, the Reserve Bank has delegated much of its licensing powers to the authorized dealers. Import and export permits are generally issued by the Director of Import and Export Control acting on behalf of the Minister of Economic Affairs and Technology. Exchange for licensed imports is made available by the authorized dealers upon proof of shipment or, where advance payment is proposed, upon presentation of other documentary evidence, which must include the prior approval of the Reserve Bank .1 Arrears are maintained with respect to certain external payments. Prescription of Currency All countries outside the Common Monetary Area constitute the Nonresident Area. The rand is legal tender in Lesotho but not in Swaziland.2 Settlements by/to residents of the Common Monetary Area with the Non- resident Area may be made in rand to and from a Nonresident Account and in any foreign currency.3 Nonresident Accounts The rand accounts of nonresidents4 are divided into Nonresident Accounts, Financial Rand Accounts, and Emigrant Blocked Accounts. Nonresident Accounts may be. credited with all au- thorized payments by South African residents, with the proceeds of sales to authorized dealers in South Africa of foreign currency, and with payments from other Non- resident Accounts in South Africa. They may be debited for payments to Common Monetary Area residents for any purpose (other than loans); for payments to nonres- idents for any purpose, that is, by transfer to a local Nonresident Account, or for remittance to any country outside the Common Monetary Area; for the cost of purchases of any foreign currency; and for payments to the account holder while temporarily resident in South Africa for short periods. Financial Rand Accounts are the accounts of nonres- idents of the Common Monetary Area to which exchange control restrictions have been applied. Such accounts are 1 Authorized dealers can pe rm i t, w i thout Reserve Bank approval, advance payment of up to 331/3 percent of the ex-factory cost of capital goods, if such is the requirement of suppliers. 2 Lilangeni bank notes issued by Swaziland are freely convertible into rand, but they are not legal tender in South Africa. Maloti bank notes issued by Lesotho are freely convertible in to rand at par, but they are not legal tender in South Africa. 3 Foreign currency, foreign exchange, exchange, and specified currency mean any currency other than currency wh ich is legal tender in South Africa but exclude the currencies of Lesotho and Swaziland. 4 A nonresident is a person (i.e., a na tural person or legal en t i ty) whose normal place of residence, domicile, or registration is outside the Common Monetary Area. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution maintained with authorized banks. They must be credited with the local sale and redemption proceeds of South African securities and other investments in South Africa owned by nonresidents. Immigrants (excluding former South African residents) arriving after September 1, 1985 may, without Reserve Bank approval, during the first three years of their residence, introduce their capital through the medium of the financial rand. The release locally of these funds is subject to certain limitations. Dealers on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange are per- mitted to quote prices for financial rand, and its members are permitted to buy and sell financial rand as agents, acting on behalf of nonresidents. Authorized banks are freely permitted to transfer financial rand balances from one Financial Rand Account on their books to another, on their own books or on the books of another authorized bank. Funds in these accounts may be used freely for reinvestment in locally quoted securities (which may be exported and sold abroad) or for acquiring quoted central government, municipal, or public utility stocks. On ap- plication and approval, financial rand may be used by nonresidents for the purchase of other assets. The local sale proceeds of South African securities held by immi- grants prior to their arrival in South Africa, or acquired abroad within three years of their arrival, are also credited to Financial Rand Accounts. Emigrant Blocked Accounts are the accounts of emi- grants from the Common Monetary Area to which ex- change control restrictions have been applied. They must be credited with any cash held at the time of departure and with the proceeds of any other South African asset held at the time of departure and subsequently sold. Such funds may not be transferred from South Africa or to another Emigrant Blocked Account in South Africa, but may be retained on deposit with an authorized dealer, used within certain limits for the holder's living expenses while visiting South Africa, or for other specified pay- ments to residents, or be invested in any securities that are quoted locally; such securities may not, however, be exported and sold abroad. Special Restricted Accounts are the accounts of non- residents to which restrictions specifically relating to the debt standstill arrangements have been applied. Imports and Import Payments Goods subject to import control are listed in Schedule I of the Import Control Regulations published on May 30, 1985. All importers requiring import permits for trade or manufacturing purposes must be registered with the Director of Import and Export Control. The permits are valid for imports from any country. Imports free of permit include all goods imported from Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, and Swaziland, which were grown, produced, or manufactured in these countries, with the exception of sugar from Swaziland and a limited range of agricultural products from Malawi. An importer is automatically granted exchange to pay for current imports upon presenting to his bank the SOUTH AFRICA necessary consignment documents (proof of importation) and an import permit where required. Payments prior to the date of shipment or dispatch are not normally allowed, except with prior approval or special authorization by the Reserve Bank (see footnote 1). With certain exceptions, imports are subject to a general sales tax of 12 percent, as are locally produced goods. Payments for Invisibles Authority is delegated to the authorized dealers to approve certain current payments for invisibles without limitation and for others up to established limits. Appli- cations for amounts in excess of these limits are consid- ered on their merits by the Reserve Bank. For current income payments, such as declared dividends, profits, royalties, etc., that accrue in South Africa, approval is given by the authorized dealers without reference to the Reserve Bank, provided that the relevant royalty agree- ment was approved by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Reserve Bank, and provided the remit- tance of profits and dividends is based on earnings generated after January 1, 1984 and does not involve the use of local credit facilities. Favorable consideration is, however, given by the Reserve Bank to such transfers where the use of local credit facilities is not regarded as excessive. Income earned from securities held by non- residents is freely transferable to the owner's country of residence. Limited amounts of exchange to pay for membership fees, family maintenance, etc., are authorized. The basic allowance for tourist travel in a year is R 10,000 for an adult and R 5,000 for a child under 12 years. Separately, there is an annual basic exchange allocation of R 4,000 for an adult (R 2,000 for a child under 12) for travel to neighboring countries, i.e., Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Zaire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. In addition to the tourist allowances, author- ized dealers may grant allowances for business trips overseas at a rate not exceeding R 750 a day, with a maximum of R 15,000 in a calendar year. The separate applicable allowance for business trips to the neighboring territories mentioned above is R 8,000 a year, at a rate not exceeding R 600 a day. Residents leaving South Africa for destinations outside the Common Monetary Area may take the full applicable allowance in foreign bank notes. The amount of South African Reserve Bank notes, however, may not exceed R 200, but this is not regarded as being part of the basic travel allowance. Foreign visitors leaving South Africa may take with them up to R 200 in Reserve Bank notes and any amount of foreign notes that they brought into the country or obtained from the disposal of instruments of exchange that they brought to and exchanged in South Africa. These limitations on the export of Reserve Bank notes do not apply in the case of contract workers returning to neighboring countries, who are permitted to take with them reasonable amounts in bank notes. There are no limitations on the export of domestic currency to Lesotho and Swaziland. 439 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOUTH AFRICA Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of specified commodities considered as being in relatively short supply or controlled for strategic reasons require export permits for their sales to buyers outside the Common Customs Area (combined areas of Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland). Unless otherwise permitted, all export proceeds must be remitted to South Africa and surrendered within six months from the date of shipment or seven days from the date of accrual. To ensure a more effective application of exchange control procedures regarding the repatriation of export proceeds, exporters are required to cover forward their export proceeds within seven days of shipment. Authorized dealers may permit exporters to grant credit up to 12 months, provided the credit is necessary in the particular trade or needed to protect an existing export market or to capture a new export market. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered within seven days from the date of accrual, unless exemption is obtained. Upon entry from countries outside the Common Monetary Area, residents and nonresidents may bring in R 200 in South African Reserve Bank notes. There are no limitations on the import of domestic currency from Lesotho and Swaziland. Capital5 All inward loan transfers require specific approval;6 inward transfers for investment in equity capital are freely permitted. Foreign exchange accruing to residents from capital transfers and transactions must be surrendered. Outward transfers of capital by residents to destinations outside the Common Monetary Area require the approval of the Reserve Bank. Local borrowing by non-resident- owned or non-resident-controlled firms is subject to lim- itation. Transfers by residents for the purchase of South African (or other) shares on foreign stock exchanges are generally not permitted (except in amounts not exceeding R 2,000 through financial rand for each shareholder, to allow South African residents to exercise rights arising from existing holdings of shares in foreign companies quoted only on foreign stock exchanges), although South African stockbrokers may engage in arbitrage transactions in securities, subject to certain conditions designed to prevent any net outflow of exchange. Applications by South African residents to retain in, or transfer to, countries outside the Common Monetary 5 Securities are defined as inc lud ing not only quoted stocks, shares, debentures, and rights, but also unquo ted shares in public companies, shares in private companies, government, municipal, and public u t i l i ty stocks, non-resident-owned mortgage bonds, or participations in mortgage bonds. The terms "scrip" and "share certificates" include any temporary or substitute documents of title, such as letters of allotment, option certificates, balance receipts, and any other receipts for scrip. 6 Approval is generally given for borrowing abroad with a ma tu r i ty of at least six months by domestic entrepreneurs, except for speculation or consumer credit. Authorized dealers generally are permitted to raise funds abroad in their own names for the financing of South African foreign trade and other approved purposes. 440 Area funds for bona fide long-term investment in specific development projects or for the expansion of existing projects that are owned or controlled by South Africans are considered by the Reserve Bank on their merits. Inves tmen ts designed to foster exports and to maintain or expand markets abroad are normally viewed favorably. Immigrants are required to fu rn ish the exchange control authorities with a complete return of their foreign assets and liabilities at the time of their arrival. Any foreign assets transferred to South Africa may, through the same channel, be retransferred abroad within the first three years after arrival. The proceeds of the sale of quoted or unquoted South African securities, real estate, and other equity invest- ments by nonresidents of South Africa to residents must be credited to Financial Rand Accounts and are accord- ingly transferable through this medium. Emigrant families are entitled to the normal travel allowance at the rate for commercial rand and are per- mitted to remit up to R 100,000 (R 50,000 for single persons) through the medium of financial rand. Any balance exceeding the permissible transferable amount must be credited to an Emigrant Blocked Account. The total net income earned from an emigrant's blocked assets may be transferred. An emigrant family or an individual can export one motor vehicle, with a max imum value of R 20,000, provided that it was purchased at least one year prior to emigration, and can export other household and personal effects up to a value of R 20,000 for each fam i ly, provided that such goods, other than clothing, have been in the em igran t's possession for a period of not less than one year. Favorable consideration is given for the transfer by non-resident-owned branches and subsidiaries of open or approved loan account balances,7 current profits earned after January 1, 1984, and d iv idends declared on profits from trading generated after January 1, 1984, provided that the remittance does not involve the excessive use of local credit facilities. The physical export from South Africa of non-resident-owned securities is permitted, except by emigrants. Gold Residents of South Africa may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in South Africa for num isma t ic and inves tment purposes. With this exception, residents of South Africa other than the monetary authorities, authorized dealers, registered gold producers, and authorized industrial and professional users are not allowed to purchase, hold, or sell gold in any form other than jewe lry, at home or abroad. All exports of gold require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. The approval authority has been delegated to authorized dealers in respect of exports of jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler up to a value of R 20,000 (subject to a written declaration to the effect that the jewelry will be brought back to South Africa on the traveler's re turn); and in respect of 7 Subject, however, to the s tands t i ll arrangemen ts, where applicable. ©International Monetary Fund.

Furthermore, after reference and approval by the Reserve Bank, residents are allowed to export currency coins, including certain gold coins, for sale to numismatists. The gold mining industry must sell its output to the Reserve Bank within one month of production. The arrangement whereby the Reserve Bank paid the gold mines in U.S. dollars for 50 percent of their total sales, with the balance settled in rand, was cancelled with effect from December 9, 1985. From this date the mines are paid in rand only. As a special concession, the industry may retain approximately one third of its pro- duction for the minting of gold coins and kilo bars. The Mint from time to time strikes gold coins and the Krugerrand without a face value, which are legal tender but do not circulate in South Africa; these are made available in limited numbers to resident collectors, and the bulk is sold abroad. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments June 3. The import surcharge of 10 percent on raw materials and intermediate products used in manufactur- ing was eliminated. SOUTH AFRICA Payments for Invisibles September 17. The travel allowances were increased as follows: (1) annual tourist travel allowances, from R 6,000 to R 10,000 for an adult, and from R 2,000 to R 5,000 for a child under 12 years; (2) business travel allowance, from R 500 to R 750 a day, with the max imum amount from R 10,000 to R 15,000 a year. Annual basic exchange allocations for business and tourist travel to neighboring countries were also increased. Indian Ocean Islands were no longer regarded as neighboring territories for travel allowance purposes. Capital January 1. The Reserve Bank ceased to provide long- term forward cover to public sector and government institutions. March 24. New Interim Arrangements with respect to certain foreign debt repayments were concluded with bank creditors. The arrangements are to be effective until June 20, 1990. April 9. Rights accruing on foreign securities owned by residents were allowed to be followed only through financial rand; (previously, they were allowd to be fol- lowed through commercial rand). Limits remained unchanged. 441 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SPAIN (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Spain is the Spanish Peseta. The authorities of Spain do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions; exchange rates are determined largely on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the foreign exchange markets. However, the authorities intervene when necessary in order to smooth out fluctua- tions in exchange rates and to maintain orderly conditions in the exchange market. Following its routine monitoring of foreign exchange market developments in the course of the morning, the Bank of Spain meets each working day around noon in an official session with the commercial banks, at which the latter trade freely in foreign exchange among themselves. By adding a certain margin to the weighted average exchange rate in these transactions, the Bank of Spain calculates the officially quoted exchange rates for specified currencies,1 and they are published daily. These rates are the maximum offer and bid rates to be applied by commercial banks to customers in transactions smaller than Ptas 20 million (exchange rates for larger transactions are determined freely). Authorized banks are allowed to operate in foreign markets for spot and forward transactions. All fu ture transactions involving an identifiable exchange risk are eligible for forward cover. There are no limits on periods to be covered, except that commercial banks are not authorized to provide cover for periods shorter than one month in cases where the nonresident is selling forward an already existing convertible peseta balance. There are no limits on forward or spot foreign currency positions of individual banks, except those stemming indirectly from prudential rules on maximum net foreign exchange exposure. Under existing regulations, consolidated net foreign exchange exposure must exceed a percentage of the consolidated own resources of each banking group which is determined by the Bank of Spain. Spain formally accepted the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from July 15, 1986. Exchange Control Territory The Peninsular Territories of the Spanish State, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands, Ceuta, and Melilla constitute a single exchange control territory. Administration of Control The Ministry of Economy and Finance, through the General Directorate for Foreign Transactions, handles exchange control regulations, including those pertaining 1 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dol- lars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Greek drachmas, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Ne ther lands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, and European Currency Un i ts (ECUs). 442 to trade and invisible transactions, foreign investment, investment abroad by Spanish residents, and domestic borrowing by foreigners. The Bank of Spain handles the foreign exchange market (both spot and forward), regu- lates and supervises commercial banks' activities, and is responsible for all nontrade foreign borrowing (both short- term and long-term) by domestic residents. Prescription of Currency Settlements on account of merchandise transactions and invisibles may be made in convertible pesetas or in any of the currencies specified in footnote 1, but they are usually made in the currency of the country of origin or destination. Nonresident Accounts As from December 1985, accounts affected by the regulations on nonresident accounts are either convertible accounts or ordinary accounts. Convertible Peseta Accounts. Convertible Peseta Ac- counts may be credited with the proceeds of foreign currency bank notes only in certain cases in the Spanish foreign currency market, with authorized payments made by residents to nonresidents as a result of any balance of payments transactions, with accrued interest on such accounts, and with transfers from other such accounts. Convertible Peseta Accounts may be debited for pur- chases of equivalent amounts of foreign currency and bank notes in the Spanish foreign currency market, for authorized paymen ts in pesetas to residents as a result of any balance of paymen ts transactions, for cash draw- ings by nonresidents, and for transfers to other peseta accounts. Under temporary restrictions introduced in April 1987 aimed at countering short-term capital inflows, banks are forbidden to pay interest on balances on Convertible Peseta Accounts exceeding Ptas 10 million. Convertible peseta balances are subject to a reserve requirement. Balances in Convertible Peseta Accounts are eligible for forward cover in the forward exchange market in Spain. Ordinary Peseta Accounts (Royal Decree 1723/85 and Resolution of December 20, 1985) can be credited freely. Balances in such accounts, which are not convertible, may be utilized to cover tourist expenses in Spain, as well as inves tmen ts that can qualify as foreign invest- ments; transfer rights for such inves tmen ts, financed by ordinary pesetas, require the fu lf i l lment of certain con- ditions (e.g., a three-year maintenance period for the transfer of principal, proof of the legal origin of the funds deposited, and verification in the General Directorate). Imports and Import Payments As a general rule, imports may be made freely into Spain. However, imports of certain goods are subject to authorization by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution irrespective of the country of origin (e.g., color television sets, tractors, explosives, carpets, sewing machines, plas- tics, seed oil, gold, etc.) or when imported from specific geographical areas (with distinctions being made between European Communites (EC) countries, Portugal, Euro- pean Free Trade Association (EFTA)-Mediterranean and ACP2 countries, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) member countries, and state trading countries). Foreign exchange in the appropriate currency to pay for authorized imports is granted freely. All import trans- actions must be domiciled with an authorized bank, and the import payment must be made through the bank of domiciliation; exempt from domiciliation are transactions valued at less than Ptas 0.5 million, provided that payment is to be made within one year. Payments for Invisibles Commercial banks are authorized to sell foreign ex- change freely for listed current invisibles, provided that the request is supported by appropriate documents to verify the authenticity of the transaction. Holders of Spanish securities may freely transfer abroad accrued interest, dividends, and proceeds from the disposal of subscription rights. Purchasers of securities bought with internal pesetas must hold them for three years to qualify to transfer abroad the proceeds from the liquidation of such securities. Profits and dividends on direct invest- ments and rents on non-resident-owned real estate are freely transferable abroad. A general license permits the reinsurance abroad of risks insured in Spain with Spanish firms or with foreign insurance companies operating in Spain. Unless special authorization is otherwise granted, insurance contracts abroad are restricted to cover for exports and imports of goods and related operations. Payments up to Ptas 50,000 for any purpose may be made without supporting documents. There are no limits on foreign exchange purchases for tourism (the maximum limit on foreign exchange allowances was removed in March 1987). However, the export of currency (i.e., bank notes or coins) in excess of Ptas 350,000 in foreign currency and in excess of Ptas 100,000 in domestic currency must be reported and requires prior approval of the Bank of Spain. Proceeds from the liquidation of foreign investments are freely transferable abroad, provided that they were not financed from Ordinary Peseta Accounts. Exports and Export Proceeds As a general rule, exports may be made freely. How- ever, exports of a limited number of goods require prior authorization by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade, irrespective of the area of destination (e.g., textiles, steel, some copper by-products, etc.) or when exported to certain geographical areas (with distinctions being made between EC countries, Portugal, and third countries). 2 African, Caribbean, and Pacific State signatories to the Lom6 Con- vention with the EC. SPAIN Proceeds from Invisibles All foreign exchange proceeds from invisibles must be sold in the exchange market through authorized banks within 15 days of receipt. Capital For most direct foreign investments effected through participation in Spanish companies, prior verification is required only if participation exceeds 50 percent. Irre- spective of the size of companies, such investments need to be communicated to the Directorate-General of Exter- nal Transactions for verification, and can be considered approved in the absence of a response after 30 days. Special authorization is required for foreign investment in strategic sectors (such as defense-related industries, strategic minerals, and telecommunications services), television, radio, air transport, and gambling. Foreign investments for the acquisition of branches or real estate are not subject to restriction, if financed with convertible currencies; with the same exceptions as for participation in Spanish companies, such investments only need to be communicated to the Directorate-General of External Transactions for verification, and can be considered as approved in the absence of a response after 30 days. Purchases of real estate with a balance in Ordinary Nonresident Accounts are considered foreign investments, and are subject to the same regulations as those applicable to foreign investments made through these accounts. Nonresidents may freely purchase shares and bonds; however, issuance by banks of certificates of deposits denominated in convertible pesetas are subject to au- thorization. Short-term commercial suppliers' credits may be contracted without restriction. The contracting of medium-term suppliers' credits with nonresident EC na- tionals requires prior administrative verification, and the contracting of other types of suppliers' credit is subject to prior authorization. Individuals and juridical persons residing in Spain may freely negotiate financial loans in foreign currency or convertible pesetas, subject to compliance with the fol- lowing conditions: (1) the amount of the loan is not in excess of Ptas 1.5 million; (2) the average maturity of the loan is at least one year, starting from the date of the first disbursement; (3) the loan is denominated in one of the convertible foreign currencies quoted on the Spanish foreign exchange market, or in convertible pesetas and will remain in that currency until maturity; and (4) the resident borrower is not a Spanish branch of the nonres- ident lending institution. Loans may be freely amortized one year after the date of disbursement. The borrower may, at any time, transfer the domiciliation of the loan to another authorized institution, in which case, at the request of the borrower, the current authorized institution of domiciliation must transmit directly to the new bank of domiciliation the original Bank of Spain document on which all movements of funds effected through that institution are recorded. 443 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SPAIN Direct investments abroad are defined according to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Develop- ment (OECD) guidelines, taking into account whether an effective control over the foreign company has been obtained. Effective control is deemed to exist if the share of the Spanish investment is at least 20 percent of the foreign company's capital or if the Directorate-General of External Transactions considers that an important or predominant source of influence exists. Direct invest- ments are defined to include the participation in a foreign company, as well as in the increase in its capital, the establishment of branches and subsidiaries, and the grant- ing of long-term loans, with a view to maintaining or establishing lasting economic links. Direct investments abroad are permitted freely (except those in companies whose activity is portfolio or real estate investments). Direct investments projects, how- ever, must be communicated to the Directorate-General of External Transactions for verification and statistical control. If no administrative notification is received after 30 days following the submission of application, it may be considered approved. Direct investments must be carried out within six months, unless an extension is authorized. Real estate investments abroad can be made freely, provided cumulative investment does not exceed Ptas 25 million or 30 percent of the investor's reported net wealth (individuals), own resources (registered finan- cial institutions), or capital and reserves (other institu- tions), whichever is larger. Reinvestments of the principal of a previous direct investment in a new direct or liberalized portfolio in- vestment are free of restrictions, but require prior veri- fication in the former case (except when the purpose of the new direct investment is identical to that of the previous one). Portfolio investments are defined as (1) the purchase of securities issued by nonresidents, irrespective of the market of issuance; or (2) the purchase of securities issued by residents in a foreign market. Securities are defined to include equity, fixed, or floating rate ins trumen ts, or participations in investment trusts. (Assets with a re- maining maturity of less than one year are not considered securities.) Residents are free to purchase, without prior authorization or verification, securities denominated in foreign currencies (officially quoted in the Spanish foreign exchange market, excluding the^ECU ), which are either quoted in a domestic or foreign stock exchange or ne- gotiated in an "organized market." There are no limits on the purchase of securities issued by Spanish borrowers or by international organizations of which Spain is a member. In the case of other foreign securities, the outstanding stock held by residents must not exceed Ptas 5 million or 30 percent of the investor's reported net wealth (individuals), own resources (registered financial institutions), or capital and reserves (other institutions), whichever is larger. Securities must be deposited with designated Spanish financial intermediaries for tax re- porting and withholding purposes. All returns on foreign 444 investments must be converted into pesetas through those intermediaries. International organizations of which Spain is a member are authorized to borrow in pesetas in the domestic capital market, with the proceeds being considered fully con- vertible. Other than that, financial loans by residents to nonresidents require prior authorization by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The same applies to long-term (more than five years' maturity) and medium-term (be- tween one and five years' maturity) commercial credits by residents to nonresidents. Medium-term commercial credits extended to EC importers are exempt from this requirement. Short-term commercial credits, as well as all types of financial or commercial credits extended by authorized banks and funded through nonresidents' con- vertible currency deposits in those banks, are free of restrictions. Nonbank residents are not allowed to hold foreign currency deposits with resident banks or foreign currency (and peseta) deposits with nonresident banks without prior approval. Proceeds from the sale of real estate are transferable abroad, provided that they were not financed from Or- dinary Peseta Accounts. Proceeds, including capital gains, from the liquidation of shares and bonds may be trans- ferred abroad; however, if the purchase was made with internal pesetas, the owner of the shares must hold them for three years, after which he may transfer the liquidation proceeds abroad. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold in any form in Spain. Purchases of gold, silver, and platinum ingots are subject to a value-added tax at the rate of 33 percent. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement May 26. The ECU began to be officially quoted in the Spanish foreign exchange market. October 20. The Bank of Spain announced new regu- lations on the spot and forward exchange markets; existing limitations on access to the forward market and cover periods were removed. Administration of Control December 10. Transfer of technology and technical assistance contracts with Spanish companies were liber- alized, and the existing authorization procedures admin- istered by the Ministry of Indus try and Energy were eliminated. Nonresident Accounts April 27. Commercial banks were prohibited from paying interest on Convertible Peseta Account balances exceeding Ptas 10 million.

The maximum limit on foreign exchange allowances for tourist travel was abolished. Capital January 7. New regulations on commercial banks' foreign exchange exposure were introduced. The regu- lations, while setting prudential ceilings on net foreign exchange risk, lifted restrictions on specific spot and forward positions, and allowed banks to take short foreign currency positions. February 2. International organizations of which Spain is a member were authorized to borrow in the domestic peseta capital market. March 13. The limit on each foreign loan not related to merchandise trade was raised to Ptas 1.5 million. May 25. Investments abroad by nonresidents were liberalized, with real estate investments being partially liberalized for the first time. July 2. The limitations (e.g., trade-related clauses) on foreign direct investments authorized before the 1985 liberalization measures were abolished. July 22. Investments by nonresidents in domestic Trea- sury bonds and Treasury bills in book-entry form were regulated, and short-term "repos" by nonresidents on domestic financial assets were prohibited. 445 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SRI LANKA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Sri Lanka is the Sri Lanka Rupee, for which the U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. The exchange rate of the Sri Lanka rupee is adjusted period- ically by the Central Bank, taking account of domestic price developments relative to those of Sri Lanka's six major trading partners (France, the Federal Republic of Germany, India, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States), as well as those of neighboring and competitor countries. The Central Bank determines daily the spot buying and selling rates of the U.S. dollar against the Sri Lanka rupee for its transactions with the com- mercial banks; it purchases and sells the U.S. dollar on a spot basis at the buying and selling rates so established. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were SL Rs 30.7475 and SL Rs 30.7775, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The commercial banks provide a forward exchange market for commercial transactions in which rates are freely determined. Commercial banks are required to buy forward foreign exchange proceeds from all exporters whenever exports exceed SL Rs 500,000, whether or not exporters avail themselves of the Central Bank's export refinance facilities. They may cover such purchases by selling forward to their clients (i.e., importers and shipping agents) or to other authorized dealers. The average contract for the sale of foreign exchange to importers must not exceed a period of 180 days. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka provides forward cover to commercial banks in U.S. dollars for their sales in respect of essential imports and purchase of foreign exchange for a period up to three months. The Central Bank quotes forward buying rates taking into account interest differentials, but does not quote forward selling rates. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Department of Exchange Control of the Central Bank as agent of the Government. All remittances of foreign exchange in Sri Lanka must normally be made through commercial banks authorized to carry out operations in foreign currencies in accordance with the exchange control procedures prescribed by the Controller of Exchange. Remittances may also be made through post offices, under permits issued by the Controller of Exchange. The Foreign Investment Advisory Committee handles applications relating to foreign investment in areas other than those coming within the purview of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC), which admin- isters the Investment Promotion Zone. Prescription of Currency Payments to, and receipts from, member countries of the Asian Clearing Union (i.e., Bangladesh, Burma, India, 446 the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nepal, and Pakistan) in respect of current transactions must be effected in Asian Monetary Un i ts or in the currency of the respective member of the Asian Clearing Un ion. For settlements with all other countries, payments for imports may be made in any foreign currency or in Sri Lanka rupees. Other payments may be made either in the currency of the country to which the payment is due or by crediting Sri Lanka rupees to an External Rupee Account. Proceeds from exports must be received in des- ignated foreign currencies.1 Other receipts may be accepted in Sri Lanka rupees from an External Rupee Account or in a designated foreign currency (see footnote 1). Nonresident Accounts Nonresident accounts in Sri Lanka rupees may be held in any commercial bank in Sri Lanka by (1) nonnationals resident outside Sri Lanka; (2) firms and companies registered outside Sri Lanka; (3) Sri Lanka nationals resident outside Sri Lanka, who are classified for this purpose into two categories (those whose current or savings accounts are redesignated as nonresident accounts following their departure, and those whose accounts are opened after their departure); (4) emigrants; and (5) foreign banks. The opening of these accounts for categories (1) and (2), the crediting of the initial and subsequent deposits arising from inward remittances, and debits for local disbursements may be effected without the prior approval of the Department of Exchange Control; however, local credits to these accounts and debits for remittances abroad require the prior approval of the Department. The opening and redesignating of accounts in category (3), credits arising from inward remittances, and local credits and debits to such accounts may be effected without the prior approval of the Department of Exchange Control; debits of these accounts for remittances abroad without ex- change control approval are not permitted. Accounts in category (4) are designated in the first instance as non- resident blocked accounts only when instructions to that effect are received from the Department of Exchange Control. Local debits to such accounts may be effected without the prior approval of the Department of Exchange Control; however, local credits to them and debits for outward remittances require the prior approval of the Department. Under category (5) foreign banks may be permitted to open and operate nonresident accounts with a local commercial bank without the prior approval of the Department of Exchange Control. Nonresident blocked accounts are used for holding funds that have not been accepted for transfer abroad, 1 Australian dollars, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, Ne ther lands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution usually funds owned by nonresidents, repatriates, and emigrants. Authorized dealers are permitted to debit these accounts for local disbursements and credit them on account of pensions, income tax re funds, and profits and dividends w i thout prior approval. Funds in blocked ac- counts may be invested in any local enterprise w i thout the prior approval of the Controller of Exchange. Subject to exchange control approval, proceeds from the liqui- dation of such inves tmen ts can be credited to blocked accounts. Remittances up to a max imum of SL Rs 200,000 are allowed from these accounts without the prior ap- proval of the exchange control authorities. Remittance of interest accrued to blocked accounts is fu l ly transferable after deduction of taxes. Also retained in blocked accounts is a proportion of local currency earnings derived from the exhibition of foreign-owned films; such retained funds may be used by the owner for certain specified purposes, including the making of films in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka nationals resident abroad are allowed to maintain nonresident foreign currency accounts in Sri Lanka in convertible currencies.2 Such accounts can also be opened by Sri Lankans within 90 days of their arrival in Sri Lanka w i th foreign exchange brought in by them or received from abroad. Credits to the accounts are limited to the proceeds of remittances from abroad and money brought into the country by individuals at the time of arrival; in addition, interest payments in these four convertible currencies may be credited to the accounts. These accounts may be freely debited without exchange control approval for paymen ts abroad or for paymen ts within Sri Lanka (converted to Sri Lanka rupees). Commercial banks operating in Sri Lanka may establish a Foreign Currency Banking Un i t. These un i ts may accept time and demand deposits in any designated foreign currency from nonresidents and from resident enterprises in the Inves tment Promotion Zone, and they may extend loans and advances in any designated foreign currency to any nonresident and to any resident enterprise having GCEC status. In addition, the Foreign Currency Banking Units are allowed to accept time and demand deposits from and grant loans and advances to any other resident approved by the Central Bank for such purposes as may be approved by the Central Bank. Imports and Import Payments* Except for certain specified imports, no prior licensing is required. Imports that are subject to prior licensing include those subject to control for security reasons; precious metals; alcohol; apparatus and equipment used in photographic and cinematographic laboratories; screens for projectors; multicolored photocopying apparatus; ar- ticles of cement (whether reinforced or not); concrete cement blocks; encasements of industrial waste slugs, 2 In deutsche mark, pounds sterling, Swiss f rancs, and U.S. dollars. 3 As part of the set of measures introduced under the 1988 budget, the max imum import du ty rate was lowered from 100 percent to 60 percent, except for luxu ry items, and the m in imum rate was raised from zero to 5 percent, except for fertilizers, dried fish, books, and aids for the handicapped. SRI LANKA slag dress, ash and residues; other slag and ash including kelp; and certain consumer goods, in addition to several major food items (rice, flour, and wheat grains). Imports of specified items4 are restricted to government or state corporations; these are referred to as "reserved items." Prior approval procedures apply to certain im- ports of capital goods: certain machinery imports relating to foreign investment require the approval of the Foreign Inves tment Advisory Committee, and certain machinery imports relating to local investment require the prior approval of the Local Investment Advisory Committee; no prior approval is required if any single consignment does not exceed SL Rs 700,000. Holders of balances in Convertible Rupee Accounts, which were abolished for new credits as of November 16, 1977, may use these funds to pay for certain imports, subject to licensing by the Controller of Imports and Exports. Except for specified transactions, imports can be ef- fected only against sight letters of credit. An authorized dealer may approve an application to remit foreign ex- change or to credit a nonresident account against an application for the opening of a letter of credit, and proof of a valid import license, when applicable.

Payments for Invisibles Certain payments for invisibles require exchange con- trol permission. For travel abroad, residents of Sri Lanka are allowed a basic foreign exchange allowance of US$300 per adult and US$150 per child under 12 years, once every two years, for travel to the "Indian group of countries" (defined as Bangladesh, Bhu tan, Burma, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan).

Additional foreign exchange is pro- vided to pay for air fares. The prior approval by the Central Bank is not required for these sales of exchange, as this function has been delegated to the banks. Allow- ances for official travel require a certificate from the head of the relevant institution. Banks can also provide foreign exchange for business travel when the request is accom- panied by a letter from the chairman, director, partner, or sole proprietor of the company recommending the particular trip abroad, and with confirmation that the cost of the exchange will be borne by the respective business establishment. In those cases, exchange is allowed at the rate of US$100 a day, up to a maximum of 30 days, for the Indian group of countries, and US$150 a day, also up to a maximum of 30 days, for other destinations, in addition to an entertainment allowance of US$225 for 4 These include dates, chilies, onions, potatoes, certain petroleum products, film, consumer textiles, caustic soda, tea chests, ju te hessian, mamoties, and matches. 447 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution SUDAN (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Sudan is the Sudanese pound, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar at LSd 4.50 = US$1. This exchange rate applies to all external transactions, except those that take place under the bilateral payments ar- rangement with Egypt, for which the clearing exchange rate of LSd 3.25 per US$1 is used. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Sudan, with the assistance of the authorized banks. The issuance of registration forms and the licensing of imports and exports (except of gold) are the responsibility of the Ministry of Commerce, Cooperation, and Supply, but all registration forms and licenses must be validated by the Bank of Sudan. Official import payments and other foreign payments are approved within the framework of an annual foreign exchange budget drawn up by the Ministry of Finance and Economy, in coordination with the Bank of Sudan and the Ministry of Commerce, Cooperation, and Supply. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Payments to all countries —except Egypt, with which Sudan maintains a bilateral payments agreement —and all monetary areas (the "convertible area") may be made in Sudanese pounds from any nonresident account or in any foreign currency, while receipts from the convertible area may be accepted in Sudanese pounds from any nonresi- dent account or in any convertible currency. Foreign Currency Accounts Residents are allowed to keep foreign exchange in "free" or "special" foreign exchange accounts, depend- ing on the source of funds. Balances in the free accounts may be replenished only from: (1) direct transfers from abroad; (2) foreign exchange registered on customs dec- larations; and (3) salary payments in foreign currency by Arab organizations. A free account may be replenished with foreign currency transferred from another free ac- count. Balances in free accounts may be used for: (1) import payments in accordance with the rules and regu- lations governing imports financed from "own-re- sources"; (2) payments of expenses due to nonresidents relating to imports financed from own-resources; (3) transfers abroad; (4) withdrawal (in the form of traveler's checks or cash, the latter up to a limit of US$200) for travel abroad by the account holder and his family after verification of fulfillment of travel requirements; (5) pay- ments made in bank checks to the Duty-Free Shop Corporation; (6) payments of hotel bills and travel tickets by certified check in foreign currency; and (7) purchases of Sudanese pounds at the commercial bank rate. Balances in the special accounts may be augmented only from transfers from abroad by international organizations and members of the diplomatic corps, specified Arab orga- nizations, and foreign companies operating in oil drilling and mining, construction, engineering, and similar activ- ities; such balances can also be used for purposes similar to those for free accounts. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Certain imports are prohibited for protective reasons, and others are not being licensed. Permitted imports are financed from different sources according to categories. Imports by public sector entities and other imports con- sidered essential are financed from foreign exchange resources of the Bank of Sudan. Imports of certain items, consisting mainly of raw materials and inputs and essential consumer goods, may be financed from the importer's own resources. All other imports are financed from commercial banks' resources with the approval of the Bank of Sudan. Import licenses specify the method of financing. Import licenses must be obtained from the Ministry of Commerce, Cooperation, and Supply for all goods im- ported into Sudan, and are granted upon favorable deci- sion from an interministerial imports committee (Com- mittee for the Determination of Import Priorities). Prior to licensing, public sector imports must secure approval from the Ministry of Finance, and imports under a foreign aid program must be approved by the Commodity Aid Committee. All import licenses must be validated at the Administration for Foreign Exchange (AFE) of the Bank of Sudan. Import insurance normally must be taken out with local companies. Imports financed from the resouces of the commercial banks are subject to an advance deposit of 5 percent of the c.i.f. value. Goods that otherwise would be subject to the advance deposit requirement are exempt when financed with suppliers' credit of at least two years' maturity, provided that the amount of the transaction is at least LSd 500,000. If a letter of credit is opened, the authorized bank usually requires a cash margin deposit ranging from 10 percent to 100 percent of transaction value, depending on the import category. For imports from own resources, a deposit of 2 percent of the value of imports is required at the time of applying for the license. This deposit is not refundable if imports do not take place. A stamp duty of LSd 25 is levied on the application form for each transfer in respect of private sector imports. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles made through the commercial banks do not require prior approval from the AFE. Insurance payments require a certificate from the insur- ance comptroller; transfers for medical treatment require 451 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SUDAN a certified cost estimate from the Medical Commission; transfer of royalties payable to foreign bodies requires a royalty exchange permit from the government body con- cerned (generally, the Ministry of Industry). Authorized banks may accept foreign exchange up to US$1,000 or the equivalent in other hard currencies from residents, irrespective of their source, to be exchanged for traveler's checks or bank checks for traveling abroad. In addition, allocations to travelers to Egypt are authorized by the commercial banks up to a maximum of LSd 500 a person a year in clearing dollars. Departing travelers must provide evidence that foreign exchange in excess of US$1,000 in their possession was acquired through a commercial bank, drawn from a foreign exchange account, has been reported on a declaration form prior to entry into Sudan, or has been approved by the Bank of Sudan. The exportation of Sudanese currency over LSd 20 is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Except when exporting cotton, gum arabic, and livestock, all exporters must submit export contracts accompanied by an export license and obtain approval from the Bank of Sudan through an authorized commercial bank handling the transaction. All commodities are subject to minimum export prices. Export proceeds must be repatriated to the banking system within four months from the date of shipment. All convertible currency proceeds from exports of cotton, gum arabic, sesame, groundnuts, and livestock must be surrendered to the Bank of Sudan, and proceeds from other exports must be surrendered to the commercial banks. When the terms of payment are cash against documents or sight letters of credit, the proceeds must be surrendered on delivery of the shipping documents; otherwise, a surrender date is usually specified. Some major export commodities are exported solely by public sector entities. There is an export tax on gum arabic, cotton, hides and skins, and ivory. Proceeds from Invisibles Sudanese nationals working abroad (SNWA) are al- lowed to keep free foreign exchange accounts. The repatriation of funds from SNWAs is transacted through the commercial banks; since June 1985, a bonus is offered in the form of a pound-denominated coupon equal to 15 percent of the amount of transfer. Coupons may be used by the SNWA to pay customs duties, make purchases in duty-free shops, or exchange them for a car import license (if an amount equivalent to US$8,000 is sold), or for an entitlement to buy land from the Government at a favorable price (if an amount equivalent to US$20,000 is sold). Travelers entering Sudan may bring in any amount in notes and coin of other currencies, but the importation of more than LSd 20 in Sudanese currency is prohibited. The declaration of foreign exchange is a legal requirement for all arrivals into Sudan. An official declaration is required for the foreign exchange to be credited to a foreign currency account or to be re-exported. 452 Capital Repatriation of share capital and loan principal to nonresidents is subject to the submission of a certificate from the Bank of Sudan stating the value of the foreign share in the capital and the loans received in the Sudan; equity shares require a certification of liquidation and of tax compliance. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Sudan for numismatic purposes. Subject to certain con- ditions, residents may also purchase, hold, and sell domestically produced gold in Sudan. With these excep- tions, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Ministry of Commerce, Cooperation, and Supply; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Some newly mined gold is exported for processing and subsequent reimportation. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement October 3. The official and commercial bank exchange rates, previously set at US$1 = LSd 2.50 and US$1 = LSd 4.05, respectively, were unified at the rate of US$1 = LSd 4.50. At the same time, the exchange arrangement was changed from a currency basket peg to a peg to the U.S. dollar. The new exchange rate applies to all external transactions, except those taking place under the bilateral payments agreement with Egypt, for which the rate was set at LSd 3.25 per US$1. Imports and Import Payments August 9. The authorities allowed own-resources im- ports for a wide range of agricultural and industrial inputs as well as for some essential consumer goods. Under this system, importers are allowed to use their own foreign exchange resources, either held abroad or acquired from other sources, to finance imports of commodities for which licences have been issued by the Ministry of Commerce. The list of goods eligible for own-resources import licenses was changed on several occasions later in the year, resulting in an expansion in its coverage. Octobers. A number of import duty rates were changed. On average, the new rates were lower than those in effect prior to this date. Later in the year, upward adjustments were made in some duty rates. The net effect during the year was to lower the average rate of du ty. Payments for Invisibles April 1.

On December 31, 1987 the official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were Sf 1.77 and Sf 1.80, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are set daily by the Central Bank on the basis of the market quotations for the U.S. dollar and the currencies concerned in Amsterdam and the above-mentioned rate of Sf 1.78876 = US$1, net of any commissions. There is no exchange market in Suriname. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The commercial banks charge commissions of 1 percent on sales of foreign currency and 0.25 percent on transfers. Suriname formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from June 29, 1978. Administration of Control All foreign exchange transactions are subject to license, as are transactions between residents and nonresidents in domestic currency and other domestic assets. Import licenses, which are required for all imports, are granted by the Ministry of Trade and Indus try .2 In case of payment by letter of credit, the import license must be approved by the Central Bank. In principle, imports of medical supplies, fuels, raw materials, spare parts, and educational supplies are given priority in the licensing system, but the full basis for allocation is not published. The Central Bank is empowered to provide foreign exchange for import payments (subject to presentation of an import license, which serves as a general authorization for payment); the latter authority is exercised through the commercial banks, which have been appointed as authorized banks by the Foreign Exchange Board. External payments other than for the importation of goods require a license from the Foreign Exchange Board. Except for limited amounts of foreign exchange for invisible payments not requiring an exchange license, the authorized banks are not per- mitted to sell foreign exchange without the submission of an exchange license by the remitter. Exports also require a license from the Ministry of Transport, Trade and Industry. Commercial banks may accept free of license those inward transfers of foreign exchange that do not result from borrowing abroad; the taking up of foreign loans is subject to approval by the Foreign Exchange Board. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. 1 Deutsche mark, French francs, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Barbados dollars, and Guyana dollars. 2 However, two specified mining companies do not need licenses for their own import requirements.

Nonresidents other than banks may freely open accounts in Suriname guilders with domestic banks; certain debits and credits are covered by a general license, and all others are subject to a specific license. These accounts must not be overdrawn and, except for certain specified purposes, debits must not exceed a total of Sf 3,000 a month. Authorized banks may open nonresident accounts in Suriname guilders in the name of nonresident banks; these accounts also must not be overdrawn. Authorized banks may open nonresi- dent accounts on behalf of nonresidents drawing pensions from the Government or under company plans. A special permit is required to transfer pensions abroad.

Not for Redistribution A government agency, the Suriname Central Import Service, acts as the main importer of staple foodstuffs, agricultural inputs, and certain other commodities. Import prices for food products imported by other companies are checked against quotations collected by the Suriname Central Import Service. The import license serves as a general authorization for paymen t. In case of payment by letter of credit, the import license must be approved by the Central Bank. Import licenses have a validity of six mon ths, within which period the goods must be landed and paid for. A license fee of 1.5 percent and a statistical fee of 1.5 percent are levied on the c.i.f. value of all imports, including imports of gold. Payments for Invisibles Transactions involving outward remittances of foreign exchange are subject to licensing; application for a license must be made at least one month prior to the intended date for effecting such a transaction. Authorized banks and the General Post Office have authority to provide foreign exchange up to Sf 150 an item a month on account of certain services (bank charges, legal fees, membership dues, copy and patent rights, and so forth), as well as for advertising expenses and paymen ts for books. Travel allowances for residents are subject to licensing and are limited to the equivalent of Sf 50 a person a calendar year for travel to Guyana and French Guiana, and Sf 270 a person a calendar year for travel to other countries. A traveler may be granted the max imum amount of Sf 320 a year for travel to other countries, provided that he forfeits the right to purchase foreign exchange for travel to Guyana and French Guiana (50 percent of these amounts for children under 12 years). The authorized bank must enter on the travel ticket the amount of foreign exchange sold and the date, the pur- chase of exchange for travel not being permitted until three days before departure. Bona fide applications for larger amounts of exchange for travel purposes are ap- proved on a case-by-case basis. Both resident and non- resident travelers may take out Sf 100 in Suriname currency. The export by resident travelers of foreign bank notes is limited to the amount of their travel allowance. Remittances for support of family members abroad require an individual license, which is granted only for full-time registered students of disciplines essen- tial to but not taught in Suriname. Payments due as interest on loans and as net income from other investments, and payments of moderate amounts for amortization of loans or depreciation or direct in- vestments, may be made if an application, supported by an auditor's report, is duly presented to the Foreign Exchange Board for verification. These payments are temporarily suspended. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports require export licenses, which for most com- modities are issued freely if they are covered by letters of credits opened by importers abroad, provided that the SURINAME exporter undertakes to surrender the foreign currency proceeds to the Central Bank. Export licenses for cattle, pigs, fresh beef and pork, and planting materials are granted only with the advice of the Director of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Fisheries. The export of ba- boon wood is prohibited, and that of rice is subject to special regulations. Certain exporting companies have received special permission from the Foreign Exchange Board to maintain current accounts in foreign currency with their parent companies abroad and to use these for specified payments and receipts (including export pro- ceeds). Exports of logs are subject to a tax of 10 percent to 50 percent of f.o.b. value, depending on the type of wood; and exports of rough-hewn timber are subject to a tax of 10 percent of f.o.b. value. All exports are subject to a statistical fee of 1.5 percent of the f.o.b. value. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to an authorized bank. Travelers may bring in foreign currency without limit and up to Sf 100 in domestic currency. Travelers must declare all domestic and foreign currency in their possession on entry; resident travelers must exchange at an authorized bank any foreign currency in their possession. The amount which nonres- idents may take out of the country in foreign currency must be smaller than the amount brought in and declared on entry. Nonresident travelers, except residents of Guyana and French Guiana, are required to change convertible currency in an amount equivalent to Sf 500 when entering Suriname at Zanderij International Airport or at Nickerie or Albina. Residents of Guyana and French Guiana should exchange convertible currency in an amount equivalent to Sf 200 (50 percent of these amounts for children under 12 years). Unspent balances of such guilders can be reconverted into convertible currency, provided that the visit was shorter than ten days in each case and the visitor spent more than Sf 50 a day. Capital A decision of September 21, 1960 of the Foreign Exchange Board provides for the transfer abroad of capital proceeds from the sale to residents or the liquidation of fu l ly or partly foreign-owned companies or other forms of enterprise. The decision covers investments made by nonresidents with foreign capital after July 31, 1953. It also provides for the annual transfer of profits and for the transfer at any time of the foreign exchange (including loans) imported by the nonresident entrepreneur for the company's use. Profits must be transferred within three years; otherwise, they are considered to have become part of the firm's working capital arid may only be transferred in annual installments of 20 percent. Transfers in accordance with these decisions have been temporarily suspended. The Foreign Exchange Board may, at its discretion, grant licenses for transfers abroad from a deceased's estate, up to a maximum of Sf 10,000. For estates of more than Sf 10,000, further annual transfers are permitted 455 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SURINAME so as to spread them over a period not exceeding ten years. The Board may allow emigrants (heads of family) to transfer in foreign exchange the equivalent of Sf 5,000 in a lump sum, and subsequently, Sf 5,000 a year. The head of a repatriating family may be permitted to transfer the equivalent of Sf 10,000 plus 10 percent of his total taxable earnings in Suriname accrued during his period of residence; if his Surinamese assets exceed the sum thus calculated, the excess may be transferred at a rate of Sf 10,000 a year. Transfers abroad in excess of Sf 10,000 a year may be authorized under exceptional cir- cumstances. Outward transfers for these purposes have been temporarily reduced. Subject to certain requirements, residents may purchase or sell in specified countries6 Surinamese corporate shares that have been designated as negotiable by the Foreign Exchange Board. Transfers for investment abroad or for the purchase of other foreign securities or real estate by residents are not permitted, although exceptions may be made for direct investments abroad when it is considered that Surinamese interests will benefit. All borrowing from nonresidents by nonbank residents requires prior approval by the Foreign Exchange Board. The foreign transactions of authorized banks are restricted, in principle, to those undertaken for the account of their customers, and banks are required, in principle, to surrender to the Central Bank any excess of foreign currency purchased. Authorized banks are permitted to place a part of their liquid funds abroad and to use the short-term credit lines extended by their foreign correspondent banks as a source of operating funds. Following curtailment of such credit lines in early 1983, the Central Bank, the authorized banks, and the correspondent banks have made an ar- rangement whereby the Central Bank guarantees the letters of credit issued by the authorized banks by pledging its balances up to a specified ceiling, while the authorized banks keep their balances abroad at a minimum level.7 The ceiling on the outstanding letters of credit guaranteed by reserve pledges amounts to the equivalent of US$16.3 million; the authorized banks have generally been able to honor their letters of credit, so that the pledged central bank balances have not so far been drawn upon. The authorized banks have a general license to place abroad in short-term U.S. dollar assets the amounts correspond- ing to balances in their nonresident U.S. dollar accounts. Gold Producers of gold may sell only to the authorized gold buyers (the Central Bank and Grassalco). Locally pro- 6 Belgium, Canada, France, Federal Repub l ic of Ge rmany, I ta ly, Lux- embourg, Ne the r lands, Netherlands An t i l les, United K ingdom, and Un i ted States. 7 This arrangement applies to the nationally controlled Landbouw Bank, De Surinaamsche Bank, and Hakr inbank, and not to the Dutch-owned Algemene Bank Nederland. duced gold must be surrendered to the Foreign Exchange Board by sale to the Central Bank. At the end of December 1987 the price was Sf 40 per gram. The authorized gold buyers are permitted, however, to sell nuggets at freely agreed prices for industrial and artistic purposes; dealings between residents in gold bars and other forms of un- worked gold, with the exception of nuggets, are prohib- ited. As local production does not meet demand for industrial purposes, the Central Bank may import some gold. Three kinds of gold coin —with a face value of Sf 100, Sf 200, and Sf 250, respectively —are legal tender. Resi- dents may hold and acquire gold coins in Suriname for numismatic and investment purposes; authorized banks may freely negotiate gold coin among themselves and with other residents. Residents other than the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and authorized industrial and dental users are not allowed without special permis- sion to hold or acquire gold in any form other than nuggets, jewe lry, or coin, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require exchange licenses issued by the Foreign Exchange Board; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports of coin by authorized banks and for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and industrial users. Residents arriving from abroad, however, may freely bring in gold, subject to declaration and provided that they surrender it to the Central Bank within 20 days. Nonresident travelers also may freely bring in gold, subject to declaration; they may re-export the declared amount freely. Imports of gold coin are duty free and those of unworked gold are subject to a du ty of Sf 1.00 a gram, irrespective of origin. The general tariff for gold ornaments is 60 percent ad valorem. Imports and exports of all forms of gold are subject to a statistical fee of 1.5 percent; in addition, imports are subject to a licensing fee of 1.5 percent. Changes During 1987 Payments for Invisibles January 15. A limit on travel allowances for a person traveling to countries other than Guyana and French Guiana was reduced from Sf 475 a person a calendar year to Sf 270. Accordingly, the max imum amount a person a year was reduced from Sf 525 to Sf 320 for travel to other countries. Gold April 1. The purchase price by the Central Bank of locally produced gold was reduced from Sf 60 per gram to Sf 40 per gram. 456 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWAZILAND (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Swaziland is the Lilangeni (plural emalangeni), which is pegged to the South African rand at E 1 = R 1. Exchange rates for the U.S. dollar quoted by the Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS) are based on the floating middle rate of the South African commercial rand against the U.S. dollar. On December 31, 1987 the closing buying and selling rates were US$0.5210 and US$0.5189, respectively, per E 1. Rates are also quoted for the Canadian dollar, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Japanese yen, the pound sterling, and the Swiss franc, based on the London and New York market quotations for these currencies against the U.S. dollar. The CBS also quotes rates for the currencies of member states of the Preferential Trade Area of Eastern and Southern African States (PTA), based on the relationship with the SDR as advised by the clearing house operated by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. These currencies include the Kenya shilling, Malawi kwacha, and Zim- babwe dollar. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The Central Bank of Swa- ziland offers cover for authorized dealers' forward posi- tions in South African rand and certain other currencies. Exchange Control Territory Swaziland is part of the Common Monetary Area (CMA), which is a single exchange control territory comprising Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland. No restrictions are applied to payments within the CM A, and in principle, these are not controlled. In relations with countries outside the CMA, Swaziland applies exchange controls that are generally similar to those of South Africa, but Swaziland has not adopted the dual exchange rate system that was reintroduced in that country in September 1985. Residents of Swaziland, however, have access to the Johannesburg market in accordance with the terms and conditions ruling in that market. Financial rand may not be acquired by, or held for account of, any resident of Lesotho, South Africa, or Swaziland. Control The Central Bank of Swaziland, on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, controls all external currency transactions. Imports and Import Payments Swaziland is a member of a customs un ion with Bo- tswana, Lesotho, and South Africa, and there are no import restrictions on goods originating in any country of the customs union. Imports from South Africa do not require licenses and include an unknown quantity of goods originating outside the customs un ion. Insofar as Swaziland imports goods directly from countries outside the customs union, such imports are usually licensed in conformity with specific import regulations. Import licen- ses granted in Swaziland entitle the holder to buy the foreign exchange required to make the import payment. Ports of entry outside Swaziland may be utilized, but the overall control over import licenses and payments pro- cedures is a responsibility of the Swazi authorities. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports are subject to licensing. For those goods that are shipped to any one member of the customs area, licenses are used mainly for tax levy purposes. For goods shipped to countries outside the customs area, licensing is administered to ensure that export proceeds are repa- triated in the prescribed manner and within the stipulated period. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments to nonresidents for current transactions, while subject to control, are not normally restricted. Authority to approve some types of current paymen ts is delegated to authorized dealers up to established limits. The basic exchange allowance for tourist travel to neigh- boring countries is E 4,000 for each adult, and E 2,000 for each child, a year; the corresponding annual allow- ances for tourist travel to other countries are E 10,000 and E 3,000, respectively. For business travel to neigh- boring countries, the basic annual allowance is E 8,000 a person at rates not exceeding E 600 a day; the corre- sponding limits for business travel to other countries are E 15,000 and E 750, respectively. A higher basic allowance can be obtained for business and medical travel. To use credit cards outside the CMA, a resident cardholder must complete a letter of undertaking prior to departure. Capital All inward capital transfers require prior approval of the CBS and must be properly documented in order to facilitate the subsequent repatriation of interest, divi- dends, profits, and other income. No person may borrow foreign currency or register shares in the name of a nonresident, or act as a nominee for a nonresident, without prior approval. Applications for most outward transfers of capital are considered on their merits. Blocked emalangeni may be invested in quoted securities and other such investments as may be approved by the CBS. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 457 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWEDEN (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Sweden is the Swedish Krona. In managing the exchange rate of the krona, the Sveriges Riksbank (the central bank) is guided by a trade-weighted index based on a basket of 15 currencies of Sweden's most important trading partners. In constructing the index, the Swedish authorities established two criteria to be met by each country and currency included in the basket: (1) the country had to account for at least 1 percent of Sweden's total foreign trade (exports plus imports) during the previous five-year period, and (2) each currency had to be quoted daily on the foreign exchange market in Stockholm. The weights are propor- tional to Sweden's foreign trade with each of the countries whose currencies are included in the index, with the exception that the weight of the U.S. dollar has been doubled and that of the other currencies adjusted accord- ingly. To take account of changes in average trade shares, the weights are adjusted each year (on April 1) on the basis of trade statistics for the last five calendar years. At present, the weights are as follows (base period 1982-86): U.S. dollar 22.8 Deutsche mark 15.6 Pound sterling 12.2 Norwegian krone 9.2 Danish krone 7.8 Finnish markka 6.5 French franc 5.2 Netherlands guilder 4.7 Belgian franc 3.6 Italian lira 3.6 Japanese yen 3.1 Swiss franc 2.0 Austrian schilling 1.3 Spanish peseta 1.3 Canadian dollar LI Total 100.0 The index value of 132 represents the benchmark for the effective value following the devaluation on Octo- ber 8, 1982 (August 29, 1977 = 100). The exchange rate is managed so as to allow only limited fluctuations around this benchmark; beginning in June 1985, fluctuations in the spot rate are limited within 1.5 percent on either side of the announced benchmark. An average of the daily index values is published weekly by the Riksbank. The market buying and selling rates for spot transactions in U.S. dollars, the intervention currency, on December 30, 1987 were SKr 5.8395 and SKr 5.8415, respectively, per US$1. Spot rates for other currencies are established on the basis of the cross rates in international markets. Forward market rates are left to the interplay of market forces. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. 458 Authorized banks may buy from and sell to other authorized banks and residents any foreign currency on a spot or forward basis against another foreign currency or Swedish kronor. All transactions with residents in a foreign currency against Swedish kronor are permitted, provided they are conducted through authorized banks. Authorized banks may also purchase (sell) foreign cur- rencies, spot, from (to) foreign banks and other nonres- idents against any foreign currency or Swedish kronor credited (debited) to an External Kronor Account (see section on Nonresident Accounts, below). Authorized banks may conclude with residents forward exchange transactions in foreign currencies against Swe- dish kronor w i thout restriction (on each occasion when a forward transaction is allowed, currency options may be concluded). Forward transactions may be concluded only to cover payments for which an agreement exists. However, export firms may make forward sales of settle- ment on the envisaged date of payment or, when tender- ing, on the expiry date for tendering. Authorized banks may without exceptions conclude with residents forward transactions in any foreign currency against another foreign currency. Authorized banks may buy forward from and sell forward to other authorized banks, foreign banks, and nonresidents any foreign currency against another foreign currency or Swedish kronor. Limits are placed on the net foreign exchange holdings, spot and forward, of each authorized bank. Banks may grant only normal overdrafts to nonresidents, and may incur foreign exchange liabilities, including a net liability in any one currency within individual limits set for each bank. This, together with the permission to pay interest on foreign exchange deposits held by nonresidents, en- ables the banks to borrow foreign currency from nonres- idents for on-lending (but not in the form of kronor) to foreign banks. Swedish banks may, while observing their limits on net foreign exchange holdings, borrow abroad freely in order to sell the proceeds against Swedish kronor in the market. Sweden formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreemen t, as from February 15, 1961. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Riksbank through its Exchange Control Board. Authorized banks and certain other authorized agencies implement the exchange control regulations. All current payments are exempt from exchange control, provided that they are made through authorized banks. These banks have also been granted general licenses to approve various pay- ments that are subject to exchange control. When re- quired, import and export licenses are issued by the National Board of Trade, except those for foodstuffs, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution which are issued by the National Agricultural Market Board. also permitted to accept foreign suppliers' credits, pro- vided that such credits are regarded as customary. SWEDEN Prescription of Currency Payments to and from foreign countries may be made in any foreign currency or in Swedish kronor through an External Kronor Account (see section on Nonresident Accounts, below). Nonresident Accounts There are two main types of nonresident accounts held in Swedish kronor: External Kronor Accounts and Re- stricted Accounts. External Kronor Accounts may be held with authorized banks by nonresidents domiciled abroad. They may be credited with authorized payments to foreign countries by residents, transfers from other External Kronor Ac- counts, and sales of any foreign currency. They may be debited for authorized payments to residents, transferred to any other External Kronor Account, and may be used for conversion into any foreign currency. They do not normally bear interest. Restricted Accounts are held by persons who have become nonresidents after emigrating. The accounts may be credited with, for example, earnings and proceeds from sales of assets in Sweden, inheritances, and amor- tization on loans granted before emigration. Balances in Restricted Accounts may be used for payments in Sweden for such items as expenses related to assets in Sweden, maintenance costs, purchase of Swedish securities and real estate in Sweden, and loans to residents. Imports and Import Payments With the exception of some agricultural and fishery products, practically all goods are free from quantitative restriction and import licensing when imported from countries other than Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, the German Demo- cratic Republic, Hungary, the Democratic People's Re- public of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and Viet Nam. However, most imports from these coun- tries are liberalized. Imports of certain textile products from some countries and territories (Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Macao, Malaysia, Malta, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan Province of China,! Thailand, and Yugoslavia) are limited through special arrangements. In addition, imports of specified textiles from any source other than the European Communities (EC) (except Portugal), the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, Australia, Canada, the Faeroe Islands, Greenland, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States, as well as imports of most iron and steel products from all countries, are subject to import licensing for surveillance purposes. Imports from South Africa are prohibited. Payments for imports may, as current payments, be made freely through an authorized bank. Importers are tSee Explanatory Note on coverage of Part Two, page 61. Payments for Invisibles Invisible payments that are considered as current may be made by residents in favor of nonresidents without restrictions, provided that they are made through an authorized bank. Occasional payments not exceeding the equivalent of SKr 3,000 are considered current regardless of the purpose. Foreign exchange for travel abroad may be allocated by authorized banks and other authorized agencies up to an amount considered reasonable in light of the purpose and duration of the journey. Each person leaving Sweden may take out Swedish bank notes and coin up to SKr 6,000. Nonresidents leaving Sweden may export freely foreign bank notes and other means of payment that have been acquired abroad or from an authorized bank or other authorized agency in Sweden. While abroad, residents may open accounts abroad, provided that at the end of the stay the balance is transferred to Sweden. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, as well as exports of special steel to the United States, are subject to export licensing. All other exports, with some exceptions such as ships and scrap metal, are free from license. Exports to South Africa are prohibited. Proceeds from exports of goods may be sold to an authorized bank for kronor or kept in a foreign currency account with an authorized bank and used by the holder to make authorized payments abroad. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from current invisibles are subject to the same treatment as those from exports (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, above). Each person entering Sweden may, for traveling expenses, bring in unlimited amounts of bank notes, coin, and other means of payment. Capital The various categories of capital transactions are gov- erned by specific regulations as follows: (1) Direct investments. A permit from the Riksbank is required for direct investments abroad by residents. These permits are normally granted. New investment in South Africa and Namibia has been banned since July 1, 1979. Foreign direct investments in Sweden require a permit from the Riksbank, which is always given. (2) Loans. Swedish exporters and importers are nor- mally authorized to raise foreign-currency loans abroad or from an authorized bank in order to finance suppliers' credits and imports, respectively. Loans with a life of up to six months can be obtained from an authorized bank without a special permit from the Riksbank, provided that the purpose is to finance exports or imports of goods. Authorized banks may consequently raise loans abroad in foreign currency for on-lending to enterprises for that purpose. 459 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWEDEN The Riksbank normally grants permits to enterprises and local governments to raise medium- and long-term loans in foreign currency abroad, provided the average life of the loans is at least one year; loans can be raised from an authorized bank by enterprises and local govern- ments without a permit from the Riksbank. Authorized banks may, without limit, lend foreign currencies to Swedish-owned companies abroad or to buyers of Swedish exports or sellers of Swedish imports. Authorized banks may, within individual limits, lend foreign currencies to, or issue guarantees in favor of, foreign borrowers for purposes unrelated to Swedish trade or Swedish-owned companies. (3) Transactions in securities. Residents do not need authorization to sell portfolio holdings of foreign securities to nonresidents. The purchase of foreign securities from nonresidents by residents is generally not permitted. However, authorized banks and stockbrokers may on behalf of residents purchase from nonresidents foreign securities and listed Swedish securities denominated in foreign currencies if payment is made with proceeds from sales to nonresidents of Swedish-held securities denom- inated in a foreign currency and the purchase is made within six months of the corresponding sale. A general license permits the repurchase from abroad of listed Swedish securities denominated in kronor, provided that a bona fide nonresident ownership is confirmed by an affidavit or by registration with the Securities Register Center. The Riksbank normally permits sales to nonresidents of listed Swedish shares. Authorized banks and stock- brokers may also handle purchases by nonresidents of listed Swedish securities expressed in Swedish kronor if the payment is made with the proceeds from sales of other similar securities to residents and if certain other conditions are fulfilled. (4) Emigration. When emigrating, a resident is permit- ted, on application, to transfer up to SKr 200,000. In addition, the emigrant may be permitted to transfer up to SKr 800,000 per family for the purchase of dwellings abroad if the tax authority certifies that the emigrant does not have tax arrears. The remainder of an emigrant's funds may be transferred after confirmation by the tax authorities that the emigrant is no longer residing in Sweden. (5) Other transfers. Authorized banks may approve paymen ts abroad in respect of various categories of remittances. For the purchase of dwellings abroad for personal use, transfers up to SKr 800,000 per family may be approved. Payments constituting gifts may be approved up to SKr 5,000 a calendar year, and transfers to non- residents on account of inheritance are permitted. Resi- dents may, without a permit from the Riksbank, accept capital receipts from abroad related to such purposes as life pensions, annu i ty contracts, contractual amortiza- tions, the sales of foreign securities and real estate abroad, gifts, and inheritances. Gold There are no special regulations on trading in gold. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement February 1.

Not for Redistribution SWITZERLAND1 (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Switzerland is the Swiss Franc. The Swiss National Bank does not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions; exchange rates are determined, in principle, on the basis of under ly ing demand and supply conditions in the exchange markets. However, the Swiss National Bank reserves the right to intervene if and when warranted by prevailing circumstances. The principal intervention currency is the U.S. dollar; on Decem- ber 31, 1987 the midpoint market rate for the Swiss franc in terms of the U.S. dollar was Sw F 1.2780 per US$1. All settlements may be made at free market rates. Foreign bank notes are negotiated freely in Switzerland at rates determined by the interplay of supply and demand. Residents and nonresidents may freely negotiate foreign exchange contracts with banks in all currencies, both in respect of commercial and financial transactions. There are no officially fixed premia and discount rates applicable to forward exchange contracts, and all forward exchange transactions are negotiated at free market rates. Under the Export Risk Guarantee System, export receipts may be insured by the Government under certain conditions. Exchange Control Territory For all purposes of import and export the Principality of Liechtenstein is included in the Swiss customs territory. For purposes of monetary policy measures, natural per- sons domiciled in Liechtenstein are considered by Switz- erland as residents, and so are juridical persons including banks. However, this rule does not apply if the acquisition of Swiss real estate is involved. Liechtenstein is consid- ered a foreign country for purposes of banking supervision. Administration of Control Authority to impose measures for the control of imports, exports, and paymen ts is vested in the Swiss Federal Council acting on the advice of the Federal Department of Public Economy or the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. The Swiss National Bank is the advisory and executive authority in matters of currency for both Switz- erland and Liechtenstein. Capital export transactions of financial institutions, however, are subject to approval by the Swiss National Bank (see section on Capital, below). Prescription of Currency Settlements may be made or received in any currency. Imports and Import Payments With minor exceptions, imports into Switzerland may be made freely. The importation of butter and alcohol is subject to state monopoly. The most important commod- 1 Switzerland is not a member of the In terna t ional Monetary Fund. ities subject to license, irrespective of their origin, are certain agricultural products, petroleum products, and washing preparations and their compounds. Import per- mits for goods under license are generally granted freely, but global quotas are established for certain agricultural products. Imports of textiles from specified countries are subject to price surveillance or price certification. Pay- ments for imports from all countries may be made freely. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles may be made freely. The export of Swiss and foreign bank notes is unrestricted. Exports and Export Proceeds The export (including re-export) of some goods is subject to export control through individual licenses. This export licensing system is operated in part with the assistance of appropriate semi-official or private organi- zations. Export proceeds are freely disposable. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles are freely disposable. The import of Swiss and foreign bank notes is unrestricted. Capital Transfers of capital may be made without formality, except that bank credits and other bank lending to nonresidents, when amounting to or exceeding Sw F 10 million each and with a maturity of 12 months or more, require permission. Permission is also required for foreign bond and note issues in Switzerland and for direct participations or subparticipations by Swiss banks in Eurobond issues and Eurocurrency credits. A stamp tax is payable on transaction in Swiss-issued (foreign-issued) securities at the rate of 0.10 (0.20) percent with a maturity of up to three months and at the rate of 0.15 (0.30) percent with a maturity of over three months. Foreign institutions are allowed to participate as subunderwriters in syndi- cated Swiss franc capital export transactions, provided that they are not mentioned either in the arrangement or publicly. Credits with multicurrency clauses are subject to the same conditions as those denominated in Swiss francs if the Swiss franc is the determining currency for the calculation of the debt amount. The physical impor- tation and exportation of Swiss and foreign securities are unrestricted. The banks are permitted to pay interest on Swiss franc deposits (including *'fiduciary" or ' 'trustee" funds) received from nonresidents. A select number of banks and finance companies are required to report their positions (their own assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, spot and forward) in domestic and foreign currencies on a monthly basis, and their dealer position, on a weekly basis.

Imports and exports of gold in any form by residents and nonres- idents are unrestricted and free of license. No customs duties or other charges are levied on exports of gold. Imports of gold bars and of certain gold coins are exempt from customs du ty. Import and export licenses, which are issued freely, are required for commercial imports and exports of certain articles containing gold. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments January 1.

Not for Redistribution SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Syrian Arab Republic is the Syrian Pound, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the in terven t ion currency, at LS 3.925 = US$1 in the official market.1 The official rate applies, on the receipts side, to official loans and grants and other budgetary proceeds; and on the payments side, to debt service payments, other budgetary expenses, and specified student expenses abroad. The parallel market rate (LS 5.45 = US$1) applies to specified student expenses abroad. The exchange rate of LS 8.85 = US$1 applies to public sector imports of medicine. The tourist market rate (LS 9.875 = US$1) applies, on the receipts side, to hotel services, foreign exchange surrendered at the airport, the airport tax, remittances of foreign establishments, foreign embassy expenses, and surrender of 25 percent of salaries of Syrians on secondment abroad; and on the payments side, to some public and private sector transfers, and specified student expenses abroad. The exchange rate of LS 11.25 = US$1 applies to all exports and all other imports. The exchange rate of LS 16.25 = US$1 applies to airline tickets, and LS 18.0 = US$1 applies to all tranfers abroad by airline companies. The promotion rate (LS 28.0 = US$1) applies, on the receipts side, to remittances, private sector commissions, and tourism earnings, and on the payments side, to travel allowances, medical expenses abroad, printed matter, and other per- sonal expenses. The Syrian Arab Republic confines its buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar within LS 3.90 and LS 3.95, respectively, per US$1 in the official market; on Decem- ber 31, 1987 the official buying and selling rates were LS 3.90 and LS 3.95, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for all major currencies are quoted on the basis of the official market rates, the parallel market rates, the tourist market rates, and the promotion rates for the U.S. dollar and the market rates for the currencies concerned in markets abroad.2 Administration of Control Policy with regard to imports and exports is determined by the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade. Under an agreement between the Central Bank of Syria and the Administrative Committee of the Exchange Office, all 1 On January 1, 1988 the official market rate was changed from LS 3.925 = US$1 to LS 11.225 = US$1. All of the more appreciated rates were, in principle, abolished and the transactions that were conducted at these rates were transferred to the new official market rate. However, certain student expenses abroad are effected at three different rates; i .e ., LS 3.95 = US$1, LS 5.45 = US$1, and LS 10.00 = US$1, depending on the date on wh ich the student started his studies abroad, and these rates will be applied un t il the beneficiaries conclude the ir studies. 2 Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Iraqi dinars, Italian lire, Jordan dinars, Lebanese pounds, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. transactions of the Exchange Office are carried out through the Central Bank. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade, and ex- change licenses for invisibles and capital transactions, by the Exchange Office. Only authorized commercial banks may deal in foreign exchange. The commercial banks may open letters of credit only with the prior approval of the Exchange Office. At present there is one authorized bank, the Commercial Bank of Syria, which has been authorized by the Exchange Office to open letters of credit and accept bills for collection without prior ap- proval, provided that certain conditions are fulfilled. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency The Exchange Office is empowered to prescribe the currencies to be obtained for exports. Proceeds of exports to all countries may be obtained in any convertible currency, and such proceeds may also be received in bank notes denominated in convertible currencies and declared at the border posts of entry. Prescription of currency requirements are not applied to outgoing pay- ments. All payments to and receipts from Egypt, Israel, and South Africa are prohibited. The Syrian Arab Re- public maintains bilateral payments agreements with the Islamic Republic of Iran, Sri Lanka, the U.S.S.R., and Viet Nam, of which the first and the third agreements are operative. Private sector exporters to countries with which the Syrian Arab Republic maintains bilateral pay- ments arrangements are required to ship 20 percent of their exports to countries conducting foreign trade in convertible currencies. Nonresident and Foreign Currency Accounts Nonresident accounts in Syrian pounds may be credited with the proceeds of foreign currencies sold to the authorized bank and with payments for goods. They may be debited without prior approval to pay for Syrian exports to the country of the account holder and for expenses in the Syrian Arab Republic. Residents wishing to open foreign currency accounts are required to present evi- dence in writing that they have sources of income abroad. Nonresidents (individuals and corporations) may open accounts in convertible foreign currencies at authorized local banks for the deposit of funds from abroad. Balances in such accounts may be sold to local banks, transferred abroad without restrictions, or used in payment for specified imports. Temporary nonresident accounts may be opened in the name of nonresidents temporarily residing in the Syrian Arab Republic. These accounts may not be used, how- ever, for funds received in settlement currencies, through payments conventions, or by diplomatic and United Nations (UN) missions and their staffs. Permitted credits 463 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC include the local currency proceeds of foreign currency brought in at the promotion exchange market rate and amounts corresponding to import payments that are not transferred. Debits for local expenditures are completely free, and debits for expenditures abroad also are permitted. Imports and Import Payments Imports of commodities originating in Egypt, Israel, or South Africa are prohibited. Many basic commodities (including green coffee, tea, rice, tobacco, salt, paper, iron and steel, and certain agricultural machinery) are imported only by state-trading agencies or, for their own account, by certain other official agencies. Agencies having the sole authority to import may be required to import certain commodities to meet the raw material needs of the private sector. In 1987, the list of goods that can be imported by the private sector was enlarged to include certain agricultural goods, industrial goods, and raw materials. Imports of goods not on the permitted list are, in principle, prohibited; however, exceptions up to LS 70,000 per merchant may be permitted under certain circumstances. In principle, imports must come direct from the country of origin, without the intervention of any foreign firm; the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade has the authority, however, to permit certain goods to be imported from countries other than the country of origin. Imports from the Syrian free zone are allowed for certain industrial goods and goods with a free zone value added of at least 40 percent. All imports, except those valued at less than LS 2,000 (LS 500 for imports from Lebanon) require licenses, which must be obtained by the importer prior to the date of shipment of the goods. Operations of the state-trading agencies are governed by the annual foreign exchange budget. On the basis of the budget, these agencies submit documentation on their import requirements to the Min- istry of Economy and the customs authorities, and import licenses are automatically issued. Certain imports (not appearing on the list of prohibited imports) from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia are exempt from license, in accordance with the Arab Common Market Agreement. In such cases an authorization to import is granted in response to a written request. Payments for imports by the Government are effected at the official market rate, while a significant share of the imports of the public sector is effected at the rate of LS 11.25 = US$1. In principle, private sector importers are authorized to import specified raw materials, capital goods, consumer goods, and spare parts by opening letters of credit at the Commercial Bank of Syria. In practice, as foreign exchange is not made available at the official market rate, private sector imports must be financed with importers' own resources. There are presently four ave- nues available to the private sector importers: (1) external credit arrangements, including suppliers' credits of 180- 360 days' maturity, and third party financing; (2) use of up to 75 percent of foreign currency deposits maintained in Syria by nonresidents; (3) use of importers' own foreign 464 exchange deposits maintained abroad; importers are re- quired to deposit 102-105 percent of the value of imports with the Commercial Bank of Syria in foreign exchange before applying for the import license; and (4) use of foreign exchange deposited in the Commercial Bank of Syria under the new export proceeds retention regulations introduced in 1987. Since June 1987, import deposits have been waived for some categories of agricultural and industrial equipment, raw materials, and spare parts for both public and private importers. In addition, a non-interest-bearing advance import deposit of 50 percent of the import value is required for most private sector imports before the issuance of import licenses. The exchange rate of LS 5.45 = US$1 is applied to conversion. Licenses to import specified items that are normally prohibited (certain luxury con- sumer goods) are granted, up to a value of LS 70,000 in a 12-month period, on request to merchants certified by the Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Supply and Internal Trade and whose names appear on the list of income tax payers published by the Ministry of Finance; no licenses are required for such imports with a value not exceeding LS 2,000 an item a mon th. Foreign currency accounts may be debited freely for import payments, provided that a license is obtained when necessary. There is a tax of 2 percent on the issue of import licenses, except for government imports and imports of certain essential items, including raw materials, petro- leum, and petroleum products. In addition, there is a un if ied import surcharge, which has replaced all the previous special levies on imports (a statistical tax, a municipal consumption tax, a defense tax, a school tax, and a maritime transport and port tax). Payments for Invisibles Most payments for invisibles must be made at the promotion rate (LS 29.0 = US$1), while trade-related transactions of the public sector are made at the official market rate, and certain other specified payments, at the specified rates. Both residents and nonresidents may freely take out foreign bank notes. Residents traveling abroad may also take with them other foreign exchange purchased at the promotion rate. The travel allowance is US$1,000 a trip for all countries except for Jordan and Lebanon. Travelers to Jordan and Lebanon are not eligible for foreign ex- change travel allowance, but may take with them up to LS 2,000 a trip in Syrian bank notes. For children 10 years old or younger, the allowances are 50 percent of these amounts. Workers on secondment to a foreign country may take with them foreign exchange equivalent to 25 percent of the above-mentioned allocations and the entire amount of the allocations on production of proof that they have transferred foreign exchange from abroad. For travel to paymen ts agreement countries, 50 percent of the travel allocation must be taken up through the clearing account concerned (30 percent for travel on official business). On departure, residents of Syrian na- tionality must pay an exit tax of LS 400 a person if ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution traveling to Arab countries, and LS 1,000 a person for other destinations. Fixed allocations are maintained for other transactions in invisibles, as follows: 60 percent of the salaries received by foreign technicians and experts employed in the Syrian Arab Republic, and 50 percent of the salaries of personnel of foreign diplomatic and international missions in the Syrian Arab Republic. All other transactions require the prior approval of the Exchange Office Committee. Resi- dents and nonresidents are not permitted to take out any Syrian currency. Nonresidents leaving the country are not allowed to reconvert Syrian currency into foreign exchange. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of wheat, barley, cotton, cottonseed, and the ir derivatives are nationalized and are made by the Cereals Office or the Cotton Au thor i ty. Exports of petroleum are handled by the Petroleum Marketing Office. Exports of certain other commodities are also reserved for govern- ment agencies, state-trading agencies, or specified com- panies. Exports of a few goods to all countries and all exports to Egypt, Israel, and South Africa are prohibited. Exports of certain products and of all goods of foreign origin require licenses. For all other exports, licenses are not required. For most exports, however, a repatriation commitment is required, by which the exporter under takes to bring the proceeds to the Syrian Arab Republic and surrender them to the Commercial Bank of Syria w i th in three months from the date of export shipment to Arab countries and within four mon ths from the date of export shipment to other countries. The proceeds from exports of the public and the private sector are subject to surrender at the exchange rate of LS 11.25 = US$1. Exporters of specified products in the private sector may retain up to 50 percent of export proceeds to finance imports of raw materials and inpu ts for their own use. In April 1987, private sector exporters of agricultural and industrial products included in an extensive list were allowed to retain 75 percent of their import proceeds for any kind of imports from a permitted list, even if the products to be imported were not directly related to their exporting activity; the permitted list was expanded in November 1987. At present, most private sector exporters are thus required to surrender to the Commercial Bank of Syria only 25 percent of their proceeds at the rate of LS 11.25 = US$1; the remaining 75 percent can be deposited at the Commercial Bank in special earmarked export exchange accounts until imports are made or foreign exchange is voluntarily sold to the Commercial Bank. Private sector exporters to countries with which the Syrian Arab Republic maintains bilateral payments ar- rangements are required to ship 20 percent of their exports to countries conducting foreign trade in convertible cur- rencies and may use their export proceeds in convertible currencies to import raw materials and spare parts for their own production activity. The retained export pro- ceeds must be deposited in a special export exchange SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC account denominated in foreign currency with the Com- mercial Bank of Syria. The Commercial Bank of Syria may accept prepayments for exports of Syrian products by residents and nonresidents without referring to the Central Bank of Syria. Certain manufactured exports receive subsidies from the Fund for the Development of Exports of Industrial Products. Exports of fru i ts, vegetables, and vegetable oil are subject to an export tax of 8 percent ad valorem. Exports of other agricultural products are subject to an ad valorem agricultural tax of 7 percent. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions by the public sector must be sold at the official market rate, but those from trans- actions by the private sector must be sold at either the tourist market rate or the promotion rate, according to the nature of the transaction. Nonresidents entering the Syrian Arab Republic are permitted to bring in unlimited foreign exchange in any form. Foreign bank notes may be brought in freely by residents and nonresidents. There is no limit on the amount of Syrian bank notes that may be brought into the country by residents and nonresidents. All Syrian nationals employed by Arab, foreign, or inter- national organizations inside the Syrian Arab Republic and paid in fu ll or in part in foreign currencies are required to exchange all such earnings at authorized banks at the tourist exchange rate. With few exceptions, non-Syrian visitors to the Syrian Arab Republic are required to settle their bills at deluxe and first-class hotels with the counterpart of foreign currencies exchanged by them at authorized local banks at the tourist market exchange rate. Upon entering the coun try, all such visitors, other than nationals of Arab countries, are each required to convert a m in imum of US$100 into local currency at the tourist exchange rate. All Syrian Government employees working abroad and covered by the Security and Pension Act and the Social Security Act are required to repatriate and convert at the tourist market rate a m in imum of 25 percent of each year's pay and allowances received in foreign exchange. Capital All inward and outward capital transfers by the public sector take place at the official market rate, while trans- actions by the private sector are determined by the Exchange Office of the Central Bank on a case-by-case basis. Imports of private funds in the form of foreign exchange are free for private individuals, whether resi- dents or nonresidents. The export of capital requires the approval of the Exchange Office, as does most borrowing abroad. Order No. 265 of June 10, 1970 provides special facilities for the investment of funds of immigrants and of nationals of Arab states in the economic development of the Syrian Arab Republic. Incentives for foreign investment in tourism include a seven-year exemption from all taxes and municipal charges; exemption from 465 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC income tax on 50 percent of profits; exemptions from customs duties and other taxes on imports of raw mate- rials, tools, vehicles, and other equipment; permission to import materials needed for repairs up to a value of 3 percent of the previous year's turnover; and authorization to open foreign currency accounts. New incentives were introduced in order to promote foreign investment in agriculture. These include a seven-year exemption from all taxes (including income tax) beginning from the first financial year in which profits are declared, and exemption from import and foreign exchange restrictions. Investment guarantee agreements have been signed with France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland, and the United States. Immovable property in the Syrian Arab Republic may be acquired by nonresidents or foreign nationals other than resident Arab nationals only after presentation of evidence that the foreign exchange equivalent of the price of the property has been converted into Syrian pounds at an authorized local bank. Gold Residents may hold, acquire, and sell manufactured gold in the Syrian Arab Republic without restriction. Domestic transactions in manufactured gold take place at free market prices that are in line with free market prices abroad. Imports of gold are exempt from import licensing, but exports are subject to licensing. Proceeds from exports by residents must be surrendered. Exports of gold previously imported by nonresidents out of their resources abroad are subject to a repatriation commitment covering the cost of manufacturing and the profit earned.

SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC 467 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TANZANIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Tanzania is the Tanzania Shilling, which is pegged to a basket of currencies of Tanzania's main trading partners. The Bank of Tanzania quotes daily buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar. On December 31, 1987 the Bank of Tanzania's buying and selling rates for the shilling in terms of the U.S. dollar were T Sh 83.2985 and T Sh 84.1363, respectively, per US$1. The buying and selling rates for other currencies1 are determined on the basis of the cross rates for these currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar in international markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized dealers, exporting and importing firms, and parastatal organizations may, at their discretion, enter into forward transactions with their customers with re- spect to export and import transactions. Exchange rate risk cover must be with respect to a genuine trade transaction and must conform to the existing export/ import control and exchange control regulations. Forward exchange contracts cannot be undertaken with firms or companies resident outside Tanzania. Cases in which the customer is required to undertake double exchange risk must be referred to the Bank of Tanzania. While entering into forward purchase contracts or extending delivery period of forward purchase contracts already entered into, authorized dealers must ensure that the last date of delivery under the contract or the extended contract (as the case may be) does not fall beyond two months from the expected or actual date of export shipment, and six months from the expected or actual date of import, irrespective of whether the import is covered by a specific import license or an open general license. Any balance left unutilized out of a forward contract after completion of the original transaction must be cancelled. Authorized dealers are encouraged to match their forward purchases with their own forward sales, or vice versa, to the extent possible. They may also cover the mismatched portion of forward purchases or forward sales on international foreign exchange markets. With regard to the residual portion of forward purchase con- tracts relating to exports from Tanzania, authorized deal- ers may approach the Bank of Tanzania for cover. They must not, under any circumstances, keep their forward purchases or sales uncovered. Administration of Control The Minister of Finance has delegated the administra- tion of exchange control to the Bank of Tanzania. In 1 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dol- lars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Indian rupees, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kenya shillings, Malawi kwacha, Mozambique meti- cais, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Pakistan rupees, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Uganda shillings, Zambian kwa- cha, and Zimbabwe dollars. 468 principle, authority for making payments abroad should be delegated by the Bank of Tanzania to the two autho- rized banks —the National Bank of Commerce and the People's Bank of Zanzibar. In practice, virtually all outward payments have to be approved by the Bank of Tanzania; control over exchange operations in Zanzibar is exercised by the People's Bank of Zanzibar. On the mainland, import control is administered by the Imports Controller in the Bank of Tanzania, and export control, by the Exports Controller in the Ministry of Trade. The Bank of Tanzania acts as the registrar of exporters. The responsibility for issuing specific import and export licenses rests with the Controllers, to whom applications must be submitted by the importer or exporter in Tanzania before import orders are placed abroad or exports are shipped. Zanzibar administers an independent system of foreign trade controls through a Board of Trade; all imports and the principal exports are effected by the state-trading agencies (Bizanje and the Zanzibar State Trading Corporation). Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Settlements between residents of Tanzania and non- residents must be made either in convertible currencies or in Tanzania shillings by debit or credit to a Convertible Nonresident Account or Loro Account. Nonresident Accounts Accounts maintained by foreign nationals temporarily resident in Tanzania, firms, companies, or other organi- zations registered or incorporated outside Tanzania, for- eign diplomatic missions, the United Nations or other international organizations, and their officials in Tanzania are designated as nonresident accounts. Accounts main- tained by nonresident Tanzanian nationals and foreign nationals, who were normally resident in Tanzania and have become nonresidents, are also treated as nonresident accounts. Nonresident accounts are broadly divided into two categories: convertible and nonconvertible. Balances on convertible accounts are eligible for transfer from Tan- zania without any further scrutiny of, or approval by, the Bank of Tanzania. Balances on nonconvertible accounts may be transferred from Tanzania after approval is obtained from the Bank of Tanzania. There are six subcategories of nonresident accounts —namely, Exter- nal, Shipping/Airline, Special, Ordinary, Expatriate, and Unspecified. Tanzanian nationals and foreign nationals normally resident in Tanzania who have gone abroad for vacation, employment, or other purposes may maintain both Special and Ordinary Accounts in the form of a current, savings, or deposit account, according to the option of the account holders. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. Some imports into the mainland from any source may be prohibited for reasons of health or security. Certain goods listed in the Import Control Notice of April 8, 1980, known as Open General License, are not being licensed; they may be freely imported, irrespective of coun try of origin; other goods not listed require specific licenses. Under the Own Foreign Exchange Import Scheme, import licenses are issued on request for importation of a specified list of commodities. For va lues not exceeding T Sh 10,000 in each case, imports not financed with official foreign exchange do not require licenses. A semiannual foreign exchange plan provides for in- dicative foreign exchange allocations for goods to be imported subject to specific licenses. Although manufac- turers are permitted to import many goods directly, the importation of specified goods is restricted to centralized import agencies. Unless specifically exempted by the Bank of Tanzania, individual consignments of imports amounting to T Sh 20,000 or above are subject to com- pulsory presh ipment inspection by international agencies for qu an t i ty, qua l i ty, and price. All merchandise imports by the mainland must be insured w i th the National Insurance Corporation of Tanzania, unless exempted by the Bank of Tanzania, and prem iums must be paid in Tanzania shillings. All imports in to Zanzibar are made by Bizanje. Most impor ts, irrespective of their origin, are subject to sales tax at rates ranging up to 50 percent of the c .i .f. value plus import du ty. (This tax is also payable on sales of domestic produc ts .) Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries are controlled and require the approval of the Bank of Tanzania. Non- citizens working in Tanzania under contract in salaried employment and w i th a firm comm i tment to leave Tan- zania eventually may remit abroad, throughout their period of emp loymen t, up to one th ird of their mon th ly salary to cover fam i ly ma in tenance, savings, etc. Appli- cations to remit more than one third of salary, or in excess of T Sh 6,000 a mon th, are considered on their merits by the Bank of Tanzania. The basic exchange allocations for tourist travel are not granted, and fam i ly rem i t tances by residents to relatives abroad are not allowed. A traveler is allowed to take out up to T Sh 100 in domestic currency. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign currency notes, trave ler's checks, and letters of credit for any amount remaining out of the foreign exchange they brought in. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited. On the main- land, exports of products handled by state-trading orga- nizations and exports of certain other products are sub ject to controls and, if there is a local shortage, may be restricted. Exports for sale cannot be effected without an TANZANIA export license. All principal exports of Zanzibar are sold abroad by the Zanzibar State Trading Corporation. Exporters are required to be registered with the Bank of Tanzania and must maintain an account with a local commercial bank. Export proceeds must be repatriated in convertible currencies within two months from the date of exportation. However, on application to the Bank of Tanzania this period may be extended. Export proceeds must be surrendered to an authorized bank upon their collection, with the following exceptions. (1) Exporters of traditional products (six traditional export crops) are entitled to retain up to 10 percent of their export earnings to finance imports of raw materials and capital goods needed for their production activities. (2) Exporters of nontraditional products are entitled to retain 50 percent of their foreign exchange earnings. (3) Exporters involved in a production activity must use all of their retained foreign exchange for imports of raw materials and spare parts essential to their production activities, whereas export traders must use 50 percent of their retained foreign exchange for imports of raw materials and spare parts, and the remainder may be used to import goods on the list that are permitted to be financed by "own foreign exchange" for sale in the local market. Retained earnings may be transferred among export producers and from export traders to export producers through the banking system at the prevailing official exchange rate. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be sold to an authorized bank upon collection. Travelers may freely bring in convertible foreign currency notes; a returning traveler may bring in Tanzania shilling notes and coins exported on departure, up to T Sh 100. Capital Capital transfers to all countries are subject to control by the Bank of Tanzania and are restricted; all capital transfers require individual exchange control approval. Persons leaving Tanzania permanently for settlement abroad will not as a rule be granted foreign exchange facilities. When, however, any person is unable to main- tain himself and his dependents and has no ostensible means of livelihood in Tanzania, limited foreign exchange facilities may be granted by the Bank of Tanzania purely on compassionate grounds. Gifts to nonresidents require the prior approval of the Bank of Tanzania. There is no restriction on the investment of foreign funds in Tanzania, but to ensure eventual repatriation the investment should be recognized by the Bank of Tanzania, and a certificate of its status as an approved enterprise in terms of the Foreign Inves tment (Protection) Act, 1963 should be obtained from the Ministry of Finance. Foreign and domestic investment in specified types of production require approval. All imports and exports of securities require approval. Approval is freely granted for the purchase of Tanzanian securities by nonresidents from residents, provided that payment is received in foreign exchange. The income 469 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TANZANIA from such securities is remittable, as are the proceeds from resale. Purchases of securities outside Tanzania by residents are not permitted.

Not for Redistribution THAILAND (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Thailand is the Thai Bah t. The external value of the baht is de term ined on the basis of the re lat ionsh ip of the baht to a weighted basket of currenc ies of Tha i land's major trading par tners as well as other considerations. The Exchange Equalization Fund an- nounces daily the buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar, the in te rven t ion cu r rency, for transactions be tween itself and commercial bank s; it also announces daily m in imum buy ing and max imum selling rates that com- mercial banks must observe when dealing w i th the public in deutsche mark, Hong Kong dollars, Japanese y en, Malaysian ringgit, pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, and U.S. dollars. On December 30, 1987 the m idd le official rate was B 25.07 = US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Forward exchange markets operate be tween commercial banks and cus- tomers and among the commercial banks. All forward transactions have to be related to unde r ly ing trade trans- actions, and the ma tu r i ty of forward contracts is not perm i t ted to exceed six mon ths. The open foreign ex- change positions of commercial banks are restricted by the Bank of Thailand. The forward p rem ium in the baht/ U .S. dollar rate is free ly de term ined and usua l ly reflects interest d ifferen t ia ls be tween the two currenc ies. Under a Thai baht option sys tem, importers are perm i t ted to acquire the right to purchase U .S. dollars (from a m in imum of $100,000) forward w i th in a six-month period, and by special arrangement, w i th in n ine mon th s. Administration of Control Exchange control is adm in is tered by the Bank of Thailand on behalf of the M in i s t ry of Finance; the Bank delegates respons ib i l i ty for most transactions to au thor- ized banks and authorized persons. All incoming exchange must be sold to an authorized agent. All outgoing pay- men ts are subject to approval (given automatically for bona fide commercial transac t ions and o ther current paymen ts); certain inward capital transfers may also be subject to approval, upon prescription by Ministerial no t if ica t ion .1 Imports of gold require a license issued by the Ministry of Finance. Certain other imports and a few exports are sub ject to licensing by the M in is t ry of Commerce. Prescription of Currency There are no special requ i remen ts concerning the cur- rency to be used for settlements with foreign countries; most paymen ts are made in U .S. dollars. Nonresident Accounts The Bank of Thailand encourages non res iden ts to place foreign currency deposits w i th commercial banks in Thai- 1 No such notification has yet been issued. land. No restrictions are placed on the opening of a foreign currency account as long as the funds originate abroad. Balances on such accounts may be transferred w i thout forma l i ty or restrictions. A commercial bank may pay interest on such deposits at competitive rates. Among baht deposits with commercial banks, there are two types of nonres ident baht accounts: Transferable Accoun ts and Blocked Accoun ts. In principle, transfers of baht to and from nonresident accounts require approval; there are exemptions, however, for nonresident accounts of foreign diplomatic en t i t ies, international organizations based in Thailand, and Thai nationals temporarily abroad. Transferable Accounts may be credited freely with the proceeds from sales to authorized banks of foreign cur- rency transferred from abroad, with amounts transferred from other Transferable Accoun ts, and w i th funds eligible for remittance abroad in foreign currency. Balances on Transferable Accounts are convertible into foreign cur- rency at any time and may be debited freely for the purchase of foreign currencies for transfer abroad, for transfers to other Transferable Accoun ts, for paymen ts in respect of exports, and for any other paymen ts to residents. Funds that are not eligible for credit to a Transferable Account must be credited to Blocked Ac- coun ts. Transfers of baht from Blocked Accounts for the purchase of foreign currency, except for certain current paymen t s, are subject to approval by the Bank of Thai- land; approval is granted when no capital transfer on behalf of a Thai national is invo lved. Imports and Import Payments Most commodities may be imported f ree ly, but import licenses are required for some commodities, and the import of certain other items is prohibited for protective and other reasons. All imports of goods originating in or shipped from South Africa are subject to licensing. Im- ports of tea leaf, tea du s t, skimmed m i lk, soybean meal, and silk yarn are subject to a requ irement that the importer purchase a proportionate quan t i ty of the same type of goods produced in Thailand. Paymen ts for imports may be approved by authorized banks upon submission of documen ts; the specific ap- proval of the Bank of Thailand, which is given for all bona fide transactions, is required for advance paymen ts in excess of US$2,000 and for opening revolving letters of credit or letters of credit w i th an expiry date exceeding nine mon ths. Importers must obtain, in addition to the usual documen ts, a "certificate of paymen t" from an authorized agent before imported goods exceeding B 50,000 in value can be cleared through customs; military equ ipment imported by the Ministry of Defense and certain minor categories of imports are exempt from this requ iremen t. Certain goods are subject to temporary import surcharges. 471 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution THAILAND Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on paymen ts and transfers for current international transactions. Payments for in- visibles require authorization, which is usually given by an authorized bank or otherwise by the Bank of Thailand. Cargo insurance prem iums due to foreign insurers may be remitted in foreign exchange; if they are paid in baht to an agent or a branch office of an insurance company registered abroad, they may be remitted as earned income after taxes. The transfer of profits and d iv idends is permitted freely by the Bank of Thailand. Apart from foreign travel, family maintenance abroad, educational expenses abroad, and import paymen ts, authorized agents are permitted to approve applications for exchange w i th- out supporting documen ts, provided that each payment does not exceed the equivalent of US$140. Authorized money changers are prohibited from selling foreign cur- rency to the general public; their business of transacting foreign means of payment is restricted to the buy ing of foreign currency notes or traveler's checks payable in foreign currencies; all such proceeds must be sold to authorized banks within seven days. For persons traveling abroad for pleasure or personal business trips, authorized agents may approve exchange allowances not exceeding the equivalent of US$1,500 per person (US$2,000 for bus inessmen and government offi- cials) for a trip of not more than 10 days, or the equ iva lent of US$150 a day (US$200 for bus inessmen and govern- ment officials) for a trip of not more than 15 days when a visa is not required and for a trip of not more than 30 days when a visa is required. These allowances are allowed on the condition that foreign currencies are taken out in the form of traveler's checks, foreign bank notes, credit card allowances, and traveling le t ters of credit. For foreign currencies taken out in other forms, such as drafts, a max imum of only US$3,000 is allowed auto- matically; for an amount of more than US$3,000, a formal request must be submitted to the Bank of Thailand. For business or official travel, US$200 a day is allowed, and additional foreign exchange not exceeding US$100 a day may be obtained in certain cases for en ter ta inment ex- penses. Departing Thai residents are subject to a tax at a rate of B 1,000 for a trip by air. For family rem i t tances, authorized banks may sell US$200 a mon th to each transferor for Europe and the Un i ted States and US$150 a month for other countries. Amoun ts above these limits require approval from the Bank of Thailand upon verification. A person may take out local currency not exceeding B 500 (or B 1,000 for a family traveling on one passport), or foreign currency not exceeding US$1,000 for one person (US$2,000 for a family traveling on a single passport) or the equivalent in the form of notes and coins, w i thout the prior approval of the exchange control au- thorities. An amount above this l im i t, but not more than the allowed limit according to the duration of trave l, may be sold in other forms of foreign currencies —e.g., trav- eler's checks. The resale of foreign currency to a person 472 in transit is allowed, provided that the record of foreign currency sold to a commercial bank or authorized agent is shown, and that the purchase is not greater than the amount prev ious ly sold. In add i t ion, foreign tourists may take out foreign bank notes or coins of va lue not exceeding US$10,000. Amoun ts in excess of th is limit may be taken, provided that they have been declared in writing to the customs officer at the time of en t ry. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are subject to licensing. Certain categories of exports are subject to licensing and quan t i ta t ive restrictions, and in a few cases, to prior approval, irrespective of des t ina t ion .2 All other commod- ities may be exported f r e e ly, except to South Africa. Settlement for exports of silver exceeding US$5,000 in value must be made through irrevocable letters of credit. The exporter is requ ired to obtain a "certificate of exportation" from an authorized agent in order to clear the sh ipment through cus toms when the value of exports exceeds B 20,000. Export proceeds must be collected and must be sold to an authorized agent w i th in 7 days of receipt; they must be surrendered w i th in 15 days from the date of export if payment is made by letter of credit, 21 days if a sight bill is drawn for collection, 15 days after the due date of a usance b i l l, or 15 days for o ther methods of paymen t, but in any case not later than 180 days after the date of export. Foreign tou r is ts may freely take out precious stones and gold or p la t inum ornamen ts or other articles up to any va lue. The export of sugar is subject to export lev ies referred to as export p rem ium s. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from inv is ib les mu st be sold to an authorized agent. Au tho r ized persons are allowed to purchase foreign currency notes and coin or t r av e l e r 's checks payable in foreign currenc ies, but the la t ter must be resold to authorized banks. No person may bring in to Thailand local cu r rency exceed ing B 2,000 w i thout a permit (or B 4,000 for a fam i ly t rave l ing on one passport). Travelers may bring in any amount in foreign notes and coin. Capital All ou tward transfers of cap i ta l, inc lud ing p rem iums on life insu rance policies, by res iden ts or non res iden ts are subject to approval. Personal capital exports by res iden ts are restricted. The Bank of Thailand approves the rem i t tance of dona t ions and g if ts of a reasonable amoun t. Foreign exchange from inward capital move- men ts must be sold to an authorized agent and the purpose of the transfer mu st be dec lared.

Not for Redistribution Act B.E. 2520 (issued on April 29, 1977); this treatment includes a guarantee of the transfer abroad of current net earnings and of capital repatriation. The repatriation of other capital is considered on the merits of each case; approval is normally granted if it can be shown that the funds originated abroad. Certain economic activities are reserved for Thai nationals. The contracting of suppliers' credits abroad requires approval by the Bank of Thailand. All other private loans taken up abroad may be registered with the Bank to facilitate approval of outward remittances. The Foreign Debt Committee must approve external borrowing by the public sector. Gold Residents may hold and negotiate domestically gold jewelry, gold coin, and unworked gold. Purchases or sales of gold on commodity fu tu res exchanges are pro- hibited. Imports and exports of gold other than jewelry are subject to the following arrangements, unless they are effected by or on behalf of the monetary authorities: commercial imports of gold are restricted and require a license issued by the Ministry of Finance. Foreign tourists may take out gold ornaments up to any value. Exports of gold bullion are prohibited; traders' exports of gold ornaments exceeding B 5,000 in value require a certificate of exportation for presentation to customs, but they are free of export duty or taxes.

Importers who had already imported the soybean meal with an undertaking to buy local production sub- sequently must enter into a contract with the Foreign Trade Department to buy local soybean meal with a commercial bank posting bond as a guarantee. For the crop year 1986/87, the guaranteed amount was set at B 1.95 per kilogram. Both imports and local purchases had to be completed by October 31. February 6.

Not for Redistribution THAILAND Exports and Export Proceeds February 17. In order to promote border trade, the license fee was reduced from B 20,000 to B 2,000 per license for those exporters residing in border provinces and exporting an amount not exceeding B 20,000 per day. February 27. In compliance with the Government's policy to accelerate the export of the main rice crop in 1986/87, the Bank of Thailand will refinance promissory notes issued by rice exporters who had sold rice to the Ministry of Commerce for such purpose at the rate of 80 percent e f f a ce value. The remaining 20 percent is to be paid in cash by the Ministry of Commerce. The Bank will charge commercial banks 5 percent a year, and commercial banks in turn will charge exporters 7 percent a year. The maturity period is set at 180 days; however, if the Ministry of Commerce fails to export rice within 180 days, new promissory notes may be issued, provided that those due were repaid. These new promissory notes will have the same maturity of 180 days, but can be refi- nanced at only 50 percent of the face value; the additional 30 percent is to be paid in cash by the Ministry of Commerce. Rice prices offered by the Minister of Com- merce in this regard are to be 10 percent higher than the market prices. March 23.

Not for Redistribution TOGO (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Togo is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The Banque Centrale des Etats de 1' Afrique de 1' Quest (BCEAO) levies a commission of 0.10 per mill on transfers from countries outside the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) and one of 2.50 per mill on transfers to such countries.2 Banks levy a commission on transfers to all countries outside the WAMU, part of which must be surrendered to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Contracting of forward exchange cover requires the prior authorization of the Minister of Economy and Finance, and permission may be granted only in respect of impor- tation of certain clearly specified goods. The maturity of exchange contracts must be up to three months for goods deemed essential or strategic and one month for all other goods. There is no official currency swap scheme or guaranteed exchange rate for debt servicing. With the exception of measures relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, Togo's exchange controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Bur- kina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, and Senegal). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which also supervises borrowing abroad, the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Togo, inward direct investment and all outward investment, and the soliciting of funds in Togo for placement in foreign countries. Some of the approval authority in respect of exchange control has been delegated to authorized intermediaries and the BCEAO. The BCEAO is authorized to collect, either directly or through the banks, financial institutions, the Postal and Telecommunications Office (Office des Poste et Telecommunications), and offices of government min- 1 The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Benin, Burk ina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2 Transfers between member countries of the Union are subject to the flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO. istries, any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. Forwarding and receipt of bank notes through the mail by authorized intermediaries are subject to control by the BCEAO. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks, the Postal and Telecommunications Office, or the BCEAO. Import and virtually all export licenses are issued by the Foreign Trade Division in the Ministry of Commerce and Transport, except those for gold, which are granted by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Licenses for the export of cereals and other food crops are issued by the Commission Nationale d'Attribution des Licenses d'Exportation, but within the quota and volume limits set by the Technical Committee for Cereal Exports, after the approval of the Council of Ministers. Prescription of Currency Since Togo is an Operations Account country, settle- ments with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Current payments in relation to The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Maur- itania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally effected through the West African Clearing House. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting to nonresident accounts of CFA bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account is not permitted, except for credits to Foreign Accounts held by foreign correspondents of authorized banks, which may be cred- ited with BCEAO bank notes mailed direct to the BCEAO agency in Lome by those correspondents. Foreign Ac- counts in Francs may also be debited, without authori- zation, with BCEAO bank notes mailed by authorized intermediaries to their foreign correspondents through the BCEAO agency in Lome. Imports and Import Payments All imports of South African origin are prohibited. Imports from countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely, but require the prior authorization of the Foreign Trade Division in the Ministry of Commerce and Transport when valued at CFAF 10,000 or more and are for commercial purposes. Imports from all other countries require individual import licenses when valued at CFAF 10,000 or more. In principle, the licenses are 475 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TOGO granted in accordance with an import program established each year; as yet, however, the program has not been established, and almost all requests for import licenses, irrespective of the origin of the goods, are granted, except as noted below. There is no formal free list. The impor- tation of live or processed broilers is prohibited. The issuance of import licenses for printed piece goods of Japanese origin, footwear other than luxury or sports footwear with an f.o.b. value of less than CFAF 3,000, frozen chickens and chicken offals is conditional, in principle, on the purchase of a specified quantity of the local product; in practice, this requirement is no longer enforced in respect of printed piece goods. The Societe Nationale de Commerce (SONACOM) has an import mo- nopoly for sugar, rice, flour, canned milk, numerous alcoholic beverages, and tobacco and tobacco products. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000, with the exception of imports not involving payment or financed through the Postal Administration and certain imports of a special nature. Import licenses entitle importers to purchase the necessary foreign exchange (spot), but not earlier than eight days before shipment if a documentary credit is opened, or on the due date of payment if the products have already been imported. Purchases of foreign ex- change for down payment are subject to prior authori- zation by the Minister, which may be granted only on the date such payment is due and only for up to 30 percent of each transaction involving capital goods and 10 percent for other transactions. All import operations exceeding CFAF 200,000 are conditional on merchandise insurance being taken out and domiciled with an approved insurance company in Togo. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are per- mitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted by a general authorization when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require au- thorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also generally permitted. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Oper- ations Account countries may obtain an exchange allo- cation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a person a trip (CFAF 87,500 for children under 10 years) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange in excess of CFAF 5,000 remaining after return to Togo must be surrendered within eight days of re-entry. For business travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 400,000 a trip. The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreign national working in Togo is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, residence permit, or work 476 permit, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Residents may at any time and without indicating the purpose of the transfer make payments abroad, through an authorized bank, up to CFAF 50,000 a transfer. Resident and nonresident trav- elers to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other countries of the French Franc Area. Resident travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes, but if proceeding to a country that is not a member of the WAMU, they must declare to customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 250,000. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign bank notes and coin up to the amount declared by them on entry3 or, if no declaration has been made, up to the equivalent of CFAF 175,000. Nonresident travelers may also freely take out any amount of letters of credit and traveler's checks drawn in their names abroad. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to all countries require licenses. All exports to South Africa are prohibited. The Office Togolais des Phosphates (OTP) has a monopoly over the export of phosphates, and the Office des Produits Agricoles du Togo (OPAT) has a monopoly over the export of cocoa, coffee, cotton, groundnuts, and certain other agricultural commodities. Exports of cereals are permitted, but licen- ses are generally granted only in years when the Technical Committee for Cereal Exports determines that there is a food grain surplus. The Technical Committee meets twice a year —at the beginning of March to make forecasts of the exportable surplus, and in early November (by No- vember 10) to establish the actual export ceilings. The due date for payment for exports to foreign countries, including the French Franc Area, may not be later than 180 days after the arrival of the goods at their destination, and the proceeds must be surrendered within a month after the due date; authorized diamond purchasing offices, however, may retain foreign currency proceeds in foreign currency accounts with authorized banks in Togo. All export transactions relating to foreign countries, including the French Franc Area, must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000 and the domiciling bank is responsible for ensuring effec- tive repatriation of such receipts through BCEAO. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles transactions with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income 3 This amount is adjusted for (1) the amount of foreign currency sold for CFA francs, and (2) any foreign currency acquired in Togo by (a) debit to a Foreign Account in Francs or a Foreign Account in Foreign Currency, (b) the conversion of foreign currency traveler's checks, etc., made out in the name of the traveler, and (c) any repurchases of foreign currency (permitted up to CFAF 175,000) with CFA francs resulting from the sale of foreign currency. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected and surrendered within one month of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any institute of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Residents bringing in foreign bank notes and foreign currency traveler's checks in excess of CFAF 5,000 must sell them to an authorized bank within eight days. Capital Capital movements between Togo and France (as de- fined above), Monaco, and the other countries of the French Franc Area are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval by the Minister of Economy and Finance and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward investment, over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Togo, and over the soliciting of funds in Togo for placement abroad. Such operations require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Exempt from authorization, how- ever, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Togolese Governmen t, and (2) shares that are identical with, or may be substituted for, securities whose issuing, advertising, or offering for sale in Togo has already been authorized. With the exception of controls relating to foreign securities and the soliciting of funds in Togo, these measures do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, member coun- tries of the WAMU, and the Operations Account coun- tries. There also are special controls applicable to all countries other than Togo with respect to imports and exports of gold. All investments abroad by residents of Togo require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance;4 beginning June 24, 1981 at least 75 percent of such investments must be financed by foreign borrowing. Foreign direct investments in Togo5 must be declared to the Minister of Economy and Finance before they are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request postponement of the projects. The total or partial liqui- dation of any inward direct investment or any outward investment also requires prior declaration to the Minister of Economy and Finance. Both the making and the 4 Including inves tmen ts made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Togo and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Togo. 5 Including those made by companies in Togo that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Togo of foreign companies. TOGO liquidation of investments, whether these are Togolese investments abroad or foreign investments in Togo, must be reported to the Minister of Economy and Finance and to the BCEAO within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments constitute investments implying con- trol of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) loans contracted by authorized banks; (3) loans taken up either by industrial firms to finance operations abroad or by approved international merchanting houses to fi- nance imports or exports; and (4) in certain circumstances, any other loans, provided that the outstanding amount for any one borrower does not exceed CFAF 100 million. The repayment of any foreign borrowing requires the prior authorization of the Minister of Economy and Finance; exempt from this requirement are loans consti- tuting a direct inves tmen t, loans taken up by authorized banks, and any loans exempted by the Minister. Lending abroad is subject only to special authorization by the Directorate of Economy. Under the provisions of the general tax legislation, certain fiscal benefits are accorded to specified new investment (foreign and domestic) in both new and existing enterprises. In addition, certain enterprises, in accordance with their importance to the economic development of Togo, may be granted special privileges for a specified number of years relating to the maintenance of existing taxes and exemption from import duties. Such privileges are negotiated by the Government and the investor. The Investment Law, applicable to both foreign and domestic capital, sets out the types of enterprises that may be designated as "priority enterprises," provided that the head office is in Togo. Such firms may sign a special founding agreement by which they receive certain tax benefits. Firms that undertake to invest at least CFAF 3 billion may receive a guarantee in respect of their taxation over a number of years. The law guarantees the right of free transfer abroad of capital invested in Togo and of all investment income therefrom. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Togo. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. 477 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TOGO Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments January 1. The monopoly of SONACOM on imports of selected alcoholic beverages was abolished. 478 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TONGA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Tonga is the Pa'anga (commonly referred to as the Tonga pa'anga), which has been pegged at par to the Australian dollar since November 1976. Tonga has no central bank, and the authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange. As a transitional arrange- men t, the Bank of Tonga quotes daily rates for 15 other currencies1 on the basis of their respective values against the Australian dollar, the in terven t ion currency. The spread between the Bank of Tonga's buying and selling rates is approximately 2 percent. Sales of foreign exchange are at a prem ium of approximately 1.5 percent, and purchases are at a discount of approximately 0.5 percent. However, for export receipts, the Bank buys foreign exchange at the midpoint rate, upon submission of doc- umentary evidence that the foreign exchange is derived from export sales. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On December 31, 1987 the buy ing and selling rates of the pa'anga for the U.S. dollar were T$0.711 and T$0.726, respectively, per US$1. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk operating in the official or the com- mercial banking sector. However, the Bank of Tonga, on request, arranges forward cover for Australian dollars against a third currency (but not Australian dollars against pa'anga) in respect of export proceeds. Administration of Control Tonga's trade and payments system is relatively free of controls. Foreign exchange transactions are regulated by the Bank of Tonga and the Ministry of Finance. Exchange regulations require the timely surrender of export proceeds to the Bank of Tonga, but this is not rigidly enforced. Prescription of Currency There are no regulations prescribing the currencies to be used in particular transactions. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are required only for motor vehicles, and import quotas are applied only to fresh eggs. The 1 Canadian dollars, deutsche ma rk, Fiji dollars, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Indian rupees, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, New Zealand dollars, pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. importation of certain items is restricted for cultural, health, safety, or environmental reasons. Tariffs, which apply to most private sector imports, are primarily for revenue purposes, and protective tariffs are levied on a few items, such as paint and wire fencing. Payments for Invisibles Tonga's system of exchange controls provides for specified limits on sales of foreign exchange for travel, education, and health purposes; such limits may be exceeded with the approval of the Ministry of Finance. The Bank of Tonga has discretionary authority to approve foreign exchange sales for travel expenses up to T$ 1,000 in any 12 months on submission of valid sea or air tickets. Shipping and airline agencies may remit fares and freight earned in Tonga on production of copies of returns forwarded to their respective head offices. Payment for education and health purposes may be approved on submission of evidence of the intended use of foreign exchange, and there is no fixed limit for such foreign exchange sales. Exports and Export Proceeds Export proceeds must be surrendered to the Bank of Tonga within 90 days of shipment, but these regulations are not rigidly enforced. There are no taxes or quantitative restrictions on exports, but coconut derivatives and ba- nanas may be exported commercially only through the Tonga Commodities Board. The Tonga Commodities Board must authorize the export of whole coconuts. Capital The authorities maintain a liberal attitude toward foreign direct investment, which so far remains small. Foreign investors are required to apply for a license, with approval depending on the type of investment. Investors are permitted a wide range of activities, but activities that complement domestic production, rather than competing with it, are generally preferred. Under the Industrial Development Incentives Act, foreign investors involved in manufacturing are allowed duty-free imports of capital inputs, a five-year tax holiday, and repatriation of profits and capital. Acquisition of financial assets abroad by Tongan resi- dents is, in principle, not permitted. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 479 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Trinidad and Tobago is the Trinidad and Tobago Dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at TT$3.60 = US$1. The official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar are TT$3.59550 and TT$3.63150, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are also officially quoted, with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. There is a limited forward exchange market, in which the Central Bank quotes forward selling rates for the major international currencies.2 The rates quoted to the commercial banks are for local trading, on a fixed fu ture date, for one-, two-, or three-month periods. Administration of Control The authority to administer exchange control is vested in the Central Bank, acting under delegated authoritity of the Ministry of Finance. The exchange control system provides for compulsory surrender of foreign currency3 4 and for control over both current and capital transactions. All overseas payments and transfers require the approval of the exchange control authorities; payments to South Africa are prohibited. The Central Bank exercises direct control on imports of visible items. Persons wishing to import such items must apply to the Central Bank, which will authorize in advance the amount of foreign exchange that will be made available for the importation of the specified item. Approval authority with respect to pay- ment for visible imports has been delegated to the Ministry responsible for trade (Ministry of Indus try, Enterprise, and Tourism). This Ministry also issues import and export licenses, if required. Short-term credit transactions, such as the granting of credit, loan, or overdraft facilities by resident banks to nonresidents and local non-resident- controlled companies, are also subject to control. Foreign currency is not legal tender in Trinidad and Tobago. Commercial banks can purchase foreign currency notes from the public. The Central Bank in turn buys certain of these currencies from the commercial banks for repatriation to the respective monetary authorities under bilateral arrangements. The Central Bank of Trin- idad and Tobago does not repatriate Trinidad and Tobago currency. 1 Barbados dollars, Belize dollars, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, Eastern Caribbean dollars, French francs, Guyana dollars, Jamaica dollars, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs. 2 Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, Neth- erlands guilders, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs. 3 Under Trinidad and Tobago's exchange control regulations, all cur- rencies other than the Trinidad and Tobago dollar are considered foreign currencies. 4 If the business of a trader, firm, or company involves f requent receipts and paymen ts in foreign currencies, permission may be granted for the retention of a portion of the receipts in a Foreign Currency Accoun t, subject to the requirement, inter alia, that periodic statements of credits and debits to the account be submitted to the authorities. 480 Prescription of Currency Settlements may be made in U.S. dollars or in any other specified currency,5 except South African currency. Authorized payments, including paymen ts for imports, to all countries may be made in U.S. dollars or in any other specified currency. Payments from all countries with which trade is allowed must be received in U.S. dollars or in any other specified currency. Nonresident Accounts There are two types of nonresident accounts: External Accounts and Blocked Accounts. External Accounts may be opened by commercial banks for nonresidents of Trinidad and Tobago. These accounts may be credited with payments by residents of Trinidad and Tobago that have been approved by the exchange control authorities, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with proceeds from the sale of gold and foreign currencies to an authorized dealer. They may be debited for payments to residents of Trinidad and Tobago, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for pur- chases of foreign currencies. The funds in these accounts are treated as equivalent to External Accounts in U.S. dollars or any other foreign currency and may be trans- ferred freely between residents of countries outside Trin- idad and Tobago, with the exception that transfers from External Accounts held by residents of the Caribbean Common Market (CARicoM)6 countries to any country outside Trinidad and Tobago other than that of the holder's residence are conditional on the Central Bank being satisfied that the exchange control authorities of the holder's country of residence do not object. Blocked Accounts are normally credited with the bal- ance of capital assets of persons who have emigrated from Trinidad and Tobago. The use of balances on Blocked Accounts is subject to authorization. Blocked funds may be reinvested in local securities with the permission of the exchange control authorities. Income arising from Blocked Accounts (such as interest and rents) is freely remittable, provided the tax liabilities are settled. Generally, funds held in Blocked Accounts are eligible for remittance to nonresidents on an annual basis. Imports and Import Payments Annual foreign exchange sales for imports are guided by a foreign exchange budget for imports. Ceilings are established on the amount of foreign exchange to be 5 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Burmese kya ts, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and pounds sterling. 6 The CARICOM countries are Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. K i t ts and Nev is, St. Lucia, St. V incent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution allocated annually for specific imports. Within these ceilings, limits are applied to the amounts allocated to individual applicants.7 The allocation criteria give priority to capital goods, raw materials, other industrial inputs, and essential food and drugs. All importers must have a foreign exchange allocation from the Central Bank or the importation must otherwise be approved by the Central Bank. While most commodities may be imported under open general license arrangements, some imports are subject to the provisions of a Negative List. The list cites over 200 items that are subject to regulation by specific license and also identifies countries that are accorded special treatment. Procedures for licensing imports from CARI- COM countries were liberalized on September 1, 1986, and the administrative guidelines for foreign exchange allocation in 1987 provided for procedures which accel- erated and assured exchange allocations for imports from CARICOM suppliers. The main items that are subject to the Negative List include some food items, cement, clothing, corrugated iron sheeting, cosmetics, coffee and cocoa beans, and completely assembled motor vehicles. Firearms, ammu- nition, and narcotics are either prohibited or rigidly controlled for security and health reasons. Certain food products are covered by the Agricultural Marketing Pro- tocol of the CARICOM Treaty. Imports of rice, oil, and fats are subject to state trading. All imports of food and drugs must satisfy prescribed standards. Imports of meat, live animals, and plants are subject to specific regulation, as are imports of mining materials. All other commodities from all sources may be imported under open general license. General import licenses for importing certain inputs for the manufacturing industry are issued in conjunction with duty-free licenses granted to local concessionaire manufacturers. For these inputs, a specific license is no longer required for shipments of items in the Negative List, or for items that originate or are consigned from sources from which all goods are subject to import license. When specific import licenses are required, they must be obtained from the ministry responsible for trade (Ministry of Indus try, Enterprise, and Tourism) before orders are placed. Payments for all imports require exchange control approval. Trade with South Africa is prohibited, and all imports from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and Yugoslavia are subject to specific licensing, irrespective of the Negative List status of .the import concerned. At present, trade with these countries may be settled in U.S. dollars. Imports from all other countries may be paid for in any currency in which the goods are satisfactorily invoiced. TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO Imports other than basic food items, drugs, books, news- print, and raw materials are subject to stamp duties at the rate of 12 percent or 6 percent of the c.i.f. value.8 Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles require the specific approval of the authorities. Applications for foreign ex- change must be supported by appropriate documentary evidence. No restrictions are imposed on payments for current international transactions, except with respect to South Africa. Under authority delegated by the Central Bank, the authorized banks may approve applications for foreign exchange within prescribed limits for certain transactions in invisibles. If additional amounts are needed, the specific approval of the authorities is required. For outward remittances of gifts and donations, individuals must obtain approval from the Central Bank. The basic allowance a person for tourist travel is the equivalent of TT$2,500 a year; for business travel, TT$350 a day for a maximum of 30 days for one trip (for a one-day trip, TT$730); and for health care, TT$12,000 a year. Allow- ances for education abroad are the equivalent of TT$8,000 for secondary schools, TT$12,000 for universities, and TT$1,200 for correspondence courses, and TT$700 once every two years for warm clothing. Residents and nonresidents may take out of Trinidad and Tobago notes up to the equivalent of TT$200. Trav- elers who are regarded as residents of Trinidad and Tobago may obtain part of their basic travel allowance in foreign currency notes up to a maximum of TT$ 1,200. Nonresi- dents visiting Trinidad and Tobago may, on departure, take out foreign currency notes up to the amount brought in by them. Nonresidents leaving Trinidad and Tobago are allowed to reconvert Trinidad and Tobago dollar notes into foreign currency up to the equivalent of TT$ 1,200, upon showing evidence of having previously sold foreign currency to authorized dealers. Sums in excess of TT$ 1,200 require the approval of the Central Bank. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of certain goods usually require an individual license. These include some foodstuffs, arms and explo- sives, animals, gold, and petroleum and petroleum prod- ucts produced in Trinidad and Tobago, as well as specified products not produced locally. Exports of all other com- modities are permitted by an open general license. In addition, general licenses may be issued at the discretion of the ministry responsible for trade (Ministry of Industry, Enterprise, and Tourism). Exporters to Guyana are ad- vised to ensure that the Guyanese importers are in possession of appropriate approval documents issued by the Central Bank of Guyana attesting to the availability of foreign exchange to make the necessary settlements. 7 Effec t ive January 2, 1988, a new system of foreign exchange allocation was put in place. Under this system, trade allocation certificates containing an approved amount in local currency are issued to importers registered at the Central Bank. These certificates are used toward the purchase of foreign exchange for imports during the year. 8 Effective January 2, 1988, the stamp duty on capital goods, plant machinery, and equipment was increased from 6 percent to 10 percent; the stamp duty on all other goods (with the exception of basic food items, drugs, books, newsprint, and raw materials) was raised from 12 percent to 20 percent. 481 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO Export proceeds received in foreign currencies must be surrendered, but exporters of certain goods, notably petroleum, may be authorized to retain abroad a portion of their proceeds. In practice, the foreign-owned petro- leum companies operating in Trinidad and Tobago repa- triate all foreign exchange after providing for the equiv- alent of their local currency needs. These companies must submit periodic documents of their exchange trans- actions to the authorities. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from current invisibles received in foreign currencies must be surrendered. Residents and nonresi- dents may bring into Trinidad and Tobago currency notes up to the value of TT$200. Foreign currency notes may be brought in by both resident and nonresident travelers. Capital Capital transfers from Trinidad and Tobago require approval and generally are restricted. However, repay- ment of commercial credits is permitted freely, and gifts to nonresidents and emigration allowances are approved up to specified limits; furthermore, as a matter of policy, capital transfers to other CARICOM countries are facili- tated. Legacies may be expatriated in full. However, the Central Bank reserves the right to phase remittances up to a maximum of four years. Certain international insti- tutions may be permitted to borrow in Trinidad and Tobago on a case-by-case basis. Securities expressed in Trinidad and Tobago dollars and held by nonresidents must be lodged with an author- ized depository, 23 of which have been appointed. Re- strictions are placed on the import and export of all securities other than securities expressed in Trinidad and Tobago dollars. Proceeds from the sale of securities or other investments owned by nonresidents of Trinidad and Tobago may not ordinarily be transferred and are eligible for credit only to a Blocked Account (see section on Nonresident Ac- counts, above); however, approval is often given to residents to purchase such assets. All foreign investment, whether in cash or in kind, is normally eligible for repatriation, provided it has been registered with the Central Bank. Hence, when funds are received for in- vestment, local banks should authenticate the receipt of such funds from External Accounts. In the event of an appreciation in the value of the asset concerned, the remittance of any funds in excess of the original invest- ment will normally be phased over a period of time, depending on the balance of payments situation. Residents may transfer prescribed securities to persons resident outside Trinidad and Tobago, with the prior approval of the exchange control authorities, provided that the full proceeds of sale are received in foreign currency. Foreign exchange is not normally provided for portfolio investment by residents in foreign securities, but when securities are sold or redeemed in a market 482 outside Trinidad and Tobago, the proceeds may either be brought in and sold to an authorized dealer at the official market rate of exchange or, with the prior approval of the exchange control authorities, be invested outside Trinidad and Tobago in similar securities. Nonresidents may sell local securities, provided that the proceeds are credited to a Blocked Account or are reinvested in other local securities. The laws of Trinidad and Tobago do not discriminate between nationals and foreigners in the formation and operation of companies in that country. Foreigners are required, however, to obtain a license under the Aliens (Landholding) Ordinance in order to hold an interest in real estate or to hold shares in local companies. Prospec- tive foreign investors must obtain approval for their project from the authorities in Trinidad and Tobago in order to be able to repatriate capital and capital gains. The Government has enacted basic incentive legislation designed to attract domestic and foreign investment in manufacturing and in import-substitution industries. Since 1973 these policies have been effected within the frame- work of a CARICOM agreement on harmonization of fiscal incentives. Certain concessions may be granted to enter- prises declared to be approved enterprises. Concessions include temporary relief from import duties and taxes and other privileges. These are outlined in the Investment Policy document issued by the Industrial Development Corporation. There are limitations on the extent to which banks may grant finance to nonresident individuals and firms and to non-resident-controlled local companies. Such companies are normally required to raise any local capital needed to supplement their assets by issuing either shares or bonds to residents of Trinidad and Tobago. Each commercial bank must maintain the monthly average of its net foreign exchange position within a specified quantitative ceiling. A commercial bank, as an authorized dealer, is allowed to hold an "open" asset or liability position in foreign exchange. However, the monthly average of its net foreign exchange position must be maintained within specified quantitative ceilings. Gold Gold is defined by the Exchange Control Act of 1970 as gold coin and bullion. The regulations provide tha t, except with specific exemptions and permissions granted by the Minister of Finance: (1) one party to every transaction in gold between residents must be an author- ized bank; (2) gold held by residents must be surrendered to an authorized bank; and (3) gold may not be taken or sent out of Trinidad and Tobago. Residents are permitted in appropriate cases, however, to purchase, hold, or sell gold coins in Trinidad and Tobago for numismatic purposes. Control on the import and export of gold is administered by the ministry responsible for trade (Ministry of Indus try, Enterprise, and Tourism). Imports of gold jewelry are on open general license, but imports of gold other than ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO jewelry are subject to specific import licenses issued by the Ministry of Industry, Enterprise, and Tourism; such licenses are not normally issued except to the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users. Exports of gold, whether jewelry or otherwise, are subject to specific export licenses issued by the Ministry of Indus try, En- terprise, and Tourism; such licenses for gold other than jewelry are not normally granted except to the monetary authorities. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 23. The exchange rate system was unified at the rate of TT$3.60 per US$1. Imports and Import Payments January 23. The 12 percent stamp duty on imports of books and newsprint was abolished. 483 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TUNISIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Tunisia is the Tunisian Dinar. The exchange value of the dinar is determined in accordance with a basket of currencies. The buying and selling rates for foreign currencies1 are fixed daily by the Central Bank of Tunisia. On December 31, 1987 the spot buying and selling rates of the dinar were D 0.14380 and D 0.14524, respectively, per F 1, and D 0.7740 and D 0.7817, respectively, per US$1. The buying and selling rates of authorized banks are identical with those of the Central Bank. Forward rates are published daily by the Central Bank. For both cash and loan transactions, importers and exporters are permitted to obtain forward exchange cover before customs duties are levied. The forward rates are calculated for periods of one to eight months for the selling rates and for periods of up to six months for the buying rates. Selling rates for up to 12 mon ths are quoted for hoteliers for services provided to nonresidents. Travel agencies are also allowed to obtain forward exchange cover for their hotel activities. Currencies quoted forward are Belgian francs, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, and U.S. dollars. Exchange rate guarantees, funded by an exchange guarantee fund established by the Government, are pro- vided for service payments on external debt contracted by Tunisian enterprises, for which the Government has undertaken to cover the exchange risk. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank; some authority over payments for imports and invisibles is delegated to the authorized banks. Foreign trade control is administered by the Commerce Directorate of the Ministry of National Economy, which determines, in consultation with the Central Bank, the Industry Direc- torate, and other concerned ministries, the imports and exports that are to be restricted or liberalized as well as the imports that are to be subject to quotas in accordance with the Government's overall program and the trade agreements with foreign countries. The Ministry of Na- tional Economy and the Central Bank issue import and export licenses.

Settlements between Tunisia and Morocco and certain settlements between Tunisia and Algeria may be effected through accounts in the national currencies concerned at the central banks. Pay- ments to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Resident and Nonresident Accounts Special Accounts in Foreign Currency or Convertible Dinars may be opened by (1) physical persons of Tunisian nationality changing their normal residence to Tunisia from abroad, physical or juridical persons of Tunisian nationality entitled to the exchange amnesty provided under Law No. 86/83 of September 1, 1986, and any other physical or juridical persons of Tunisian nationality for their assets legitimately acquired abroad; (2) physical persons of foreign nationality residing in Tunisia; and (3) foreign juridical persons for their establishment located in Tunisia. No formalities are required for the opening of these accounts by foreigners; a declaration of holdings, however, is required for Tunisians. Funds legitimately acquired abroad, not from the export of goods or services from Tunisia, may be credited to these accounts. Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars and Convert- ible Currencies may be opened freely by all nonresidents regardless of nationality. (Residents are also authorized to open similar accounts under special regulations.) These accounts may be credited freely with (1) foreign bank notes or dinar proceeds from sales to the Central Bank of convertible currencies, including bank notes declared to the customs; (2) convertible foreign currencies remitted to the account holder by a nonresident; (3) foreign currency purchased from the Central Bank by debit of a Foreign Account in Convertible Dinars; (4) authorized payments by residents in favor of the account holder; (5) interest on balances in these accounts and interest payable by the authorized intermediaries on foreign exchange deposits in the accounts whenever they can use the funds thus deposited at remunerative rates; (6) transfers from other Foreign Accoun ts; and (7) the proceeds from the cashing of checks, traveler's checks, or drafts expressed in convertible currencies and made out by a nonresident to the order of the account holder. All other crediting requires prior authorization of the Central Bank, either direct or by delegation. These accounts may be debited freely for (1) paymen ts of any kind in Tunisia (irrespective of the country of residence of the payer); (2) transfers to other Foreign Accounts; (3) the purchase of any foreign currency from or sales of any foreign exchange to the Central Bank; and (4) transfers abroad or delivery of foreign currency to the account holder, to any other nonresident beneficiary, or to residents with the status of permanent representatives or salaried employees of the account holder. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Internal Nonresident Accounts are used by persons of foreign nationality staying temporarily in Tunisia and receiving income in dinars; these accounts may be opened freely, but balances may be used only in Tunisia. These accounts may be credited with the nontransferable portion (usually 50 percent) of the income earned in Tunisia. Any residual balance may not be transferred abroad without authorization. Interest is paid at rates comparable to those applied to resident accounts in dinars. Internal Nonresident Export Accounts may be credited with the nontransferable portion (usually 50 percent) of the salaries of nonresident foreign nationals employed in industrial enterprises exporting all of their output gov- erned by Title 2 of Law No. 87-51 of August 2, 1987. Special Dinar Accounts. Nonresident foreign enter- prises holding contracts in Tunisia are authorized freely to open, for each contract, a single special account in dinars for deposit of the portion of the contract price payable in dinars to cover their local expenses. Such accounts may also be credited with funds from a Foreign Account in Convertible Dinars, the dinar equivalent of foreign currency drawn on a Foreign Account in Con- vertible Foreign Currency, the dinar equivalent of any transfer in convertible foreign currency from abroad, and interest accruing on funds deposited in the account. The account may be freely debited for the enterprise's contract-related expenses in Tunisia. Any transfer operations from such accounts must be authorized by the Central Bank of Tunisia. Interest is paid at rates comparable to those applied to resident accounts in dinars. Suspense Accounts may be opened by all residents regardless of nationality. They may be used for crediting all proceeds accruing to nonresidents and awaiting utili- zation. These proceeds may, upon general or specific approval, be used in Tunisia for specific purposes to be transferred abroad or transferred to other nonresident accounts. Subject to certain conditions, Suspense Ac- counts may be debited, without the prior authorization of the Central Bank, in respect of purchases of Tunisian securities, subscriptions to issues of short-term deben- tures or bonds, portfolio management expenses in respect of certain securities, paymen ts to the Tunisian Govern- ment or public institutions, or payments of the expenses of managing securities deposited in a suspense file opened in the name of the account holder, and settlement of living expenses incurred in Tunisia by the account holder or his family up to D 100 a person a week, provided that the total withdrawals in any calendar year from one or more accounts do not exceed D 2,000 a family. In addition, a Suspense Account holder traveling in Tunisia between November 1 and March 31 may withdraw from such an account an amount equal to the foreign exchange imported for the trip and surrendered to the Central Bank of Tunisia, an authorized intermediary, or a subagency, provided that total withdrawals for the living expenses of the account holder or his family do not exceed D 2,000 a year. Physical persons of foreign nationality may transfer abroad assets that they hold if these did not exceed TUNISIA D 1,000 on December 31, 1973 or D 2,000 on May 31, 1975. Up to D 50 per year may be debited to assist the offspring or parents of the resident account holder. Physical or juridical persons of French or Italian nation- ality holding Suspense Accounts may transfer the balances belonging to them in each such account as of June 30, 1986 and August 31, 1986, respectively. These accounts do not pay interest. Capital Accounts may be opened in the name of a resident of any foreign country. The opening of a Capital Account by a nonresident of Tunisian nationality or his spouse must be authorized by the Central Bank. Foreign banks may hold global Capital Accounts for their non- resident customers. Subject to certain conditions, Capital Accounts may be credited, without prior approval of the Central Bank, with the proceeds of the sale on the stock exchange, or of the contractual or advance redemption, of Tunisian securities, the sales proceeds of real estate or rights to real estate situated in Tunisia, and with funds from another Capital Account. Irrespective of the account holder's country of residence, Capital Accounts may be freely debited for living expenses in Tunisia of the account holder and his family, up to D 100 a person a week, provided that total withdrawals from one or more Capital Accounts in a calendar year do not exceed D 2,000 a family. In addition, a Capital Account holder traveling in Tunisia between November 1 and March 31 may withdraw from such an account an amount equal to the foreign exchange imported for the trip and surrendered to the Central Bank of Tunisia, an authorized intermediary, or a subagency, provided that total withdrawals for the living expenses of the account holder or his family do not exceed D 2,000 a year. Such accounts may also be debited, subject to certain conditions, for expenses connected with the management of Tunisian securities, the maintenance, repair, and insurance of real estate and all taxes, and for transfer to the credit of another Capital Account. Balances on capital accounts are freely transferable between non- residents of foreign nationality, with the exception of juridical persons governed by public law. Subject to certain conditions, they may also be debited to assist the account holder's parents and offspring residing in Tunisia at a maximum rate of D 50 a person a month. These accounts do not pay interest and cannot be overdrawn. Balances held by physical persons of foreign nationality and not exceeding D 1,000 on December 31, 1973 or D 2,000 on May 31, 1975 are transferable abroad. Physical and juridical persons of French or Italian nationality holding Capital Accounts may transfer the balances be- longing to them in each such account as of June 30, 1986 and August 31, 1986, respectively. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. A system of import controls is applied under which there are different procedures for different operators (manu- facturers, traders, and state monopolies) and special procedures for specified categories of transactions (e.g., 485 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TUNISIA export firms, and imports without payment from official foreign exchange). Imports may be effected freely, subject to quota, or prohibited. The relevant regime is prescribed by Annex I of the Notice to Importers and Exporters, published in the Official Gazette No. 75 of November 27, 1981, as amended subsequently. Importation of liberalized prod- ucts does not require prior authorization and is effected by an import certificate, obtained upon presentation of a commercial contract, domiciled with an authorized inter- mediary. The import certificate procedure may be used under certain conditions by industrial enterprises that export 15 percent or more of their output for imports of prohibited products. These include raw materials and semifinished products used in their production; enter- prises exporting less than 15 percent of their output may also use this procedure for imports not exceeding the value of their exports. The import certificate procedure may also be used by investment promoters authorized to import normally prohibited capital goods that are required for their projects, provided they are indicated in the authorization certificate, by commercial representatives in Tunisia of the suppliers of these goods, and by leasing companies. Importation of products prohibited or subject to quota requires an annual import authorization, an import license, or an import card issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and endorsed by the Central Bank of Tunisia. An "annual import authorization" is available to indus- trialists and agencies responsible for providing the country with certain staples or industrial products; approvals are not transferable between enterprises. Each industrialist must submit a detailed document, giving information not only on expected import requirements for the following year and the actual consumption of imported or domes- tically produced inputs in the previous year, but also on sales, production, employment, import prices, and the firm's financial position. Annual import authorizations are given for a global limit, expressed in dinars; they are valid for one year with an automatic extension of the portion unused on December 31 of that year for an additional one-year period. Importers may make changes among the products specified in their import authoriza- tions, provided that such a change does not reduce their planned purchase of domestically produced inputs. Import licenses are valid for six months. In some cases this period may be reduced or extended by the competent authorities in accordance with import requirements. A subsection of the licensing system is in the form of 4' traders' quotas," applicable to some 35 commodity groups, with special emphasis on consumer durables. Quotas are allocated on a "points system," with the most important criteria relating to firm size (employment and turnover, the latter differentiating between sales from imports and those from domestically produced goods). Geographical location, the degree of specialization, and the age of the firm, are also considered in the allocation process. 486 Certain imports of raw materials, semifinished products, spare parts, and equipment, paid from sources outside Tunisia, may be effected by enterprises for their own use up to a value of D 20,000. To meet urgent needs for their exclusive use, importers in particular sectors of economic activity (mainly, cottage craft industry and agriculture) may obtain "importer's cards" to cover goods up to a limit of D 500 a year for each importer. State-trading organizations are the exclusive importers of about one fourth of the total value of imports, some 50 percent of which are in the form of energy products. Among the important public-trading agencies are the Commerce Office (for sugar, coffee, tea), the Office des Cereales (grains), Ellouhoum (meat), and the Office Na- tional de 1'Huile (vegetable oil). In addition, certain food items, beverages, tobacco, and medical products are imported exclusively by other state agencies. The state- trading commissions meet periodically to decide on the appropriateness and timing of imports of specified prod- ucts. For items that are not on the free list, state-trading agencies are required to complete the same licensing formalities as those applicable to the private sector. Manufacturing industries producing exclusively for ex- port and covered by Title 2 of Law No. 87-51 may import freely any goods required for their production process, subject only to customs declaration. In specified cases, imports destined for domestic investment projects are eligible for full or partial exemption from import du ty. Importers must receive a customs code number as a prior condition for obtaining an import certificate, an import authorization, an import license, or an importer's card. All import documents involving payments must be handled by an authorized bank. Foreign currency may be purchased from the Central Bank or a delegated commercial bank for all payments that have received general or specific prior authorization. Resident importers are authorized to buy forward foreign currencies required for fu tu re settlement of their merchandise imports, for a maximum term of eight months, at rates established daily by the Central Bank. In addition to customs duties, a number of import taxes are applied. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require the approval of the Central Bank; for some transactions this authority has been delegated to the authorized intermediaries. Payments for a number of current invisibles are freely approved, provided that they are properly documented. These include (1) various payments related to international trade (e.g., port services, warehousing, commissions, and brokerage); (2) payments for processing, repair, assembly, royalties, patents and trademarks, taxes, fines, and court expenses; and (3) payment of interest and amortization arising from authorized contractual obligations to non- residents. Approval is also given freely for remittance of dividends due to nonresidents. In addition, exporters holding balances on EFAC ac- counts (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, below) may use these up to fixed limits for expenditures ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution abroad in connection with participation in international trade fairs, and to pay customs duties and various other expenses related to exports. Exporters, hotel owners, travel agencies, and other external service industries may use EFAC balances freely for expenses related to publicity abroad, and up to fixed limits for certain other expenses. Nonresident enterprises producing for export within the framework of Title 2 of Law No. 87-51 may freely make payments abroad for their production activities; amounts in convertible dinars credited to the Business Travel Accounts of resident firms covered by Title 2 of Law No. 87-51 may be freely transferred up to D 6,000 a year for business travel; amounts unused over two consecutive years may be carried over, provided that the total of such transfers does not exceed D 10,000 in any one year. A business travel allocation may be authorized by the Central Bank for industrialists and businessmen whose professional activity requires travel abroad and who are unable to open EFAC accounts or business travel ac- counts based on Title 2 of Law No. 87-51. The annual allocation for each beneficiary is initially determined by the Central Bank at the time of approval, taking into account the applicant's import turnover. In the years thereafter, the annual amount of the allocation is deter- mined by the authorized intermediary with which the authorization is domiciled, using the same criteria. Payments for certain other current invisibles are ap- proved up to fixed limits. Residents traveling abroad as tourists are entitled once a year to an exchange allocation equivalent to D 100 a person (D 50 for children over 2 and under 12 years of age). The annual settlement allow- ance for students is the equivalent of D 500 for all countries; the monthly foreign exchange allowance for educational expenses abroad is the equivalent of D 400 for students in Canada and the United States, D 300 for those in Western European countries, and D 240 for those in other countries. A foreign national employed under contract may transfer up to 50 percent of his net wage or salary without limit if his family is not resident in Tunisia and subject to a maximum of D 150 a month if his family lives in Tunisia.2 Foreign experts employed by the public sector may transfer abroad their monthly salaries up to the limits specified in their contracts. Foreign salaried workers born in Tunisia may transfer 30 percent of their net basic salaries, up to D 80 a mon th. Regardless of nationality, residents traveling abroad by air or sea are subject to a travel tax of D 45 a trip. Nonresidents, diplomats, persons traveling under the "Agence de Cooperation Technique," emigrant workers, a man or woman residing in Tunisia whose spouse resides abroad, children living in Tunisia, one or both of whose parents reside abroad, students, pilgrims to Mecca, and those traveling for medical reasons are exempted from the tax. The export of Tunisian dinar bank notes or coin is prohibited. Unless central bank permission is obtained, 2 There are special regulations for foreign nationals employed by nonresident manufac tur ing enterprises covered by Law No. 72-38. TUNISIA the reconversion of domestic bank notes by nonresident travelers is restricted to 30 percent of the amount of foreign currency previously sold, with a maximum of D 1,000 if the traveler's stay in Tunisia exceeds 24 hours; if it does not exceed 24 hours, there is no limitation on the reconversion. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Most exports are liberalized, but certain nonenergy ex- ports (amounting to about 3 percent of the total in 1986) require export licenses issued by the Ministry of National Economy. The export of wine is the monopoly of the Office du Vin; the export of cereals, that of the Office des Cereales; and the export of olive oil, that of the Office National de THuile. With the exceptions noted below, all export proceeds must be repatriated and surrendered, normally within ten days from the date payment is due. If no credit is extended, payment is due within 30 days from the date of shipment. Central bank approval is not normally required, under certain conditions, for the ex- tension of export credits of up to 180 days. Resident exporters may sell forward for a maximum term of 6 months (12 months for hoteliers), through authorized intermediaries, foreign currencies representing the pro- ceeds from their merchandise exports. Exporters, hotel owners, travel agencies, and all pro- viders of services abroad may arrange to credit part of their export proceeds to special EFAC (Exportations- Frais Accessoires) accounts denominated in convertible dinars. For exporters the limits are 4 percent if export proceeds are repatriated more than 30 days after shipment of the merchandise, and 6 percent if repatriation occurs within 30 days following shipment. Hotel owners, travel agencies, and other external services industries may credit to such accounts up to 4 percent of their foreign exchange proceeds. Authorized intermediaries may grant surety bonds and performance bonds to resident exporters and to resident exporting enterprises eligible under Title 2 of Law No. 87-51. Resident manufacturing industries that produce exclusively for export and are approved under the terms of Title 2 of Law No. 87-51 may arrange to credit 2 percent of their repatriated convertible currency export proceeds to Business Travel Accounts in Con- vertible Dinars. Under the provisions of Title 2 of Law No. 87-51, nonresident manufacturing enterprises (i.e., enterprises with at least 66 percent capital ownership by nonresidents and financed through the import of convertible currencies) producing exclusively for export are exempt from the requirement of repatriation and surrender of export proceeds. Proceeds from Invisibles Residents must repatriate and surrender all amounts derived from services rendered to persons resident abroad and also all other income or proceeds from invisibles received from foreign countries. However, there are certain EFAC facilities for such proceeds or resources 487 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TUNISIA (see sections on Special Accounts on Foreign Currency or Convertible Dinars and Exports and Export Proceeds, above). Foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) may be brought in freely; nonresident travelers wishing to re-export the equivalent of over D 500 must make a currency declaration upon entry. The import of Tunisian dinar bank notes and coin is prohibited. Capital All nonresidents who invest in Tunisia are required to obtain the prior approval of the Tunisian authorities in order to be able to transfer the principal of, and all current earnings from, such investments. Foreign investment in Tunisia may, in accordance with the sector involved, obtain the benefits provided for by the Investment Code (Law No. 69-35); Law No. 82-67 of August 6, 1982, providing incentives for investment in the agricultural and fishery sectors; Law No. 84-20 of May 9, 1984, concerning export trading companies; Law No. 86-85 of September 1, 1986, providing incentives for investment in tourism; and Law No. 87-51 of August 2, 1987, providing incentives for investment in manufactur- ing industry and for industrial decentralization. These benefits include a number of tax facilities as well as a guarantee of the right to repatriate invested capital in foreign exchange and the net proceeds from its sale or liquidation, even if these exceed the initial foreign ex- change investment, plus the income from its capital. Furthermore, Title 2 of Law No. 87-51 provides for various special benefits for nonresident manufacturing enterprises, including an exemption from the repatriation requirement in respect of export proceeds. Under Law No. 85-108 of December 6, 1985, concerning incentives for financial and banking establishments conducting busi- ness essentially with nonresidents, the field of activity of such institutions has been extended; and they are au- thorized to exchange cash and traveler's checks for their nonresident customers and to engage in banking and exchange operations with residents, in particular by providing foreign exchange financing for foreign trade operations, investing their own foreign exchange re- sources in equities of resident enterprises, and accepting funds from residents that could be used to finance pro- ductive activities in Tunisia. Foreign nationals who have been residents of Tunisia and have left Tunisia permanently are entitled to the transfer of the following: 50 percent of their assets (with a minimum of D 1,750 and a maximum of D 3,500) for those who left Tunisia before August 20, 1970;3 D 4,000 for those who left between August 20,1970 and December 31, 1973; D 5,000 for those who left between January 1, 1974 and December 31, 1974; D 10,000 for those who left after December 31, 1974; D 15,000 for those leaving Tunisia after December 31, 1978, who are over 60 years 3 Such persons may transfer D 1,750 if the total amount of their assets does not exceed D 3,500. 488 of age, and are Tunisian nationals; and D 25,000 for those of French nationality residing and working in Tunisia as of October 25, 1980 and who subsequently retired and left Tunisia permanently after that date. All capital transfers by residents and all loans to nonresidents require the approval of the Central Bank. Donations or the proceeds from inheritances accruing to nonresidents are credited to Capital Accounts under certain conditions. The amortization of loans taken up with Central Bank approval from nonresidents is freely transferable. Gold Five denominations of commemorative gold coins are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may acquire and hold gold in any form in Tunisia. The Central Bank has a monopoly over the import and export of monetary gold. Other imports of gold require joint authorization by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Only dentists and specified cooperatives of industrial users are eligible to purchase gold from the Central Bank. The export of gold is prohibited. Changes During 1987 Resident and Nonresident Accounts April 21. Regulations governing accounts in foreign currency and in convertible dinars opened in the name of residents were revised. Imports and Import Payments February 20. The export turnover ratio, which qualifies enterprises to import under the import certificate system and for which no prior authorization is required, was reduced from 25 percent to 15 percent, and most remaining raw materials and spare parts (since the 1986 liberaliza- tion), except for products manufactured by import indus- tries, were transferred to the import certificate system. June 13. The import certificate procedure was extended to raw materials and semifinished products of enterprises that are authorized to manufacture pharmaceutical products. June 23. Enterprises exporting less than 15 percent of output were permitted to import under the import certif- icate system for imports up to the value of their exports. Payments for Invisibles November 23. The annual settlement allowance for students abroad was established at the equivalent of D 500 for all countries, and the monthly foreign exchange allowance for educational expenses abroad was increased from the equivalent of D 300 to D 400 for students in Canada and the United States, from the equivalent of D 240 to D 300 for those in Western European countries, and from the equivalent of D 180 to D 240 for those in other countries. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TURKEY (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Turkey is the Turkish Lira. The authorities of Turkey do not observe margins in respect of exchange transactions, and Turkey follows a flexible exchange rate policy under which exchange rates for the lira quoted by the Central Bank are adjusted on a daily basis. The Central Bank maintains a margin of 0.5 percent between buying and selling rates. The commercial banks establish their selling rates daily at the same level as that of the announced official selling rate of the Central Bank; their buying rates can be set freely. The commercial banks are also free to establish their own buy ing and selling rates in the interbank market. Foreign exchange transactions between the Central Bank and the commer- cial banks take place through the interbank market. On December 31, 1987 the Central Bank's official buy ing and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were LT 1,018.35 and LT 1,023.44, respectively, per US$1. On that date, the average buy ing and selling rates in the interbank market for the U.S. dollar were LT 1016.60 and LT 1022.97, respectively, per US$1. A Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme (FERIS) is designed to provide domestic borrowers with an ex- change rate guarantee for approved foreign borrowing. Foreign borrowing under the scheme is on-lent in Turkish liras at a domestic interest rate determined on an annual basis. The difference between the domestic interest rate charged on the foreign borrowing and any bank commis- sion is credited to the scheme. The d ifference between the lira cost at the time it is contracted and the lira cost of repayments is covered from resources of the scheme. Commercial banks can freely deal in forward transactions within the predetermined limits imposed by the Central Bank. Forward transactions must be related to imports and exports of goods and services w i th terms from 15 days to 6 months. Forward exchange rates are freely established between the banks and their customers in accordance with international practices. Banks enter into swap transactions with the Central Bank w i th terms of quarterly periods up to 12 mon ths; banks use this facility mostly to provide Turkish lira. Administration of Control Exchange and trade controls are the responsibility of the Prime M in is try, to which the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade is attached. Administration of exchange controls has been delegated to the Central Bank, which regulates all matters related to foreign exchange operations. All commercial banks have been authorized by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and For- eign Trade to engage in foreign exchange operations on their own account, including allocating foreign exchange for imports not subject to prior permit. In the case of imports subject to prior permit, authorized commercial banks directly allocate foreign exchange and issue import licenses upon receiving the approved import permit from the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade. Export registration is carried out by trade organizations, according to instructions from the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade; the Undersecretariat also issues export licenses but may delegate this authority to the relevant trade organizations. Prescription of Currency and Nonresident Accounts Settlements under bilateral payments agreements are made in U.S. dollars. Certain commercial transactions with Albania, Algeria, Bangladesh, Czechoslovakia, Iraq, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Malta, Morocco, Poland, Romania, Sudan, Tunisia, and the U .S .S .R ., and with the other members of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) are made through spe- cial accounts denominated in U.S. dollars. Settlements with all other countries are made in convertible currencies. Nonresidents as well as residents may open accounts denominated in foreign exchange with authorized com- mercial banks. Such accounts are disposable at the discretion of the holders. Imports and Import Payments All goods are freely importable except those explicitly prohibited or subject to prior permit. Only imports of narcotics, stereopten, weapons, foreign coins made of silver and other metals (excluding foreign coins made of gold), and ammunition are prohibited without a special permit from the authorities. Imports of other goods are divided into two categories. The first, which contains goods subject to licenses issued by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade, consists of 111 items, mainly raw materials, spare parts, intermediate goods and tools for indus try, and electrical equipment. The second category of imports covers goods not subject to prior licensing; within this category are a number of items that can enter the country only after payment of a specific levy (in addition to customs duties) to certain extra budgetary funds ("funds list"). The magnitude of the levy varies between items, and their structure has been changed from time to time. The importation of all goods not included in either of the above lists is freely permitted with payment of customs duties. However, imports of sold, used and reconditioned, defective, substandard, soiled, or poor quality goods may only be made with special permission from the Under- secretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade; when such goods are needed for a project, permission may be given by the State Planning Organization. Imports from coun- tries where foreign trade is nationalized may be carried out by public sector companies, individual companies, or foreign trade-incorporated companies, provided they ex- port to these countries. All imports by the public sector 489 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TURKEY have to be authorized by the Underscoretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade. All commercial imports require import licenses, which are valid for six months. The validity may be extended by an authorized commercial bank for up to 12 additional months and can be further extended by the Undersecre- tariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade. Import licenses are issued to registered importers, industrialists, state eco- nomic enterprises, and government departments. In the case of freely importable items, including those in the 4' funds list," no special permit is required for any au- thorized person to apply for an import license to any bank. The import license permits the necessary foreign exchange payments to be made, and the clearance of goods from customs. Payments for imports may be made against letters of credit, documents, or goods (i.e., upon customs clearance), or by way of acceptance credits. Partial prepayments are authorized under certain conditions. Guarantee deposits, which must be made by the im- porter before the import license is issued, are refunded after the goods are cleared through customs and the foreign payment has been made; these deposits do not earn interest. The general guarantee deposit rate is 7 percent of the foreign exchange requested, which is applicable to imports by commercial importers.1 Imports for the Izmir International Fair, some imports of the public sector, importers who make use of their own foreign exchange account to pay for imports, electrical energy, books and other publications, portions of imports paid with a foreign credit with more than a one-year term, imports of fuel oil, natural gas, wheat, sugar, coal, fertilizer, vegetable oils, medicine, x-ray photographs, imports from the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, imports of specially equipped cars for the disabled, and imports covered by an incentive certificate for regions with a development priority are exempted from the guarantee deposit requirement. Exporters who make use of their own foreign exchange accounts to pay for imports not subject to prior authorization are exempted from placement of guarantee deposits; they are also exempted from this requirement for up to the equivalent of 20 percent of the foreign exchange held in such accounts in the case of imports subject to prior authorization. Regulations concerning imports without allocation of foreign exchange by the banking system mainly affect imports of goods for personal or professional use by travelers domiciled in Turkey, and temporary imports by Turkish workers employed abroad and maintaining foreign exchange accounts with the Central Bank. Customs duties range mostly up to 15 percent in the case of raw materials, between 10 percent and 30 percent for intermediate and semifinished products, and between 30 percent and 40 percent for finished goods; higher rates apply to certain consumer goods considered luxuries. Imported goods are also subject to (1) a municipal tax of 15 percent of the applicable customs du ty; (2) a stamp 1 This rate was raised to 15 percent on February 4, 1988, but is scheduled to be reduced to 7 percent by May 1, 1988. 490 duty of 6 percent of the declared value; (3) a quay duty of 5 percent on the sum of c.i.f. value, customs duty, municipal tax, and customs clearance expense. A 5 percent import surcharge is levied on certain iron, steel, and plastic products from the European Communities (EC). Payments for Invisibles Specific Central Bank authorization is required only for specified types of transactions; all other invisible transactions are handled by commercial banks within norms issued by the Central Bank. The following trans- actions are subject to specific licensing by the Central Bank: (1) revenue of foreign contractors rendering inter- national tender in Turkey; (2) preliminary expenses of Turkish contractors undertaking tender abroad; (3) trans- fers related to copyrights for scientific and artistic works (up to US$10,000 may be provided in advance by the Central Bank); (4) proceeds of foreign air transportation companies; (5) payments related to certain kinds of insurance; and (6) revenue of foreign consulates. The transfer of income related to foreign investment and the payment of interest on foreign credits are permitted freely within the terms of Foreign Capital Law No. 6224 and similar laws and regulations. All resident Turkish nationals may travel abroad with a maximum of US$3,000 each without proof of exchange allocation by commercial banks. Banks are allowed to allocate up to US$1,500 a person a trip for tourist travel, or US$750 a person a trip for travelers under 18 years of age. Foreign nationals domiciled in Turkey may purchase from banks foreign exchange for up to US$200 a trip. For business travel, the allowance is up to US$2,000 a person a trip. Special limits, as well as administrative norms, are in force for the purchase of foreign exchange for travel and other expenses related to medical treatment, study and other training, and attendance at conferences. Out- bound travelers are subject to a tax equivalent to US$100, payable in Turkish liras, regardless of whether there are related purchases of foreign exchange; the tax is reduced by one half in the case of travelers 18 years of age or younger. Individuals engaged in border trade with the permission of the governor of the province concerned and immigrants and refugees traveling abroad are required to pay the tax in Turkish liras equivalent to US$25 and US$50, respectively. Exempted from payment of this tax are: (1) all foreign nationals; (2) participants in pilgrimages to Mecca for the first time; (3) Turkish workers employed abroad and their families; (4) crews of ships and planes, and truck drivers; (5) those living in border areas and who may leave the country by Administrative Permits; (6) those going abroad for medical treatment and their escorts; (7) private students going abroad for education purposes; and (8) civil servants (and their families) sent abroad on permanent assignment. Travelers are permitted to take out up to the equivalent of US$1,000 in Turkish bank notes and coins. Nonresi- dents may take out without restriction the unspent portion of the foreign exchange that they brought in. Provided ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution that the foreign exchange was declared at the time of en try, nonresident travelers can reconvert liras into for- eign currency upon presentation of a document showing that foreign exchange had previously been sold to an authorized dealer in Turkey; documentary evidence is not required for foreign exchange not exceeding US$100. Turkish workers employed abroad and persons domiciled abroad may freely take abroad with them foreign exchange in excess of US$3,000 or its equivalent, provided that such amounts were declared on arrival. allowed for the surrender of at least 80 percent of export proceeds is three months from the date of export. Under an export tax rebate scheme, direct and indirect taxes paid are refunded for the exported goods consisting mostly of the industrial goods. The maximum level of rebate as of the end of 1987 was 8 percent of the export value. The export of certain goods is encouraged by the payment of premiums from the Price Stabilization Fund at various amounts based on the physical quantities of the exported goods. TURKEY Exports and Export Proceeds Commercial exports fall into the following categories: (1) exports subject to permission of the Undersecretary of Treasury and Foreign Trade, including temporary exports; transit trade; re-exports; exportation of already imported goods in their original form; exports made to substitute already exported goods that could not be delivered to or had been rejected by their buyer and have been brought back or committed to be brought back or permitted for sale under other conditions since their return is not considered economical; forward sales; barter trade and related transactions; exports from free zones in or outside Turkey or from duty-free warehouses that are not subject to license or registration against convertible for- eign exchange; and exports to be realized by the con- struction companies that are awarded construction, in- stallation, and erection work abroad; (2) exports subject to the license issued by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade or the authorized Professional Insti- tutions, applicable to the following ten items (rice, fodder, crude vegetable oils, oil seeds, all live or dead hun t ing animals or their meats, hides, furs and embalmments, all kinds of hides and leathers —raw, semifinished or finished leathers or sole-leathers—live cattle and sheep, opium poppy head, liquorice roots, and fertilizers except chem- ical fertilizers); (3) exports subject to registration, includ- ing exports on consignment or on joint account (fresh fruits except citrus, fresh vegetables including onions and potatoes, wine except from EC countries, Turkish delight and candies, meat products, all kinds of fresh and frozen water products except crawfish, gift articles except car- pets, kilims, and prayer rugs), exports on credit, exports related to bilateral agreements, and exports of certain products to specific countries that are determined by the Undersecretariat and required to be registered as "Free Export Declarations"; and (4) free exports (exports not based on any permission, license, or registration) requiring registration as "Free Export Declarations." Barter trade is prohibited, except in permitted cases. Authorized public sector agencies and export companies with export earn- ings of at least US$50 million a calendar year may enter into barter trade. The surrender requirement for foreign exchange earn- ings in the case of merchandise exports is 80 percent. Foreign exchange not surrendered may be deposited in foreign exchange accounts with commercial banks, left abroad, or otherwise disposed of. The maximum period Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange accruing to residents for services rendered by them to nonresidents is required to be repatriated to Turkey, but there is no specific time limit for this obligation. Individuals residing in Turkey may accept foreign currency from nonresidents for transac- tions processed in Turkey. There are no limits on the importation of Turkish bank notes and coins. The importation of foreign currency is unrestricted. Capital Nonresident individuals and corporations wishing to invest in Turkey must import the required capital in the form of foreign exchange or in kind and must obtain a license from the Foreign Capital Department of the State Planning Organization. Consistent with the prevailing foreign investment policy, proposals in almost all sectors of business are approved, provided that a minimum of 50 percent of foreign capital is brought in by foreign investors. Exempt from this requirement are certain investments made in accordance with the provisions of the Law for the Encouragement of Foreign Investments, or the Petroleum Law, or investments authorized to be made through the use of blocked funds by the Foreign Capital Department. Proceeds of sales and liquidation of foreign capital may be transferred out of the country on the approval of the Foreign Capital Department, which should inform the Central Bank of the amount to be transferred. However, the Foreign Investment Directo- rate, as an administrative practice, evaluates the transfer proposals, with the aim of preventing evasion of laws and regulations. Resident individuals or corporations may invest abroad up to the equivalent of US$3 million in cash or in kind with authorization from the Undersecre- tariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade; higher amounts must be approved by the Council of Ministers unless the investment is financed by foreign currency obtained outside Turkey. Individuals or corporations authorized to invest and conduct commercial activities abroad must provide information about their activities to the Under- secretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade, including the submission of an annual report of activities at the end of the calendar year. Reasonable income from real estate and proceeds from real estate sales not exceeding the purchase value of related real estate in foreign exchange inflow can be transferred abroad through the banks upon presentation 491 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TURKEY of documents showing previous inflow equal to at least the initial property value. Income from real estate acquired without conversion of foreign exchange can be used in Turkey in the form of local currency but cannot be transferred abroad; proceeds from such real estate sales must be blocked at the Central Bank. Blocked funds are those accrued or accruing to nonresidents but not trans- ferable under existing exchange control regulations. These funds may be used in Turkey for authorized investments, provided that 50 percent of the funds are to be brought in from abroad as foreign exchange, for living expenses of owners and relatives (up to certain ceilings), contri- butions to public organizations, etc. Commercial banks may open "exchange accounts" or "convertible Turkish lira accounts" for individuals resid- ing in Turkey or abroad. Funds in such accounts may be freely disposed of by the holders, and interest rates and other conditions on the above accounts are freely nego- tiable between the parties. Commercial banks are free to conduct foreign exchange transactions according to their needs. In addition, banks are obligated to hold foreign exchange liquidity against letters of credit commitments, acceptance credits, pre-export financing, and foreign exchange loans guaranteed by banks with a maturity of up to six months, as well as direct foreign exchange borrowing of the banks. The ratio of all foreign currency- denominated assets to the sum of foreign currency de- posits plus foreign exchange overdrafts and foreign ex- change loans received from abroad is subject to an exchange rate risk ratio requirement (at the end of 1987, this ratio was between 0.90 and 1.1 for all banks). The minimum utilization ratio of foreign currency deposits is 50 percent —i.e., banks must extend 50 percent of foreign currency deposits as foreign currency-denominated loans to Turkish exporters. Gold The Central Bank of Turkey is authorized to import gold to Turkey and carry out the purchases and sales of it to the public freely. Import and export of processed precious metal stones and goods for commercial purposes are subject to regulations within the export and import regime. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 20. The rates at which authorized dealers other than banks can buy and sell foreign bank notes were limited to at most 2 percent above the daily rate at which the Central Bank sells foreign bank notes. Authorized dealers were allowed to charge commission for their services without restriction. Imports and Import Payments January 1. The number of items subject to prior approval was reduced from 245 to 111. Virtually all the items became subject to levies for financing extrabudge- tary funds. April 22, May 22, July I, September 17, October 24, and November 18. Levies for the Mass Housing Fund were lowered selectively for a number of items. In the course of the year, additional items were brought within the coverage of the levy, while others were abolished. Rates on a number of items were also changed. October 18. The rate of levy on imports for the Support and Price Stabilization Fund was raised from 4 percent to 6 percent. Payments for Invisibles June 8. Foreign exchange regulations pertaining to invisible payments were revised. The authority of com- mercial banks to effect payments was expanded. Exports and Export Proceeds January 12. Premia paid to cotton exports were dis- continued and replaced by a surtax. At the same time, import levies on cotton and cotton yarn were virtually eliminated. February 20. The Central Bank liberalized conditions for its export credit facility. The amount of financing to be provided was raised from 25 percent to 50 percent of the total value of export commitments. At the same time, it was announced that the export tax rebates paid to exporters would be advanced. The amount of advance rebates to a firm would depend on the value of exports and their destination. May 16. Twenty-nine export items became eligible to receive premia from the Support and Price Stabilization Fund, bringing the total number of products eligible for these premia to 68. November 18. With retroactive effect from September 1, 6 items became eligible to receive premia from the Support and Price Stabilization Fund, bringing the total number of products eligible for these premia to 81. Proceeds from Invisibles April 28. Entities earning foreign exchange from con- struction or international transportation services were made eligible to use part of the proceeds for direct imports. June 30. The policy of paying differentiated premia for various categories of exports from the Support and Price Stabilization Fund was expanded to receipts from tourism. The premium was set at 2 percent. 492 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UGANDA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Uganda is the Uganda Shilling. The official exchange rate of the Uganda shilling is fixed against the U.S. dollar at a rate of U Sh 60 per US$1.1 The Bank of Uganda rarely deals in foreign currencies2 other than the deutsche mark, Japanese yen, Kenya shilling, pound sterling, and U.S. dollar. On December 31, 1987 the official buying and selling rates were U Sh 59.50 and U Sh 60.25, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for other currencies are determined on the basis of the cross rates for the U.S. dollar in the international market. In its foreign exchange dealings, the Bank of Uganda charges a commission of 0.4 percent buying and 0.6 percent selling. Authorized commercial banks in Uganda deal in all specified currencies3 at rates quoted by the Bank of Uganda or, for a currency not quoted, at rates calculated according to prevailing cross rates. Authorized banks may, subject to exchange control approval, deal forward with customers in sterling, U.S. dollars, and other currencies, provided that there is an underlying approved import or export contract. Autho- rized foreign exchange dealers impose a service charge of not more than 0.5 percent. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange risk. Administration of Control The Bank of Uganda administers exchange control on behalf of the Minister of Finance. Import and export control is administered by the Ministry of Commerce. The Minister of Commerce has powers to prohibit imports and exports. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency The Bank of Uganda holds reciprocal accounts with the central banks of Kenya and Tanzania, which are settled in U.S. dollars. Authorized payments, including payments for imports, by residents of Uganda to residents of foreign countries other than Israel and South Africa may be made in Uganda shillings to the credit of an External Account in Uganda, or in any other currency that is appropriate to the country of residence of the payee. Receipts from such countries may be obtained in Uganda shillings from an external account in Uganda or in any convertible currency. Payments to Israel and South 1 On May 15, 1987 a new Uganda shilling was introduced, with one new shilling replacing 100 old shillings. 2 Foreign currencies are all currencies other than the Uganda shilling. 3 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish and Faeroese kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, Span- ish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, and all currencies of the former Sterling Area other than the Uganda shilling. Africa are prohibited. Certain settlements with Burundi, Rwanda, and Zaire are channeled through special ac- counts. Uganda maintains bilateral trade and payments agreements with Cuba, Egypt, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and Yugoslavia. External Accounts Accounts in Uganda shillings held by residents of foreign countries who are living in Uganda are designated external accounts. They may be credited freely with authorized payments by residents of Uganda, with trans- fers from other external accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of any foreign exchange currency and gold by nonresidents of Uganda to authorized dealers. They may be debited freely for payments to nonresidents, for trans- fers to other external accounts in Uganda, and for pur- chases of foreign currencies from authorized dealers. Nontransferable funds of persons not resident in Uganda are credited to blocked accounts maintained with com- mercial banks. Subject to prior approval, balances on blocked accounts may be used for the purchase in Uganda of specified bonds and shares issued in Uganda; the redemption proceeds of government bonds so acquired are transferable beginning five years from the date of purchase. Subject to individual permission, such balances may also be used for payments to residents not related to export transactions. Convertible Currency Accounts Private Ugandan nationals or institutions with funds abroad may be authorized to operate Convertible Cur- rency Accounts with commercial banks in Uganda. In- tending operators of such accounts are required to disclose the sources of the funds and to put up a minimum of the equivalent of US$5,000 to open the account. These accounts can be freely debited, and other governing regulations are similar to those for the regime of External Accounts (see above). The minimum balance in each such account must be at least US$3,000, below which the account is liable to closure by the Bank of Uganda. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Most imports are controlled through the foreign exchange allocation system. A monthly foreign exchange budget is prepared by a Ministerial Committee on Foreign Exchange Allocation, comprising the Prime Minister, the Ministers of Energy, Finance, Transport, Planning, Industry, and Commerce, and the Minister of State in the Prime Min- ister's office. Within this framework, decisions on indi- vidual requests for private sector imports (as well as payments for invisibles and official debt service payments) are made by the Foreign Exchange Allocation and Import 493 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UGANDA Licensing Committee, chaired by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Uganda. Foreign exchange allocations to various ministries and departments must be backed by documents showing approval of the Central Tender Board, an original budget authorization, and the signature of the Secretary of the Treasury or a duly designated officer. Once an importer has received a foreign exchange allo- cation, an import license is granted automatically. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce, and a commission of 0.5 percent of the license value is levied. An exception to the above procedures is made for imports in sectors eligible for the Open General License (OGL) system. Under this system, which was introduced in November 1987, foreign exchange is made freely available for imports of inputs to five key industries (soap, tobacco, beverages, textiles, and cement). In practice, because the demand for imports under the OGL far exceeds the foreign exchange made available for this purpose, eligible firms are granted approval only for a specific total value of imports during a six-month period. Requests to draw on these amounts are considered in conjunction with the monthly foreign exchange budget formulation. The Central Bank may object to the granting of foreign exchange for such imports either because the quoted import price or the import volume is considered excessive. In the monthly foreign exchange budget, US$6 million is allocated for imports under the OGL. The Ministry of Commerce also issues licenses for private sector imports financed from the importers' own foreign exchange resources without an official allocation. In these cases, the Ministry examines the application to ensure that price and quantity are reasonable. Anyone wishing to import goods valued in excess of US$20,000 is required to submit pro forma invoices from three different suppliers, except in the case of repeater and proprietary imports. Normally, imports must be purchased directly from the country of origin. Documen- tary evidence showing that the goods have been imported into Uganda must be forwarded to the exchange control authorities within four months from the date of payment in the case of goods shipped by surface transportation, and within two months for goods brought into the country by air. Cash imports are permitted only on a c. & f. basis. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries are subject to approval by the Committee on Invisible Imports of the Bank of Uganda. Payments to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. For business travel a daily allowance of US$ 100-140 a person is granted, up to an annual limit of US$2,000 a person. The maximum yearly travel allowance for purposes other than business is US$500 a person. Expatriates working in Uganda may obtain allocations for travel outside Uganda at the time of their overseas leave, subject to the terms of the original contract. Foreign exchange is not normally released for nursery, primary, and secondary education abroad. Allowances for post- secondary education abroad are based on estimates of tuition fees, board and lodging, and incidental expenses; 494 foreign exchange is not normally provided when a com- parable level of instruction is provided in Uganda. Facil- ities exist whereby salaried foreign nationals may remit to their country of origin up to one third of their gross monthly earnings to cover family maintenance, savings, etc., provided that they are on a contract of employment that includes a firm commitment to leave Uganda upon expiry of the contract. At this time, they may also remit a further US$5,000. Allowances for medical and adver- tising expenses are considered on a case-by-case basis. Applications to remit profits, dividends, and interest payments are approved on a case-by-case basis. Payments by the private nonbank sector for all other invisible transactions and for certain capital transfers are subject to a combined limit specified below in the section on Capital. The export of Uganda bank notes and coin by travelers is prohibited, except that travelers may take out U Sh 300. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. All exports require licenses from the Ministry of Commerce and may be restricted to ensure sufficient supplies for consumption in Uganda. The Uganda Tea Authority has a monopoly over the export of tea; the Coffee Marketing Board, over the export of coffee; and the Lint Marketing Board, over the export of raw cotton. In 1986 the export monopoly of the Produce Marketing Board was extended from maize and beans to include soya beans, sesame seeds, and peanuts; the Uganda Leather and Tanning Industry was granted sole authority to export hides and skins; and Uganda Hardware became the sole legal exporter of timber. However, in November 1987, the monopolies of these three organizations were relaxed, and other exporters were to be permitted export licenses for the affected products, subject to determination by the relevant organization that price and quality were reason- able and domestic supply adequate. Export proceeds in specified currencies (see footnote 3) must be collected within four months for goods shipped overseas and within two months for goods exported to neighboring countries or by air to any destination and sold to an authorized bank for Uganda shillings. The authorized bank must in turn surrender these proceeds to the Bank of Uganda within three business days; failure to do so entails payment of interest at a rate of 5 percent above the LIBOR or prime rate in the country where the funds are held. Coffee and hides and skins are subject to export duty. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in specified currencies (see footnote 3) must be sold to an authorized bank within 48 hours. The import of Uganda bank notes and coin by travelers is prohibited, except that returning residents may bring in U Sh 300 a person. Travelers may freely bring in bank notes denominated in specified currencies and foreign currency traveler's checks. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Capital Capital transfers to all countries require individual exchange control approval, and those to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Foreign assets must be deposited with an authorized depository, except that residents of Uganda may be granted exemption in respect of specified former Sterling Area assets held prior to June 11, 1965. Residents of Uganda leaving permanently may normally transfer their assets up to the equivalent of US$10,000 per family unit from their declared assets. Amounts in excess of this are placed in a Blocked Account and invested in Government of Uganda securities. The prin- cipal is transferred after a period of five years; the accrued interest is also released but not remitted. Principal payments on nonguaranteed overseas borrow- ing by resident companies or individuals are transferable. There are no restrictions on nonguaranteed overseas borrowing by resident companies or individuals. Foreign investment is permitted in Uganda with or without gov- ernment participation. Certain industries, such as public utilities, transportation, telecommunications, shipping, and the marketing of key commodities, are wholly re- served for government ownership. In other key industries, such as textiles, brewing, animal feed manufacture, the dairy industry, and tourism, the Government may pre- empt a certain percentage of the ownership but does accept private investment from both domestic and foreign sources. To secure a guarantee of repatriation, it is necessary to obtain "approved status" for the investment in terms of the Foreign Investments (Protection) Act, 1964; in normal circumstances, approved status is given freely. Foreign and domestic investment in specified types of production requires approval under the Licensing Act of 1969. All imports and exports of securities require approval. Approval is freely granted for the purchase by nonresi- dents of Ugandan securities, provided that payment is received in an appropriate manner. The income from such securities is remittable, and the proceeds on resale are normally remittable also. A resident of Uganda may not send money abroad, for whatever purpose, without spe- cific exchange control approval. Prior exchange control approval is required for loans or overdraft facilities granted to a nonresident or to a corporate body resident in Uganda that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by persons resident outside Uganda. Payments by the private nonbank sector for all other capital transfers and all invisible payments not specified above are freely permitted up to an aggregate maximum allowance of US$500 a person a year, provided there is adequate evidence to support the application. UGANDA Gold A commemorative gold coin with a face value of U Sh 5 is legal tender but in practice does not circulate. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Uganda for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial and profes- sional users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in Uganda in any form other than jewelry. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance. Export licenses are not normally granted except for exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. The import of the following from all sources is subject to individual licensing: jewelry of gold, silver, or platinum; goldsmiths' or silversmiths' wares, including set gems; bullion in the form of ingots, bars, or sheets; and gold coin. Import licenses for gold bullion, gold jewelry, and gold coin are issued restrictively and only to goldsmiths. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement May 15. A monetary reform was introduced, under which a new currency was issued, with 1 new shilling replacing 100 old shillings. At the same time, the official exchange rate was adjusted from U Sh 1,400 = US$1 to ( N e w ) U S h 60 = US$1. Imports and Import Payments November 13. An Open General Licensing (OGL) system was introduced for the import of inputs by five essential industries: soap, tobacco, beverages, textiles, and cement. Firms in these sectors were allowed to apply for letters of credit from their commercial banks as of November 30. Under the new system, foreign exchange up to a specified six-month total for each firm is auto- matically granted for all such applications, unless the Bank of Uganda objects within one week. Objections will be allowed on two grounds only: either the quoted import prices or the import volumes are considered excessive. Of each monthly foreign exchange budget, US$6 million will be allocated for imports under the OGL. Exports and Export Proceeds November 12. The export monopolies of the Produce Marketing Board (maize, beans, soya, sesame, and pea- nuts), the Uganda Leather and Tanning Industry (hides and skins), and Uganda Hardware (timber) were liberal- ized. Other exporters were to be permitted to obtain export licenses, subject to determination by the appro- priate organization that price and quality were reasonable and domestic supply adequate. 495 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED ARAB EMIRATES1 (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the United Arab Emirates is the U. A .E. Dirham, which is pegged to the SDR at Dh 4.76190 = SDR 1. The United Arab Emirates has established margins of 7.25 percent around the official rate; since November 1980, the U .A .E. dirham has maintained an unchanged relationship with the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency, and the Central Bank publishes buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar only. On December 31, 1987 the official buying and selling rates were Dh 3.6690 and Dh 3.6730, respectively, per US$1. The Central Bank sets no limits on the amount of U.S. dollars that it is prepared to buy from or sell to any commercial bank. Commercial banks are free to enter into foreign exchange transactions including forward con- tracts related to commercial and financial transactions at rates of their own choosing; the rates quoted by com- mercial banks for currencies other than the U.S. dollar are determined on the basis of international quotations. There is a swap facility at the Central Bank, which the commercial banks may use to purchase dirhams spot and sell dirhams forward for periods of one week, one mon th, and three months. For each bank, maximum limits of US$20 million outstanding for one-month and three-month swaps and US$10 million outstanding for one-week swaps are in effect. There is also a limit of US$3 million in purchases a day for each bank for one-month and three- month swaps. Swap facilities are not available to banks having a short position in dirhams, except for the covering of forward transactions for commercial purposes. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The United Arab Emirates formally accepted the ob- ligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, on February 13, 1974. Administration of Control There is neither exchange control legislation nor an exchange control authority in the United Arab Emirates, and there are no registration requirements for inward or outward transfers. There is no regime of export and import licensing. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. No other prescription of currency requirements are in force. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. 1 The seven federated states of the United Arab Emirates are Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain, Ras al Khaimah, and Fujairah. 496 Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa and Israel are prohibited, as are imports of products manufactured by foreign companies blacklisted by the Arab League. Imports of a few commodities are prohibited from all sources for health or security reasons. Virtually all other commodities may be freely imported without an individual import permit, but only licensed parties can enter the import trade, and an importer can import only the commodities specified in his license. There are no restrictions on the availability of foreign exchange for payments in respect of permitted imports. With the exception of specified items, imports into the United Arab Emirates are subject to a customs duty of 4 percent of the c.i.f. value. Imports originating from member states of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) are not subject to any customs du ty. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports and re-exports to South Africa and Israel are prohibited. Virtually all commodities may be exported or re-exported freely and without an export license to any destination, other than South Africa and Israel. Each Emirate establishes its own export regulations. The proceeds from exports need not be repatriated or surrendered and may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles All payments for current invisibles may be made freely, with the exception of paymen ts to South Africa and Israel, which are prohibited. There are no requirements governing receipts. Travelers may take out and bring in any amount in foreign or domestic bank notes. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or paymen ts by residents or nonresidents. Not less than 70 percent of corporate shares of financial institutions (excluding banks) must be held by nationals or organizations of the Un i ted Arab Emirates; the chair- man and two th irds of the board of directors must also be nationals of the United Arab Emirates. Commercial banks operating in the United Arab Emirates are prohib- ited from owning real estate except for the purpose of carrying on business and for accommodation. Under the United Arab Emirates Company Law (Law No. 8, 1984), at least 51 percent of the equ i ty of companies, other than branches of foreign companies, must be held by nationals of the United Arab Emirates. Profits on foreign capital invested in the United Arab Emirates may be remitted freely.

Gold Residents and nonresidents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. They may also, without a permit, import and export gold in any form, but the import of gold for trade purposes is under- taken only by licensed parties. Gold bullion is exempt from import du ty but jewelry is not. Changes During 1987 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 497 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED KINGDOM (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the United Kingdom is the Pound Sterling. The authorities of the United Kingdom do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and the exchange rate is determined largely by the balance of market forces. Whether the rate is rising or falling, the authorities intervene in the foreign exchange market to moderate excessive fluctuations and preserve orderly markets. On December 31, 1987 the closing selling and buying rates for the U.S. dollar in the London foreign exchange market as observed by the Bank of England were US$1.8865 and US$1.8875, respectively, per £ 1. Banks are allowed to engage in spot and forward exchange transactions in any currency, and they may deal among themselves and with residents and nonresidents in foreign notes and coin at free market rates of exchange. The United Kingdom formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Administration of Control There are no exchange controls. The licensing of imports and exports is handled mostly by the Department of Trade and Industry, but other departments also issue licenses in specialized fields. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Imports and Import Payments Payments for imports may be made freely. For import licensing purposes, countries outside the United Kingdom are divided into ten groups: the ACP Area;1 the CEFTA Area;2 the Community Area;3 the Dollar Area;4 the Far Eastern and Western Area;5 the Mediterranean Area;6 the 1 The ACP Area comprises Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, C6te d'lvoire, Djibouti, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Ma- lawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, Sao Tom6 and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Solomon Islands, St. Kitts and Nev is, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sudan, Suriname, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanua tu, Western Samoa, Zaire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. 2 The CEFTA Area comprises Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin (West), Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. 3 The Community Area comprises all EC member states. 4 The Dollar Area comprises Bolivia, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Liberia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, the Philippines, the United States, and Venezuela. 5 The Far Eastern and Western Area comprises Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. 6 The Mediterranean Area comprises Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. 498 OCT Area;7 the State Trading Area;8 the Residual Textile Area;9 and all other countries. With the exception of certain textile goods,10 most imports are admitted under an open general import license without restriction, with the following exceptions as at the end of 1987: (1) from all countries, two commodities or groups of commodities;11 (2) from the Dollar Area only, one group of commodities; (3) from the Dollar Area, the Far Eastern and Western Area, the Residual Textile Area, and the State Trading Area, one commodity; (4) from the German Democratic Republic, Berlin (East), and the U.S.S.R., one group of commodities; (5) from the State Trading Area only, seven commodities or groups of commodities; and (6) from South Africa only, two com- modities or groups of commodities. Individual import licenses are required where goods cannot be imported under the authority of the open general import license; some items are subject to surveillance licensing under which import licenses are issued freely on demand to applicants providing certain information. Most articles subject to specific import licensing can be imported in limited quantities under bilateral or global quotas. A few articles may be imported under open individual licenses, that is, without limit as to quantity or value. Imports of cereals and cereal products, beef and veal, mutton and lamb, poultry meat, and dairy products other than butter and cheese are subject to minimum import prices enforced through autonomously imposed variable import levies.

Sterling bank notes may be dispatched to nonresidents against payment in sterling or in any foreign currency. For any type of travel, U .K. residents can obtain on demand from banks and travel agents such foreign exchange as they may require without limitation. The cost of accommo- dation, fares, etc., can be paid for without limit in the United Kingdom. Personal checks may be cashed abroad and credit cards may be used without restriction. Travelers may take out any amount in sterling or foreign currency notes. Resi- dents may retain unused travel exchange expressed in foreign currency after return to the United Kingdom. Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports are free of export control, and there are no requirements affecting export proceeds.12 Under the Tender to Contract Facility of the Export Credit Guar- antee Department, exporters bidding for major capital projects in Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, or U.S. dollars when the United Kingdom element of the contract is for the equivalent of at least £ 10 million may obtain cover against exchange rate fluctuations between the submission of their bid and the award of the contract. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts in foreign currencies on account of invisibles may be retained or may be sold for sterling. British and other bank notes may be brought into the United Kingdom freely. Capital There are no restrictions on capital transfers by resi- dents of the United Kingdom into the beneficial ownership of residents of other countries. All proceeds from the realization, redemption, or maturity of sterling capital assets (including direct investments) are remittable at the market rate of exchange. Residents of the United Kingdom who leave with the intention of residing abroad may transfer all their assets on departure from the United Kingdom. Repatriates who, having been resident in the United Kingdom, return to take up residence in any other country may transfer all their sterling assets abroad at the market rate of exchange. Investments, whether direct or portfolio, may be freely made in the United Kingdom by nonresidents or abroad by residents.13 However, cases involving the takeover of 12 Exports of certain commodities are controlled for reasons of national security, animal welfare, national heritage, and international agreements. 13 Except that there is a voluntary ban on new direct investment in South Africa by residents, which was announced on October 30, 1986. UNITED KINGDOM existing U .K. companies that by their size or nature constitute a vital part of British industry may be subject to consideration under the provisions of the Fair Trading Act of 1973. The Government also has powers under the Industry Act of 1975 to prevent or undo undesirable foreign takeovers of important manufacturing undertak- ings, but these powers have never been used. There are no restrictions on transactions in sterling or foreign currency securities, which may be exported or imported without formality. Warrants issued by registrars, company secretaries, and paying agents in respect of interest, dividends, and capital payments on securities registered in the names of nonresidents may be dispatched abroad freely. Banks may freely accept foreign currency deposits and employ them in their foreign currency business or convert them to sterling, subject to prudential guidelines issued by the Bank of England concerning the limitation of risks arising from their foreign exchange exposure. Net spot liabilities in foreign currencies (i.e., the net amount of foreign currency resources funding sterling assets) form part of a bank's eligible liabilities that are subject to a 0.45 percent non-interest-bearing deposit requirement with the Bank of England and may also be subject to calls for special deposits to be placed with the Bank. There is currently no special deposit call. Gold Gold bullion and gold coin are not subject to control in the United Kingdom, other than imports of gold coins minted in or after 1961 and originating in South Africa. Gold sovereigns and Britannias, a new gold coin intro- duced in October 1987, are legal tender but do not circulate. Gold coins have also been issued in Jersey and the Isle of Man and are legal tender there. Except under license granted by the Treasury, it is an offense to melt down or break up any metal coin that is for the time being current in the United Kingdom or that, having been current there, has at any time after May 16, 1969 ceased to be so. The export of gold in manufactured form over 50 years old and valued at £ 8,000 and over for each item or matching set of items also requires a license from the Department of Trade and Industry. There is a free gold market in London in which gold bars are freely traded. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments (See Appendix II on the European Economic Com- munity (EEC) for a summary of antidumping duties, countervailing charges, and import surveillance measures introduced or eliminated on an EEC-wide basis during 1987, page 541.)

Not for Redistribution UNITED STATES (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the United States is the U.S. Dollar. The U.S. authorities do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and spot and forward exchange rates are determined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange markets. However, the au- thorities intervene when necessary to counter disorderly conditions in the exchange markets or when otherwise deemed appropriate. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The United States formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from December 10, 1946. Administration of Control The Department of the Treasury administers licensing programs involving direct or indirect financial or com- mercial transactions with Cuba, the People's Republic of Kampuchea1, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,1 the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, or their nationals, as specified under the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, the Foreign Assets Control Regulations, and the Libyan Sanctions Regulations. It also has administrative responsibility for blocked accounts of the above countries, as well as accounts of Estonia, the German Democratic Republic, Latvia, and Lithuania, blocked since World War II under the Foreign Funds Control Regulations.2 The Department of the Treasury also regulates certain trade and trans- portation-related activities involving Nicaragua under the Nicaragua Trade Control Regulations and the Islamic Republic of Iran under the Iranian Transactions Regula- tions, and administers restrictions on certain trade and investment activities involving South Africa under the South African Transactions Regulations pursuant to the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. The Customs Service of the Treasury Department administers import quotas; such quotas, however, are frequently established or allocated by other agencies. The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements, chaired by the Department of Commerce, with represen- tatives from other agencies, decides when to request consultation with countries to limit imports on the basis of the guidelines of the Multifiber Arrangement (MFA) and bilateral restraint agreements. Import quotas on specified dairy products are administered by the Depart- ment of Agriculture through the issuance of import licen- 1 As cited in the relevant national regulations. 2 Restrictions on payments to the Islamic Republic of Iran, except for payments from Iranian assets blocked as of January 19, 1981, were revoked on January 19,1981, pursuant to Executive Orders and regulations issued thereunder. Iranian assets blocked as of January 19, 1981 have, with limited exceptions, been transferred to the Islamic Republic of Iran or to various escrow accounts as set forth in the January 19, 1981 agreements between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran. 500 ses. Global quotas on sugar and products containing sugar are set on an annual basis by the Secretary of Agriculture. For items subject to export control —other than munitions items —the Department of Commerce is, in general, the responsible authority. There are no restrictions on foreign payments, except those imposed under Treasury Department regulations for security reasons on transactions involving the au- thorities or nationals of Cuba, the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya; those on trade and related transactions involving Nicaragua; those on loans and investments involving South Africa; and, to a very limited extent (see footnote 2), those affecting certain assets of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities. However, certain payments to Cuba, the People's Re- public of Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya related to authorized travel are permitted, as are certain payments in connection with travel to and in the United States by nationals of these countries. Limited remittances to the remitter's close relatives in Cuba and the Socialist Re- public of Vietnam are also permitted. Imports and Import Payments Imports originating in Cuba, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the Demo- cratic People's Republic of Korea, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Socialist Republic of Viet- nam, and Nicaragua are prohibited under Treasury reg- ulations, unless specifically authorized. In addition, im- portation is prohibited from South Africa of gold coins, uranium in the form of ore or oxide, coal, textiles, iron and steel, military articles, agricultural products, food, sugar, and any products grown, produced, manufactured, marketed or otherwise exported by parastatal organiza- tions of South Africa, pursuant to the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. The same Act prohibits the importation of gold coins from the U.S.S.R. Import quotas are in effect for certain products, in- cluding cotton, certain cotton waste and products, most dairy products, peanuts, sugar and certain sugar products, and certain specialty steel products. Quotas may be imposed by the President under specified conditions on certain types of meat. All quantitative import quotas, except those for peanuts, certain cotton products, butter, butter oil, certain other dairy products, and certain sugar products, are on a country-of-production basis. Certain dairy products that are subject to quotas are also subject to import licensing. The United States is a party to the MFA negotiated within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution and Trade (GATT) and to 41 bilateral textile agreements negotiated in accordance with the Arrangement's provi- sions. These agreements control trading partners' exports of textiles and apparel to the United States and provide for orderly expansion of trade without disrupting U.S. markets for these products. Imports from both agreement and nonagreement countries are monitored along with domestic industry performance to determine if market disruption exists or is threatened. When necessary, con- sultations are requested to establish limitations. Imports of a number of manufactured products are also effectively restricted by bilateral agreements or by the multilateral procedures of GATT Article XIX designed to provide temporary relief to certain distressed indus- tries, including motorcycles (the temporary relief for which was terminated in October 1987, six months before it was scheduled to expire). A Free Trade Area Agreement is in force with Israel, and such an agreement was concluded with Canada and is pending Congressional approval. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for developing countries has been in operation in the United States since January 1976 and is scheduled to continue through July 4, 1993. Under a procedure referred to as 4'product graduation," eligibility can be withdrawn for a particular product in which a beneficiary country has become competitive, so as no longer to require a tariff preference. Cumulative treatment under the GSP scheme is extended to members of the Andean Group, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM); cumulation allows two or more member countries of an eligible association to contribute jointly to the requirement that at least 35 percent of the direct cost of producing a given product should originate in the beneficiary country. Ex- empted from competitive needs limits is a category of countries designated as "least-developed" beneficiaries; currently, 32 countries are thus designated.3 During the ten years ended in December 1985, duty-free imports by the United States under the scheme increased from US$3.2 billion to US$13.3 billion. Under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, 21 countries and entities4 have been designated to receive preferential tariff treat- ment on specified imports for the period through Septem- ber 30, 1995.

UNITED STATES directly on exports of crime control and detection equip- men t, as well as instruments and related technical data, to all countries except other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. The Department of Commerce admin- isters controls directly on exports of other goods from the United States and on re-exports of goods of U.S. origin from any area. (The Treasury Department admin- isters controls on exports to Cuba, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, the People's Republic of Kampuchea, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of goods of foreign origin by foreign firms that are owned or controlled by U.S. nationals.) All exports from the United States to Cuba, the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Re- public of Korea, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and Nic- aragua (with the exception of general publications, certain publicly available technical data and educational mate- rials, personal baggage, and similar items) are prohibited unless individually licensed by the Department of Com- merce and/or the Department of the Treasury. Exports of crude oil and petroleum products and materials and technology connected with nuclear power to South Africa are also prohibited, as well as exports of computer technology and items on the U.S. munitions list to specified South African agencies. Exports to all other countries, except Canada, of designated strategic mate- rials and equipment require validated licenses from the Department of Commerce. Persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction require a Treasury Department license to participate in transactions in stra- tegic goods involving certain socialist countries regardless of origin, unless the transaction is licensed by another member of the Coordinating Committe for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM). This program is administered pursuant to the Transaction Control Regulation. For many commodities, when exported to countries other than Afghanistan, member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), Cuba, the People's Re- public of Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and Nicaragua, distribution licenses may be obtained to cover multiple shipments. The licen- sing requirements applicable to Yugoslavia are less re- strictive than those applicable to other Eastern European countries. Under the Export Administration Act of 1979, which was amended in 1985, the President can suspend the export of goods for reasons of national security, foreign policy, or short supply in the domestic economy, although efforts are made to minimize the use of such authority. For agricultural commodities, such as wheat, flour, corn, sorghum, rice, soybeans and soybean products, cotton, and several others, exporting companies are required to participate in a reporting system that is designed to improve market information and to allow for more orderly exporting and, thereby, lessen substantially the need for 501 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED STATES government intervention. The proceeds of exports are not subject to exchange control. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments and transfers abroad may be made freely, except for payments to or for the account of the authorities or nationals of Cuba, the People's Republic of Kampu- chea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and certain payments relating to Nicaragua and South Africa.5 U.S. residents are allowed to remit up to US$500 a quarter to close relatives in Cuba and US$300 a quarter to close relatives in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. In addition, remittances of up to US$500 to Cuba and US$750 to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam are allowed to aid in a relative's emigration from those countries. Receipts of funds from Cuba, the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Re- public of Korea, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam are generally prohibited, as are certain types of payments from the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Certain transactions in connection with authorized travel in these countries are permitted. Receipt of funds from Nicaragua is prohibited to the extent that they relate to unauthorized transactions. Individuals leaving or entering the United States with more than US$10,000 in domestic or foreign currency, traveler's checks, money orders, or bearer-form negotiable securities must declare these to customs at the point of exit or entry. Capital Incoming or outgoing capital payments by residents or nonresidents are not subject to exchange control. In addition, inward and outward direct or portfolio invest- ment is generally free of any other form of approval requirement. Investments involving ownership interest in banks are subject to federal and state banking regulations. However, as noted above, there are restrictions on certain transactions with, or involving Cuba, the People's Re- public of Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and, to a lesser extent, Nicaragua (see footnote 5 concerning the Islamic Republic of Iran). New investments by U.S. nationals in South Africa are prohibited, subject to limited exceptions. The Johnson Act, 18 U.S.C. 955, prohibits, with certain exceptions, persons within the United States from dealing in financial obligations or extending loans to foreign governments that have defaulted on payments of their obligations to the United States Government. The Act does not apply to those foreign governments that are members of both the IMF and the World Bank. In addition, there are certain reporting requirements for travelers entering or leaving the United States when they are 5 Certain payments and transfers to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, its instrumentalities, and controlled entities involving stand-by letters of credit, performance bonds, and similar obligations with the Islamic Republic of Iran contracted prior to January 19, 1981 are subject to restrictions. 502 carrying more than US$10,000 in cash or negotiable instruments (as well as corresponding reporting require- ments for shipment of currency or bearer assets through the mails). In addition, ownership of U.S. agricultural land by foreign nationals or by U.S. corporations of which 5 percent or more is foreign-owned must be reported to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Certain states in the United States impose varying restrictions on purchases of land within their borders by foreign nationals. Member banks are discouraged by the Federal Reserve Board from soliciting or encouraging placement of de- posits by U.S. residents at their foreign branches, unless such deposits are placed to serve a definite, necessary purpose outside the United States. The foreign currency positions of banks, whether overall or with respect to individual currencies, are not subject to limitations of a quantitative nature, but banks are expected to follow normal banking practices and not maintain imprudent positions. U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks, as well as domestic banks, are subject to reserve require- ments by the Federal Reserve system. Loans and exten- sion of credit to or acceptance of deposits from the South African Government or its entities are prohibited; trade credits are exempted. Beginning December 3,1981, U.S. chartered depository institutions, U.S. offices of Edge Act and Agreement Corporations,6 and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks may establish international banking facilities (IBFs) in the United States. IBFs may accept deposits only from foreign residents (including foreign offices of domestic banks), from other IBFs, or from the institution estab- lishing the IBF. Such funds are exempt from reserve requirements of Regulation D. For nonbank foreign res- idents, the minimum maturity or notice requirement is two business days, and the minimum transaction amount is US$100,000. Funds raised by an IBF may be used only to extend credit to foreign residents (including foreign offices of domestic banks), to other IBFs, or to the entity establishing the IBF. Credit may be extended to nonbank foreign residents only if the proceeds are used to finance operations of the borrower or its affiliates outside the United States. Advances from an IBF to its establishing entity in the United States are subject to Eurocurrency reserve requirements in the same manner as advances to the establishing entity from the entity's foreign offices. A number of individual states (but not the Federal Government) have granted favorable tax treatment under state or local law to IBF operations. In addition, federal legislation was enacted to exempt deposits at IBFs from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance cov- erage and assessments.

Imports of South African Krugerrand and other South African gold coins, and gold coins minted in the U.S.S.R. are prohibited under the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, as are im- ports of gold bullion marketed by the Reserve Bank of South Africa. Commercial banks may deal in gold bullion and gold coin, with the same exceptions. Treasury licen- sing for importers, exporters, producers, refiners, and processors of gold is not required, with the same country exceptions. Producers of gold may sell their output in the free market, with the same country exceptions. Gold, but not counterfeit gold coins, may be freely imported, except from the countries mentioned above. U.S. gold coins are legal tender at their face value. Commercial imports of gold jewelry, except gold jew- elry fashioned from U.S.S.R. or South African gold coins, are free of quantitative restriction but are subject to import duty at a rate of approximately 12 percent. There is no duty on gold ore, bullion, or coin. All forms of gold must be declared at the point of entry into the United States. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments January 2. The Administration completed a General Review of the U.S. GSP.

Not for Redistribution URUGUAY (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Uruguay is the Uruguayan New Peso. Uruguay follows a floating exchange rate policy under which the exchange rate of the Uruguayan new peso is determined by market forces, although the Central Bank reserves the right, in principle, to intervene for the purpose of preventing disorderly conditions in the exchange mar- ket. Buying and selling interbank rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, on December 31, 1987 were NUr$279.5 and NUr$281.0, respectively, per US$1. Rates for other currencies are based on U.S. dollar rates in exchange markets abroad. A tax of 1.5 percent is levied on sales of foreign exchange in both the spot and forward exchange markets, if a transaction is settled in Uruguayan new pesos; the tax rate is 0.3 percent for sales of foreign exchange through interbank operations. Export proceeds are required to be sold to the com- mercial banks. There are no limits on the amount of foreign exchange that the Central Bank may sell to or buy from the Bank of the Republic, the Mortgage Bank, commercial banks, and banking and exchange houses. Uruguay formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from May 2, 1980. Administration of Control Exchange transactions are carried out through autho- rized banks, banking houses, exchange houses, and the Bank of the Republic. Any person or firm may conduct exchange transactions in the market. Exchange houses must be authorized by the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency Payments between Uruguay and the countries with which Uruguay has concluded reciprocal credit agree- ments may be made through accounts maintained with each other by the central banks, within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA); these countries are Ar- gentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mex- ico, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela. There are separate arrangements for trade in specified goods with Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, among other countries. All settle- ments are made in U.S. dollars or other convertible currencies. Imports and Import Payments All imports are subject to registration before the goods are shipped. The registrations are generally valid for 180 days, within which period goods must be cleared through customs. Most imports are subject to import surcharges. The surcharge rates are within a range of 10-45 percent and are payable to the Bank of the Republic at the time of registration. Full or partial exemption from these sur- charges is granted for imports from member countries of the LAI A, imports of agricultural inputs, imports by the public sector, imports of machinery., equipment, tools, and spare parts for certain priority industries, and imports under the temporary admission scheme. The Bank of the Republic also collects a consular charge of 4 percent on the f.o.b. value of certain imports. Most imports are also subject to a customs tariff (impuesto aduanero unico, IMADUN I) and a service charge (tasa de movilizacion de bultos, TMB), collected by the Customs Office. Tariff rates vary between zero and 15 percent. The service charge is 1 percent of the c.i.f. import price for most imports. There are exemptions to IMADUNI and TMB. The combined effective tariff rate (including surcharges, tariffs, consular fees, and service charges) is limited to a maximum of 45 percent. Import surcharges, IMADUNI, and TMB are calculated either on an officially assessed price (precio de referenda), on a minimum export price, or on the actual c.i.f. value, whichever is the highest. Payments for Invisibles There are no limitations on the export of foreign or domestic bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Foreign exchange proceeds from exports must be sold to the banks not later than 36 months after the expiration date of shipping documents. Exporters are eligible for rebates in respect of indirect taxes paid during the production process; these rebates replaced the system of tax credit certificates with effect from January 1, 1983. From time to time, and for special reasons (e.g., stock position, protection, or sanitary considerations), certain exports are forbidden or subjected to special conditions. Traditional exports, such as meat (mutton, beef, and horse), greasy wool (scoured and semiscoured), dry, salted, and pickled hides, and livestock on the hoof (except that of pedigree or pure crossbred), are subject to an export tax at the rate of 5 percent. Fish exports are eligible for tax credit certificates amounting to between 2 percent and 8 percent of the f.o.b. value of exports, which can be used by the exporter to pay taxes or social security contributions, or can be sold to a third party. Proceeds from Invisibles There are no surrender requirements on the proceeds from invisibles, and there are no limitations on the import of foreign or domestic bank notes. Capital Inward and outward private capital transfers by either residents or nonresidents may be made freely, with the 507 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution URUGUAY exception of certain inward and outward transfers relating to investments registered under the Foreign Investment Law. The amortization or liquidation proceeds of foreign capital registered under this law cannot normally be transferred abroad until three years after the date on which the investment was approved. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form in Uruguay or abroad. Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments August 26. The combined effective tariff rates (including surcharges, tariffs, consular charges, and service charges) were reduced, with a few exceptions, from 50 percent to 45 percent, from 45 percent to 40 percent, and from 35 percent to 30 percent. September 3. The official reference prices for textile products were reduced by 10 percent. Exports and Export Proceeds January 29-30. Exporters of leather goods, certain vegetable extracts, and beef and mutton extracts became eligible for rebates of indirect taxes. April 1. A system of registration for meat processors and exporters establishing minimum technical standards entered into effect. June 1. Exporters of citrus fruits became eligible for rebates of indirect taxes. June 17. The rates of incentive payments to fish exporters were lowered from a range of 3-11 percent to 2-8 percent. November 17. Exports of frozen and corned mutton became eligible for rebates of indirect taxes, and exports of live sheep were permitted. 508 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution VANUATU (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Vanua tu is the Va tu, pegged to the SDR at a rate of VT 142 = SDR 1. The Central Bank of Vanuatu buys and sells foreign exchange, and it quotes on a daily basis the rates of the va tu against Australian dollars, French francs, deutsche mark, Japanese yen, and New Zealand dollars on the basis of their respective values in terms of the SDR. The Central Bank deals with the commercial banks in Australian dollars, French francs, pounds sterling, and U.S. dollars only. Buying and selling rates are quoted on the basis of 0.375 percent on each side of a middle rate, bu t, in practice, transactions are conducted on the basis of a narrower spread. The Central Bank buys or sells foreign exchange only in transactions with the commercial banks for account of the Government or for its own operations. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar (for telegraphic transfers) were VT 99.39 and VT 101.58 per US$1, respectively. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Vanuatu formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from December 1, 1982. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts of residents and nonresidents. Debits and credits to all accounts may be made freely. Imports and Import Payments With the exception of the following, all items may be freely imported: any goods that are controlled under internal legislation in the interest of national health and well-being, such as arms and ammunitions, explosives, and dangerous drugs; certain plants, foodstuffs, and animals, which are also restricted and subject to autho- rization. Importation of cement, canned soft drinks, T-shirts bearing a Vanuatu motif, frozen chickens, and chicken pieces are controlled, either by absolute prohi- bition or by import licensing restriction. Import duties are levied mainly on an ad valorem basis on import values (c.i.f.). Certain high revenue goods, however, are liable to specific rates of import du ty levied on units of quan t i ty (in particular, spirits, wine, beer, tobacco products, and hydrocarbon oils). Imported goods that compete with locally produced equivalents are gen- erally liable to high duty rates. A 5 percent service tax is payable on most imported goods based on the duty- inclusive import value. Goods imported for a specific end-use, particularly those imported for projects likely to aid national, social, or economic development, may be approved for duty- free or duty- and tax-free importation by virtue of one of a number of statutory exemptions. Included in these are goods imported for sale to tourists, ships stores (including fuels), goods imported for processing and re-exportation, and goods imported for investment projects. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments for invisibles. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange proceeds from surrendered. invisibles need not be Exports and Export Proceeds With a few exceptions, no restrictions are applied on exports. Exports of trochus, green snails, beches-de-mer, and crustaceans1 are subject to authorization by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry. Copra and cocoa exports are channeled through the Vanua tu Commodities Marketing Board (VCMB), and exports of coffee are subject to authorization from the VCMB. Artifacts that are five years old or more are subject to authorization from the Cultural Center. Most exports are subject to export duties, mainly on an ad valorem basis (f .o .b .); specific duties are levied on some minor exports, including scrap metal and timber. There are no surrender requirements for export proceeds. Capital All inward and outward movements of capital are unrestricted. Gold There are no restrictions on gold transactions.

Not for Redistribution VENEZUELA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Venezuela is the Venezuelan Bolivar. Venezuela maintains a four-tier exchange rate system under which three of the exchange rates are pegged to the U.S. dollar and the fourth is a fluctuating rate. In the first market the Central Bank sells foreign exchange to the public in eligible cases at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1. The Central Bank may also sell foreign exchange at Bs 4.2925 = US$1 to banks, which may in tu rn sell to their customers at a rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1. Eligible payments at this preferential rate include those for (1) interest on private external debt authorized by the Dif- ferential Exchange System Office (RECADI) that fell due before December 31, 1983; (2) amortization of authorized and registered private external debt (defined as net liability position) eligible for immediate payment;1 and (3) amor- tization of 10 percent of debts other than those eligible for immediate payment. In the second market the Central Bank sells foreign exchange to the public at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1, and to banks at the rate of Bs 7.4925 = US$1 when the banks act as intermediaries, for the purpose of: (1) interest payments on external private sector debt registered at RECADI and falling due between December 31, 1983 and December 8, 1986; (2) current expenditure and capital expenditure abroad by the public authorities and public sector entities; (3) expenditure derived from the inter- national commitments of the Republic; (4) external public debt interest and amortization payments charged against the budget for fiscal year 1986; (5) external debt servicing of public enterprises, provided the debtor subscribes to the exchange guarantee scheme; (6) amortization pay- ments on registered private external debt other than those eligible for the Bs 4.30 per US$1 rate,2 and interest on private registered debt falling due after December 8, 1986, provided the debtor subscribes to the optional exchange guarantee scheme introduced in December 1986; (7) imports of ''essential" foods tuffs, medicines, and inpu ts for agriculture, clothing, and paper products (including 1 Debts amoun t ing to US$500,000 or less, export credits w i th foreign official guarantee due prior to Ju ly 17, 1986, and debts in the form of certificates of deposit or foreign currency deposits. Debts of between US$500,000 and US$1 m i l l ion, although eligible for immediate paymen t, are to be amortized at the rate of Bs 7.50 per US$1. Export credits w i th foreign official guarantee due after Ju ly 17, 1986 can be amortized at the rate of Bs 7.50 per US$1 on the ir respective dates of m a tu r i ty, if the debtor subscribes to the optional foreign exchange guarantee scheme, except for the amounts fa l l ing due af ter Ju ly 17, 1986 but prior to the signing of a contract between the debtor and the Central Bank, in wh ich case amortization paymen ts can be made immediately at Bs 7.50 per US$1.

In the third market the Central Bank buys foreign exchange at the rate of Bs 14.4925 = US$1 from the public and public sector entities for the proceeds from exports of goods and services (excluding tourism) and all public and registered private capital imports; it sells foreign exchange in the same market to the public at the rate of Bs 14.50 = US$1, and to banks at the rate of Bs 14.4925 = US$1 when the banks act as intermediaries, for the purpose of: (1) all imports of goods and services (excluding tourism) other than those eligible for the Bs 7.50 per US$1 rate; (2) public sector current payments abroad and paymen ts related to international commit- ments of the Government of Venezuela; (3) outward remittances to certain students abroad during 1987, and to all students abroad after December 31, 1987; (4) interest and amortization paymen ts on external debt contracted or serviced by the Central Governmen t; and (5) private debt amortization payments on registered debts eligible for but not covered by the optional exchange rate guar- antee scheme. In the four th market transactions take place at a freely fluctuating rate; this rate applies to tourism transactions and nonregistered private capital flows. The Central Bank may buy and sell foreign exchange at the fluctuating rate market, which operates through financial intermediaries. The banks and exchange houses in this market may establish different exchange rates according to the instru- ment being transacted, but the spread between buying and selling rates for the same ins trument may not exceed Bs 0.05 per US$1 in the case of banks, and Bs 0.15 per US$1 in the case of exchange houses. On December 31, 1987 the buy ing and selling rates for the U.S. dollar at the foreign exchange houses were Bs 30.40 = US$1 and Bs 30.50 = US$1, respectively. Buy ing and selling rates for other officially quoted currencies3 are based, for each market, on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in major markets abroad. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. In the case of interbank transfers, domestic banks may charge only the cost of the transfer, including commission and other charges by the foreign banks. Under the exchange rate guarantee scheme, debt- ors can acquire guaranteed access to foreign exchange at the rate of Bs 7.50 per US$1 by paying a premium (see section on Capital, below). As regards import operations using foreign exchange from the official market, cover is available as follows: (1) if the operation is covered by letters of credit, the exchange rate applicable for paying for the import will be the rate prevailing when the letter of credit is opened, provided no more than 360 days have 3 Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Portuguese escudos, pounds s ter l ing, Spanish pesetas, and Swiss francs. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution elapsed since the date on which the letter of credit was opened; (2) if the operation is carried out using facilities other than a letter of credit, the exchange rate applicable for the payment will be the rate prevailing on the date of shipment of the goods or, if the goods have not been shipped, on the date the legal documentation is issued attesting to the commitment assumed by the importer; (3) if the imports are effected in cash, the exchange rate applicable to the payment will be maintained for a period of 180 days from the date of shipment of the merchandise; and (4) if the import is financed with suppliers' credits, the exchange rate applicable to the transfer will be maintained for 360 consecutive days from the date of shipment of the merchandise. Venezuela formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, on July 1, 1976. Administration of Control Foreign exchange policies are established by the Min- istry of Finance, with the advice of the Differential Exchange System Advisory Committee. The committee is chaired by the Minister of Finance and includes the Minister of Development, the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock, the Minister of the Central Coordination and Planning Office, the President of the Central Bank of Venezuela, and the President of the Venezuelan Invest- ment Fund. The exchange control system is administered by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance. Import and export licenses are generally issued by the Ministry of Development or the Ministry of Agriculture and Live- stock, depending on the commodity. Import quotas and prohibitions within the multiple exchange rate system are established by the Ministry of Finance. The Superinten- dency of Foreign Investments (SIEX) exercises super- vision over foreign investment in Venezuela, over con- tracts for the importation of foreign technology and the use of foreign patents and trademarks, and over borrowing abroad. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements are in force. Payments between Venezuela and Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay may be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Bank of Venezuela and the central banks of the countries concerned. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. In addition, importation of certain goods is either prohibited or re- served for the Government; these include iron and steel products, luxury food, apparel, and specified consumer durables. Certain other commodities also require import licenses. For protective purposes, quantitative restric- tions are maintained on some of these items, irrespective of origin, except in the case of Andean Pact and Latin VENEZUELA America Integration Association (LAIA) member coun- tries. Licenses are valid for all countries except South Africa. Import licenses for some goods are issued on evidence that the importer has purchased domestic prod- ucts equal to a prescribed percentage of the quantity to be imported. Payments for imports of food, medicines, clothing, paper products, and agricultural inputs may be made at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1. All other goods that are not prohibited, reserved for the public sector, or subject to special regimes may be imported at the rate of Bs 14.50 = US$1 when authorized by RECADI, or at the free market rate. To have access to foreign exchange from the Central Bank for payment of imports, an importer must obtain an import license (conformidad de importa- tion) from the Directorate of Imports and the Ministry of Finance before the date of shipment of the goods; the license has a validity of 180 days, and may be renewed up to a period determined by the Directorate in each specific case. Import licenses are granted on the basis of semiannual import programs, which are approved for each individual firm at the beginning of each year. In the case of imports channeled through the official market and not effected through a letter of credit, im- porters must submit the import license to the Central Bank within 90 banking days from the date of customs clearance. The importer may obtain from the Central Bank the foreign exchange to settle his obligations as they become due, up to the total amount authorized in the import license, within 25 banking days after 120 days have elapsed since the date of shipment of the goods. In the case of imports effected through letters of credit, the importer may obtain from the Central Bank foreign exchange for the equivalent of up to 20 percent of the amount authorized in the import license. In the case of imports of raw materials for the manufacture of goods intended for exports by exporting firms registered with the Foreign Trade Institute, the importer may obtain from the Central Bank foreign exchange for the equivalent of up to 50 percent of the amount authorized in the import license issued by the Foreign Trade Institute. In both cases, the Central Bank issues a Certificate of Availability of Foreign Exchange for the total amount authorized minus the amount released earlier, which is valid for 360 days from the date of opening of the letter of credit. The importer must submit this certificate to the Central Bank (within 90 banking days from the date of customs clear- ance) to obtain from the Central Bank (within 25 banking days after 120 days have elapsed since the date of shipment of the goods) the remaining foreign exchange to settle the obligations under the letter of credit as they fall due. In the case of imports effected directly by public sector entities, foreign exchange equivalent to up to 100 percent of the authorized amount in the import license issued by the Ministry of Finance will be provided by the Central Bank within 60 days after submission by the public sector agency of the import license to the Central Bank. In accordance with the timetable issued by the Andean Pact Commission contained in the Protocol of Lima, 511 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution VENEZUELA Venezuela adopted the minimum external tariff in 1978 (Decree No. 2772 of August 3, 1978). It agreed, in principle, to harmonize external tariffs and eliminate all import duties on trade within the Andean subregion by December 31, 1983, in the prescribed annual stages. Payments for Invisibles Interest payments on registered private external debt falling due before December 31, 1983 are allowed to be made through the preferential rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1. Payments for the following categories of invisibles can be made at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1: (1) freight and insurance associated with imports made at this rate; (2) interest on the public and registered private external debt falling due after December 31, 1983, including interest on private or public entities' debts falling due after December 6, 1986 if the debtor chooses to opt for the exchange rate guarantee scheme; and (3) most outward remittances to students until December 31, 1987. The following invisible payments are effected at the rate of Bs 14.50 per US$1: (1) freight and insurance associated with imports made at this rate; (2) interest on the external debt of the Central Government or serviced by the Central Government; (3) other public sector current payments abroad; (4) outward remittances to some students until end-1987, and to all students thereafter; and (5) interest payments on regis- tered private debts not covered by the exchange rate guarantee scheme. Other payments for invisibles can be made through the free market, without limit. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of certain furs and hides, scrap metal, and a few other commodities are prohibited. Licenses are required for the export of commodities subject to price controls or deemed to be in short supply domestically; for most commodities, such licenses are issued by the Ministry of Development, but those for coffee, cacao, rice, and sugar are granted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. The export of precious stones and gold requires an export license issued by the Ministry of Finance. All export earnings by companies dealing in gold must be surrendered to the Central Bank at the exchange rate it uses for its operations in the free market. In the case of private exporters, the authorization to export is contingent on agreement to sell export proceeds to authorized banks within 30 days of shipment in the case of cash exports, and within 10 days of the due payment date in the case of exports on credit. All export earnings are to be surrendered at the rate of Bs 14.4925 = US$1. Exporters of coffee and cacao may receive an export subsidy calculated to prevent the f.o.b. bolivar prices of these products in Venezuelan imports from falling below specified minimum amounts, regardless of external prices. In principle, the benefit of these arrangements may be extended to firms processing domestic coffee or cacao for export. The promotion of nontraditional exports in Venezuela takes three basic forms: (1) the Export Fi- 512 nancing Fund, established in September 1973, provides direct credit facilities at interest rates below those charged by other lenders, and it also lends in conjunction with commercial banks; (2) the Export Incentive Law (Sep- tember 1973) assists nontraditional exports through fiscal subsidies in the form of tax credit certificates; and (3) exporters' access to foreign exchange for imports is facilitated. Under the Export Incentive Law, negotiable tax credit certificates with a two-year maturity are granted to ex- porters of nontraditional products (i.e., exports other than petroleum, iron ore, coffee, and cacao) that have a domestic value added greater than 30 percent. These certificates can be held to maturity and used to meet government tax liabilities, or can be traded in the local market at a discount. For the purpose of calculating the amount of the export subsidy, the domestic currency equivalent of the export value is calculated at the rate of Bs 14.50 = US$1. For firms exporting more than 15 percent of their production or more than US$250,000 per year, separate semiannual quotas for imports of raw materials, spare parts, and semifinished products are established at the beginning of each year; the Directorate of Imports issues individual import permits on the basis of these firms' applications and within their special import programs. Foreign inves tment projects or joint ventures with at least 80 percent production for exports may be authorized to effect all foreign exchange transactions through the free exchange market, except to the extent needed to cover bolivar operating costs. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles are to be surrendered at the rate of Bs 14.50 per US$1, except for receipts from tourism, which are freely disposable. Travelers may freely import domestic and foreign currency, with the exception that importation for commercial purposes of foreign coin other than gold coin is prohibited. Capital The national and local governments, autonomous agen- cies, and state enterprises (other than petroleum and iron ore companies) are required to surrender to the Central Bank at the rate of Bs 14.50 = US$1 all exchange proceeds from foreign borrowing; principal repayments on registered external debt of public sector entities are effected at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1, if covered by the exchange guarantee scheme, and principal repayments on the external debt contracted or serviced by the Central Government and on debts of public entities not covered by that scheme are effected at the rate of Bs 14.50 = US$1. All foreign exchange brought into Venezuela by the Venezuelan Investment Fund is subject to conversion at the rate of Bs 14.50 = US$1. Principal repayments of registered external private debt can be effected at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1, if the debt amounts to US$500,000 or less and is in the form of export credits with foreign official guarantee and fell due prior to July 17, 1986, or in the form of certificates of deposit or foreign currency ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution deposits. Registered debt amounting to between US$500,000 and US$1 million and export credits with foreign official guarantee due after July 17, 1986, but prior to the signing of a contract between the debtor and the Central Bank, can be amortized immediately at the rate of Bs 7.50 per US$1. For the remainder of private registered debts, amortization may take place on the respective dates of maturity at the rate of Bs 7.50 per US$1 under an optional exchange rate guarantee scheme. Debt eligible for registration was defined as the net liabilities position in foreign exchange as of February 18, 1983 of (1) banking, financial, and insurance companies; and (2) nonfinancial enterprises of mixed or Venezuelan ownership in the areas of manufacturing (if the debt was contracted for the acquisition of capital goods for use within the country), transportation and public services (if the debt was for the acquisition of equipment), and construction (if the debt was incurred for public sector works or works guaranteed by the public sector for social housing projects). Under the exchange rate guarantee scheme, debtors can acquire guaranteed access to foreign exchange at the rate of Bs 7.50 per US$1 for servicing their registered debts, over a period of eight years, by paying in advance a premium in bolivares. For private debts, the premium is Bs 3 per US$1 for amortization payments, and an additional variable premium of up to Bs 1.50 for each US$1 of registered debt for interest payments.4 A similar exchange rate guarantee scheme exists for external debts of state enterprises and auton- omous institutions that were contracted prior to February 18, 1983.5 Debtors have the option of subscribing to the exchange rate guarantee for part or all of the amortization payments or for part or all of the interest payments. Any debt-service payments of registered debt eligible for this scheme, but not subscribed to it by the debtor, can be channeled through the controlled exchange market at the rate in effect at the time of payment. In both cases, regardless of whether the exchange guarantee is sub- scribed, amortization payments are to be effected ac- cording to a prescribed (backloaded) schedule, and the interest rate is to be limited to LIBOR plus VA percentage points. Debtors may defer the payment of the premium over the eight-year period, in line with the schedule of debt service, by paying interest at a rate linked to domestic lending rates. All other inward and outward capital transfers by residents must be registered with SIEX in order to be eligible for the Bs 14.50 per US$1 exchange rate, although they are permitted without restriction in the freely fluc- tuating exchange market. However, brokerage activity in Venezuela in shares or un i ts of foreign investment trusts or mutual funds is prohibited. Foreign capital imported for investment purposes and all foreign credits must be 4 The premium varies according to the foreign interest rate under which interest payments are to be covered by the exchange rate guarantee (about Bs 0.17 per percentage point), up to a max imum rate of 9 percent. 5 In accordance w i th the longer repayment period established for such debts, the premium has been set somewhat higher than for private debts (Bs 3.50 for each U.S. dollar of principal, and Bs 0.25 for each percentage point of interest covered). VENEZUELA registered with SIEX. Foreign direct investment is gov- erned by Andean Pact regulations; a new foreign invest- ment code, however, has resulted in a substantial liber- alization of the system. Natural gas and iron mining operations are reserved for the State, and foreign invest- ment in the petroleum sector is prohibited; this restriction may, however, be lifted in exceptional cases. The Central Bank regulates bank credit to nonresidents and companies whose capital is more than 50 percent owned by physical persons or companies that are resident or domiciled abroad. The General Banking Law authorizes the Gov- ernment to regulate bank credit to companies whose capital is more than 40 percent owned by nonresident or foreign physical persons or companies. This law also regulates the activities of foreign banks operating in Venezuela. Interest earnings on loans extended by foreign financial institutions are exempt from the income tax. Decree 1521 and Exchange Agreement No. 4, in com- bination with the new Foreign Investment Code, regulate the conversion of public sector external debt into equity or financial assets in Venezuela. Debt-equity conversion is allowed if the intended investment is directed either at import substitution, export industries, preventing closure of Venezuelan enterprises, or 1 of 11 priority sectors. For a period of three years, after-tax dividend and profit remittances are limited to an annual rate of 10 percent of the converted debt; remittances in subsequent years are subject to the rules of the Foreign Investment Code. No capital repatriation is allowed for a period of five years, and during the following eight years, repatriation is limited to a maximum annual rate of 12.5 percent. The Central Bank acquires the foreign debt at par or at a discount to be determined in each individual case at an exchange rate o f Bs 14.4925 per US$1. Gold Venezuelan gold coins are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may hold, acquire, and sell gold coins in Venezuela for numismatic and investment purposes. The Central Bank does not deal in gold with the public, but gold coin, medallions, and bars are freely negotiated among authorized importers and exchange houses and the public. Commercial banks may freely negotiate gold coin among themselves and with other residents but do not normally deal in gold with the public. Imports and exports of monetary gold are reserved for the Central Bank, as are imports of gold coins that are legal tender in Venezuela. Imports and exports of nonmonetary gold (other than jewelry for personal use) and of gold coins eligible as legal tender in Venezuela or abroad are subject to prior authorization by the Central Bank. In addition, imports require licenses from the Central Bank and in certain cases also from the Minister of Development; exports require authorization by the Central Bank. As an incentive measure, export earnings by companies dealing in gold are converted by the Central Bank at the free market rate.

Central Bank Resolution No. 87-02-01 regulated the premium to be paid for the optional exchange rate guarantee for private debts. February 11. Only the net f.o.b. value of exports (net of freight, insurance, and marketing costs) was required to be surrendered at the exchange rate of Bs 14.50 per US$1. February 18. The possibility of effecting export trans- actions in Venezuelan bolivares was eliminated, except for exports under the economic cooperation programs administered by the Venezuelan Investment Fund. June 18. Central Bank Resolution No. 87-06-01 regu- lated the premia to be paid for the optional exchange rate guarantee of debts of state enterprises and autonomous institutions incurred prior to February 18, 1983. July 30. Central Bank Resolution No. 87-07-03 was announced, stating that the foreign exchange cost of letters of credit (opening costs of up to a maximum of 4l/2 percent of the f.o.b. value of the import plus interest at a rate of up to 11A percentage points above three-month LIBOR) is eligible to obtain foreign exchange at the same exchange rate as the respective import. November 12. Firms in the basic metals, chemicals, petrochemicals, mechanochemical, mining, and pulp and paper industries that export at least 80 percent of pro- duction were allowed to effect all foreign exchange transactions through the free exchange market, except to the extent needed to cover operating costs in bolivares (Decree 1779 and Exchange Agreement No. 6). November 27. Exchange Agreement No. 1 was amended, permitting repayment of debts assumed by the Govern- ment as guarantor at the exchange rate of Bs 7.5 per US$1. Administration of Control June 15. RECADI was abolished, and its functions were transferred to the two agencies of the Ministry of Fi- nance —the Directorate of Private Credit (private debt registration), and the Directorate of Imports (import authorizations) —and to the Central Bank (foreign ex- change authorizations). Imports and Import Payments January-June. A new import control system was put in place, under which at the beginning of each year the Directorate of Imports in the Ministry of Finance would allocate most of the annual foreign exchange budget among trade associations and individual firms; during the year, individual import permits would be issued by the Directorate on the basis of and within firms' annual programs. Release of foreign exchange was centralized at the Central Bank —i.e., the former requirement of a separate foreign exchange authorization from RECADI was eliminated. January-April. The advance given by the Central Bank on presentation of the import permit was raised in steps from 20 percent to 80 percent for those importers who had opened letters of credit prior to December 8, 1986, and to 50 percent for those who had opened letters of credit between December 8, 1986 and April 21, 1987. July 29. A separate foreign exchange budget for meeting the import needs of private exporters was created (Pro- grama de Insumos Bdsicos para la Exportacion). Under this program, firms exporting more than 15 percent of their production, or more than US$250,000 a year, would have accelerated access to foreign exchange for the importation of raw materials, spare parts, and semifinished products, on the basis of separate, semiannual import programs. Exports and Export Proceeds January 12. Coffee and cocoa were included among the goods that are eligible for the fiscal incentive regime. January 14. The fiscal incentives for private exports with an average domestic value-added content of 60 percent, 80 percent, and 95 percent were raised to 25 percent, 30 percent, and 35 percent, respectively. January 23. Exports under the San Jose Agreements were included in products that are eligible for the fiscal incentive regime. February 27. The requirement to present a bank guar- antee (finanza) was eliminated with respect to exports to the Netherlands Antilles. July 8. The fiscal incentives for private exports with an average domestic value-added content of 40 percent, 60 percent, 80 percent, and 95 percent were raised to 15 percent, 30 percent, 38 percent, and 48 percent, respectively. At the same t ime, the method of calculating domestic value added was simplified and the administra- tive procedures for subsidy payments were streamlined. Capital i April 24. Decree 1521 and Exchange Agreement No. 4 established the legal framework for the conversion into equity of public sector external debt, complementing the debt capitalization scheme existing under the new foreign investment code introduced in September 1986. 514 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution VIET NAM (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Viet Nam is the Dong. The exchange rate is quoted in terms of the U.S. dollar, to which it is pegged, and adjustments are made at irregular intervals. External transactions w i th the countries of the Council for Economic Assistance (CMEA) are settled in transfer- able rubles through clearing arrangements administered by the International Bank for Economic Cooperation (IBEC). Transactions w i th Albania, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the Democratic People's Re- public of Korea are settled with clearing (or bilateral) rubles. On October 15, 1987 the exchange rate of the dong for external trade transactions in terms of the U.S. dollar was adjusted from D 18 to D 225 per US$1, and the transferable ruble rate was adjusted from D 18 to D 150 per one transferable ruble. On December 1, 1987 the official exchange rate used for noncommercial transac- tions was adjusted from D 80 to D 368 per US$1, and the clearing ruble rate was adjusted from D 45 to D 240 per one clearing ruble. Un t il December 1, 1987 a 20 percent premium had been added to the official rate applied to international organizations based in Viet Nam and tour- ists; after that date, the premium was no longer applied to tourists. The rate applicable to inward remittances was changed several times during 1987. On April 21 the rate was adjusted from D 96 per US$1 to D 396 per US$1. On July 21 the rate was adjusted to D 504 per US$1.1 Following the fu lf i l lment of the export plan against the delivery of input by the Government, export-producing enterprises are entitled either to retain 10-30 percent of export earnings in deposits in foreign currencies or to use foreign exchange at their discretion; the remainder is required to be surrendered to the Government. In the case of exports not covered by the plan, the enterprises are entitled either to retain 70-90 percent of export earnings in deposits in foreign currencies or to use foreign exchange at their descretion; the remainder is required to be surrendered to the Government. In addition, import corporations receive export subsidies from the budget to cover their production and procurement costs, and the export subsidy fund that is operated for this purpose is financed by profits from import sales. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the State Bank of Viet Nam. Foreign trade is administered by the Ministry of Foreign Trade, which authorizes the foreign trade transactions carried out by specialized import-export corporations and some cooperatives or state enterprises. Import and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of 1 This rate was ad jus ted to D 900 per US$1 on February 24, 1988. Foreign Trade; approval is given for imports in excess of the plan on the merit of each application. Most official foreign exchange transactions are effected by the Bank for Foreign Trade. Most of the foreign exchange trans- actions related to foreign technical assistance are moni- tored by the Aid Reception Commission, which is an agency directly attached to the Cabinet of the Prime Minister. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Trade transactions with member countries of the CMEA are settled under the transferable ruble system adminis- tered by the IBEC. Transactions with Albania, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the Democratic Peo- ple's Republic of Korea are settled through individual clearing accounts using clearing (or bilateral) rubles. As a member of the CMEA, Viet Nam is entitled to use credits in transferable rubles from the IBEC to facilitate the clearing of transactions with the CMEA member countries. Viet Nam is also entitled to use credits from the IBEC to finance its external trade deficit with the CMEA countries, pending the conclusion of medium- or long-term financing arrangements with the trade parties. Viet Nam maintains a special current account in con- vertible foreign exchange with the IBEC for a petroleum joint venture between Viet Nam and the U.S.S.R. Non- trade transactions with countries with which Viet Nam has bilateral payments agreements2 take place at exchange rates specified in those agreements. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents are permitted to maintain nonresident accounts either in foreign currencies or in convertible dong. Nonresidents can freely reconvert into foreign currency and transfer abroad unused balances in Viet- namese currency that have been acquired against foreign currency. Imports and Exports An import plan and an export plan are drawn up annually on the basis of the overall annual plan and quotas agreed upon under bilateral trade arrangements. Import and export activities are regulated by Decision No. 177, which was issued by the Council of Ministers on June 15, 1985. Trade transactions are carried out by 28 centrally managed import-export corporations and 22 local trading compa- nies, which produce exportable goods themselves or purchase them from producers.

Not for Redistribution VIET NAM duced in 1987, some other enterprises can export directly, if the annual value exceeds US$2 million. All payments for external trade transactions are made through the Bank for Foreign Trade; export receipts are also normally channeled through the Bank for Foreign Trade. Local export companies are permitted to export all available commodities, including the 25 items previously under the monopoly of the central export-import com- panies. Local corporations may import only commodities appearing on a list approved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade, which is amended periodically. The procurement prices of exportable commodities and the domestic prices of imported goods are determined by local companies within ranges that are set by the State Pricing Commission for each group of commodities. In order to make better use of available marketing expertise and facilities, local trading companies in the provinces are permitted to enter into joint venture arrangements with trading companies located in various municipalities. Export companies benefit from subsidies whenever their procurement costs are not fully covered by the international prices of their exports converted to domestic currency at the exchange rate that is applied to trade transactions. For centrally managed companies, these subsidies are made available by the Export Support Fund, which is maintained by the Ministry of Finance. For locally managed companies these subsidies are paid out of profits made on imports, with the balance paid by the local government. Export permits are only granted when export subsidies do not exceed pre-established norms. An export bonus system has been in operation since 1980 to provide additional incentives for export produc- tion. Since June 15, 1985, the bonus for collective pro- duction units (cooperatives, cooperation teams, and pro- duction collectives) amounts to 4-5 percent of the value in domestic currency of their production of export goods if their plan quota is fulfilled. Central and local companies fulfilling their export quota are granted foreign exchange equivalent to 10 percent of their export earnings to import required inputs. Local trading companies are required to surrender 10-30 percent of their export earnings (in convertible currencies) that exceed the quota delivered to the State. However, many exemptions currently apply. For locali- ties that borrow in foreign currency, the surrender re- quirement is applied to their export earnings, net of their debt-servicing paymen ts, for a period of three to five years; companies operating in the highland area are exempted from surrendering foreign exchange for a period of five years after they start producing exportable goods. Centrally managed companies operating in the tourist sectors are exempted from the surrender requirement, and central companies exporting coal, rubber, and marine products are allowed to retain 80-100 percent of their export earnings to purchase necessary inputs from the convertible area. Deposits arising from foreign currency receipts are held in special domestic currency accounts that can be used for the purchase of foreign currency for imports. The right to use these convertible dong deposits 516 can be relinquished to other enterprises in exchange for the supply of inputs. State enterprises have two export plans. Primary export plans are formulated by the Government against deliveries of key inputs by the Government; secondary plans are set by the producing units without a sufficient supply of inputs (e.g., fuel) by the Government, thus leaving the task of procuring the needed inputs to the enterprises. New taxes on international trade were approved in December 1987, and they became effective in early 1988. Import duties ranging from 5 percent to 55 percent, with the majority of rates not exceeding 20 percent, were introduced. The lowest rates are levied on imports of raw materials and capital equipment, and the highest rates are levied on imports of consumer goods classified as luxuries (previously, import duties were levied only on noncom- mercial imports, and this duty was retained). The export taxes for most products range up to 10 percent. The taxes on international trade are calculated on the basis of the exchange rate applied to trade transactions (D 225 in December 1987). For imports from the nonconvertible currency area, annual foreign exchange is allocated to importers on the basis of actual production capacity; in principle, such foreign exchange cannot be carried over from one year to the next. For imports from the convertible area, although a similar foreign exchange allocation system exists in principle, it is not in use, as decisions to allocate foreign exchange are taken by the Prime Minister's Cabinet on a case-by-case basis, on recommendations from the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and specified Vice-Premiers. For transactions under the local produc- tion plans, local authorities are authorized to decide on foreign exchange allocation, provided that the resources are derived from their retained export earnings. Payments for Invisibles All transactions in invisibles require individual author- ization by the Ministry of Finance. Foreign exchange is made available upon authorization of the transaction. All travel abroad needs individual authorization from the Prime Minister's Cabinet, and is limited to official busi- nesses for which all reasonable foreign exchange expenses are covered.3 Receipts from transactions in invisibles must be surrendered to the Ministry of Finance. The export and import of Vietnamese currency and of securities denominated in Vietnamese currency need the special permission of the State Bank. The circulation of foreign currency in the domestic market is prohibited. Legal holders of foreign exchange are authorized to buy foreign and local consumer goods in special government shops, and tourists are required to make certain payments in convertible foreign currency. 3 As from February 1988, p r iva te travel has been permitted for specified reasons, including s tudy, health, and visiting relatives abroad. In the latter case, the traveler mu st have a round - t r ip t icket and adequate funds provided by transfers from the relatives abroad. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Capital A new law on foreign investment was approved by the National Assembly on December 29, 1987, providing for three forms of foreign investment: (1) contracted business cooperation, such as product-sharing arrangements; (2) joint ventures between a foreign investor and a Vietnam- ese state economic organization; and (3) categories wholly owned by foreign investors. The permitted share of foreign capital is to be no less than 30 percent, and there is no upper limit. Other provisions under the Investment Code include: (1) the duration of the enterprise with foreign capital, not to exceed 20 years, but if necessary, to be extended for a longer period; (2) a tax of 5-10 percent, to be levied on remittance of profits abroad; (3) income taxes, to be paid at the reduced rates of 15-25 percent, starting two years after the first profit-making year; and (4) possible exemptions from or reductions of import and export duties in exceptional cases. The Code also provides that foreign investors need to deal only with one orga- nization within the Government specifically created for that purpose. Gold The State Bank alone has the authority to purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. Individuals are permitted to own jewelry and artistic and cultural objects of gold for domestic and personal use. VIET NAM Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement April 21.

The two most important changes were (1) a minimum ratio of foreign capital in any venture of 30 percent, with no upper limit; and (2) a tax of 5-10 percent on profit remittances. 517 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution WESTERN SAMOA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Western Samoa is the Western Samoa Tala. The exchange rate of the tala is determined on the basis of a weighted basket of currencies. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates of the tala in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, were WS$1 = US$0.5018 and WS$1 = US$0.4928, respectively. Exchange rates for other currencies are established on the basis of their daily rates against the U.S. dollar. There is an exchange levy of 1 percent on gross sales of foreign exchange, resulting in spreads between the buying and selling rates in excess of 2 percent in exchange transac- tions. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk in the official or the commercial banking sector. Administration of Control Overall responsibility for the administration of ex- change control rests with the Central Bank of Samoa, which may delegate part of its powers to authorized banks. In principle, all payments to nonresidents of Western Samoa require the approval of the Central Bank of Samoa; the Bank of Western Samoa and the Pacific Commercial Bank —the only authorized banks—are em- powered to approve certain payments up to any amount, and certain other payments up to specified amounts. Prescription of Currency There are no prescriptions as to the currencies in which payments to or from nonresidents of Western Samoa must be made or received. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between the accounts of resi- dents and nonresidents of Western Samoa. Imports and Import Payments The import of a few commodities is prohibited for reasons of security or health. Other commodities may be imported from any source without restriction, with the exception of items subject to special approval on a case- by-case basis, namely motor vehicles, capital equipment in excess of dutiable values of WS$10,000, and a few items for which there are domestically manufactured substitutes.1 Import transactions other than for petroleum products and exceeding WS$5,000 are in each case re- quired to be made under letters of credit. Payments for Invisibles Payments for certain invisibles may be approved by the authorized banks up to specified limits. Payments in 1 Beer, cigarettes, timber, veneer, matches, and disposable cigarette lighters, sandals/thongs, bottled and canned soft drinks, and ice cream and ice cream products. 518 excess of these limits, as well as payments for all other invisibles, require the prior approval of the Central Bank. Remittances for study abroad are normally authorized. Approval of the Central Bank of Samoa is required in respect of all transfers of local earnings from dividends, interest, and pensions of overseas residents. Residents and expatriates traveling overseas for private purposes are entitled to a foreign currency allowance equivalent to WS$100 a person a day, subject to a limit of WS$2,000 a person a year; in the case of travel for business purposes, the daily allowance is WS$200 within a limit of WS$4,000 a trip. The Central Bank of Samoa grants supplementary allocations against evidence of genuine need. As part of their foreign currency allowance, resident travelers may take out foreign bank notes equivalent to WS$500 a person. Travelers may not take out any domestic cur- rency. A 15 percent withholding tax is levied on remit- tances of dividends at the source and interest payments on overseas loans. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require export licenses issued by the Cus- toms Department. Exports may be prohibited by the Director of Agriculture and the Produce Marketing Di- vision on grounds of low quality, or by order of the Head of State to alleviate domestic shortages. Exports of cocoa are controlled by the Cocoa Board. An export levy of 7 percent is imposed on the f.o.b. value of cocoa.2 Export proceeds from goods shipped to countries other than American Samoa must be surrendered to the au- thorized banks within four months from the date of shipment; export proceeds from goods shipped to Amer- ican Samoa must be surrendered to the authorized bank within four weeks from the date of shipment. Certificates validated by an authorized bank are required for exports in excess of WS$250. The following rates of export levies are applied: copra, 5 percent, activated at prices in excess of WS$100 per ton; copra meal, 3 percent; fruits and vegetables, 3 percent; veneer logs and sawn logs, 20 percent; rough timber, 5 percent to 15 percent; and coconut oil, WS$25 per metric ton. Proceeds from Invisibles All foreign currencies earned by residents in performing services for nonresidents must be surrendered to the authorized banks. Resident travelers must on return sell to the banks all unused foreign currency brought in. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount in foreign bank notes, but may not bring in any domestic bank notes. 2 The export levy on cocoa is activated at prices in excess of WS$800 a ton. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Capital All outward capital transfers by residents require the specific approval of the Central Bank of Samoa. Inward capital remittances do not normally require approval, but borrowing abroad by nonbank residents does require approval. The authorized banks approve transfers of gifts to relatives and dependents, either for special family occasions or by way of maintenance, up to WS$250 a year a person. Foreign investments in specified activities in Western Samoa are encouraged. The Enterprises In- centive Act provides for the granting of certain relief of income tax and business license fees to persons engaged in approved enterprises. Both the repatriation of capital and profit remittances on foreign capital are subject to approval by the Central Bank of Samoa; such approval is normally granted. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form. There are no restrictions on imports or exports of gold. WESTERN SAMOA Changes During 1987 Imports and Import Payments March 9. The interest-bearing advance deposit require- ment for the import of motor vehicles was abolished. Motor vehicle dealers were allowed to import motor vehicles as stock. September 1. Import items previously classified as 4'prohibited" (beer, cigarettes, timber, veneer, matches and disposable cigarette lighters) were reclassified as "restricted." Three items (sandals/thongs, bottled and canned soft drinks, and ice cream and ice cream products), which previously could be imported freely, were classified as "restricted." All requests for imports of "restricted" items were subject to the approval of the Central Bank on a case-by-case basis, and approval would normally be granted only in cases where shortages of the domestic equivalent could be proven, or where items were imported for sale through duty-free outlets. 519 ©International Monetary Fund.

Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies2 are fixed daily by the Central Bank of Yemen in its transac- tions, on the basis of rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. These central bank rates apply to limited public sector transactions.3 The Central Bank is the sole buyer and seller of foreign exchange in the domestic banking system. It purchases foreign exchange mainly from money changers (mainly in Jeddah) who acquire foreign exchange from Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia, and credits the accounts of the money changers with commercial banks in the Yemen Arab Republic. The exchange rate for these transactions, which constitutes the commercial bank rate, is negotiated. Commercial banks are allowed to purchase foreign exchange domestically (from tourists, etc.), but must sell any foreign exchange acquired to the Central Bank. Any external borrowing by commercial banks must be ap- proved by the Central Bank. The Central Bank provides foreign exchange to all holders of import licenses at the commercial bank rate. At the end of 1987, the commercial bank rate fluctuated around YRls 9.9 - US$1. An exchange rate of YRls 10 = US$1 i s u s e d f o r t he settlement of letters of credit. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. There is a large informal market in foreign exchange, mainly involving money changers in Jeddah, remittances agents, and Yemen Arab Republic citizens who have been or are working abroad. Although money changers are not officially permitted to operate in the Yemen Arab Republic, their activity is tolerated. Otherwise, individ- uals and companies are free to buy, hold, and sell foreign exchange. The exchange rate in this market forms the basis for the commercial rate. Administration of Control A foreign exchange budget is established by the Central Bank in parallel with a commodity budget prepared by the Ministry of Economy, Commerce, and Supply in consultation with the Central Bank. All imports require a license issued by the Ministry of Economy, Commerce, 1 On February 1, 1988, the official exchange rate was unified w i th the commercial bank rate at YR ls 9.75 = US$1 (buy ing) and Y R ls 9.77 - US$1 (selling). 2 Bahrain dinars, deutsche ma rk, French francs, Italian l ire, Japanese yen, Jordan dinars, Kuwa i ti dinars, Lebanese pounds, Ne the r lands gu i ld- ers, pounds sterling, Qatar rials, Saudi Arabian riyals, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U .A .E. dirhams. 3 These transactions are government loans and grants, official service receipts, government imports, debt service, and a small number of other invisible items. 520 and Supply. Transactions in invisibles are supervised by the Central Bank. All commercial banks operate in the foreign exchange market only as agents of the Central Bank. They are not allowed to buy or sell foreign exchange for their own account or for the accounts of their customers. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Settlements may be made in any currency. Imports and Import Payments An annual foreign exchange budget is prepared by the Central Bank, and is approved by the High Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister. Product priorities are determined by the Min- istry of Economy, Commerce, and Supply, and are established in the commodity budget. Imports from Israel and imports of certain types of used machinery for resale are prohibited. All other imports require licenses and must be processed through local commercial banks. In add i t ion, the importation of certain products requires the permission of certain government agencies, and imports of petroleum products are reserved for the Yemen Petroleum Company (YPC), a public corporation. With the exception of medical imports, insurance for all imports must be purchased locally. All importers ho ld ing an import license can obtain the nec- essary foreign exchange from the Central Bank. Margin deposits are prescribed against letters of credit opened for imports, as follows: 40 percent for foods tu f fs, medi- cine, and petroleum produc ts; 60 percent for raw mate- rials, spare parts, and building materials; and 100 percent for all other products .4 In addition to the applicable customs d u t y, imports are subject to a defense tax of 5 percen t, a statistical tax of 2 percen t, and a tax of 1 percent for reconstruction related to earthquake damage. Payments for Invisibles Payments for inv is ib les may be made free ly. The Central Bank (through its agents, the commercial banks) sells foreign exchange to travelers and those seeking medical trea tment abroad, w i th the amount dependent on their destination. In add i t ion, there are l im i ts on the amount of foreign exchange commercial banks may sell to trav- elers. There is a global mon th ly limit of US$10,000 for each commercial bank on sales to trave lers, and a limit of US$1,000 on sales to each ind iv idual trave ler .5 Larger amounts are granted w i th permission from the Central Bank; permission is granted rou t ine ly.

For statistical purposes only, all exports must be registered on forms that are issued freely by banks; export licenses are not required. Exporters may use 50 percent of their foreign exchange receipts to import either their own inputs, or any other permitted goods, as long as they have an import license.6 Exporters of qat are subject to an export duty of 12 percent. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be repatriated but may be retained in foreign currency accounts with domestic banks. Travelers may freely bring in any amount in foreign bank notes.

Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen is the Yemeni Dinar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at YD 1 = US$2.89524. Buying and selling rates for the pound sterling are also officially quoted by the National Bank of Yemen (the sole commercial bank and authorized dealer), with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. On December 31, 1987 the National Bank of Yemen's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were YD 0.343 and YD 0.350, respec- tively, per US$1. Rates for all other prescribed currencies are quoted weekly; additional adjustments are made when there are major changes in the market rates for these currencies in London and New York the previous day. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control The administration of exchange control is carried out by the General Department for Exchange Control of the Bank of Yemen (the central bank) through the Foreign Exchange Committee, which has delegated certain powers to the Director of Exchange Control, a member of that Committee. The Ministry of Trade and Supply issues import and export licenses; those for gold and other precious metals require the prior approval of the Director of Exchange Control. Exchange transactions must be carried out through the National Bank of Yemen. Other dealers in foreign exchange, who may deal only in traveler's checks and bank notes, are classified into ordinary money changers and secondary dealers. Ordi- nary money changers, whose principal business is to sell and purchase foreign exchange for their own account or for the account of the National Bank, are permitted to deal in specified currencies. Secondary dealers, such as hotels, travel bureaus, and retail stores selling tourist goods, are permitted to accept payment in foreign ex- change only from their customers and are required to surrender the receipts in foreign exchange to the National Bank not later than the following business day. The authorized bank and money changers are allowed to charge a commission for the purchase and sale of foreign exchange as specified by the Committee, but secondary dealers may not do so. Except for payments for imports against letters of credit or documents, which may be approved by the authorized dealer, all payments for imports (including those of precious metals) require the prior approval of the Director of Exchange Control. Certain public corporations are engaged in foreign trade (see section on Imports and Import Payments, below). 522 Prescription of Currency Exchange transactions must be carried out through the authorized dealer in accordance with prescription of currency regulations. All payments to Israel are prohib- ited. Export proceeds and certain receipts from invisibles must be received in convertible currencies and surren- dered to the authorized dealer; proceeds from exports or re-exports to specified neighboring countries may be surrendered in the currencies of such countries. Payments for imports must be made in prescribed currencies. Nonresident Accounts External Accounts in Yemeni dinars may be credited with proceeds from convertible foreign currency trans- ferred from abroad, with bank interest payable on such accounts, and with balances from other External Ac- counts. Transfers from abroad must be in the form of bank drafts; the accounts may not be credited with payments in the form of foreign bank notes (unless they have been declared to customs on entry), or with locally raised or locally earned funds (except in certain specified cases). External Accounts may be debited for any pay- ments to residents, for transfers to other External Ac- counts, and for payments abroad in any convertible currency. Transfers abroad from External Accounts in Yemeni dinars require the prior approval of the Exchange Control Department. The Foreign Exchange Committee may direct any payment to a nonresident to a Blocked Account. Except with the Committee's prior approval, Blocked Accounts may be debited only for purchases of specified securities. Yemeni nationals working abroad may establish non- resident accounts in foreign currencies; balances in these accounts earn interest and are convertible into foreign currency on demand. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel are prohibited. Imports of cars other than those needed for development projects are also prohibited. All imports require individual licenses. Goods originating in the Yemen Arab Republic are exempt from the licensing requirements. There is an annual import program. Importers may import certain goods with their own exchange; such imports require prior approval by the Ministry of Trade and Supply. Payments for imports on a c. & f. basis against letters of credit or documentary drafts can be made by authorized dealers without the prior approval of the Director of Exchange Control; most other forms of payment for imports require approval. Insurance on imports must be effected locally. The National Company for Foreign Trade has a mo- nopoly over imports of all consumer goods, with the exception of medical supplies and hospital equipment, which are handled by the National Company for Drugs. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution It is also the sole importer of automobiles and other vehicles, all government requirements, and most require- ments of the public hospitals, as well as other specified items. Imports into and exports from the free port zones within the port of Aden are free of exchange and trade controls (except in respect of transactions between these zones and the rest of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen) and are exempt from customs duties, except that the proceeds of exports and re-exports financed originally by the authorized bank are subject to the surrender requirement (see section on Prescription of Currency, above). In all cases, exporters from the free zones are required to undertake to repatriate in convertible currencies commissions, profits, and other expenses re- lating to the processing of goods in the zones and to surrender the currencies to the authorized bank. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require prior approval by the Director of Exchange Control. The "Inducement to Invest Law" divides foreign investments into two cate- gories: (1) projects that realize self-sufficiency in their requirements for foreign currency, which may remit net annual profits due on invested capital within the limit of the credit of their exports; and (2) projects of primary importance for the national economy, which may remit the whole of the annual net profits due on capital invested. Projects that were set up prior to 1971 may remit all of their net profit. The basic exchange allowance for tourism is the equiv- alent of YD 100 a person a trip to all destinations other than the Yemen Arab Republic (the allowance for the Yemen Arab Republic is YRls 2,000); for children aged between 2 and 10 years, the basic exchange allowance is one half of these amounts. Allowances for medical treat- ment abroad are normally granted in accordance with the amount estimated by the Ministry of Health. Allowances for other types of travel are granted on the merits of each application. Foreign employees of approved enterprises are allowed to remit abroad between 50 percent and 100 percent of their total earnings (net of taxes) according to the terms of the contract; other foreign employees, if receiving their salaries from abroad, are allowed to remit 70 percent of their total earnings. Nonnationals doing business in the country can remit abroad up to the equivalent of YD 50 a month for family maintenance. All insurance is nation- alized; existing policies have been transferred to the National Insurance and Reinsurance Company, and pay- ments abroad in respect of premiums are not permitted. Travelers may take out the equivalent of YD 5 in domestic bank notes and up to the equivalent of YD 125 in traveler's checks, foreign bank notes, or other foreign means of payment. Nonresidents may take out any foreign ex- change declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports are subject to individual licensing. All exports to Israel are prohibited. Except for exports to PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN neighboring countries specified by the Foreign Exchange Committee, export proceeds must be received in con- vertible currencies within six months of shipment and must be sold to authorized dealers upon receipt. Proceeds of exports or re-exports to neighboring countries may be surrendered in the national currency of the importing country. Proceeds from Invisibles All claims of residents for services rendered to non- residents must be collected in foreign currency (or re- ceived from an External Account) and surrendered to the authorized dealer. Travelers may freely bring in foreign bank notes; imports of more than YD 5 in domestic currency are subject to a tax of 50 percent. Tourists are required to spend in foreign exchange an amount equiv- alent to YD 50 a month or US$10 a day if the duration of their stay is less than one month. Capital Virtually all capital payments and transactions require prior approval. Expatriates are normally permitted upon departure to remit their entire savings to their country of permanent residence. Foreign investments that have been approved under the Inducement to Invest Law (enacted in 1981) may be granted exemptions from import duty and various other tax facilities. Five years after invest- ment, the net value of the enterprise (calculated on the basis of assignment, actual liquidation, or book value, whichever is less) is transferable at the rate of 25 percent a year; if, however, the owner of the Yemeni, Arab, or foreign capital encounters operational difficulties, his capital may, upon approval, be re transferred to its place of origin one year after entry. This provision also applies to the reinvested part of such capital. Interest due on any loans obtained abroad after the firm concerned has been established may also be remitted, provided that all duties, taxes, and other government dues have been paid. Projects authorized under this law are exempt from income tax for up to five years from the commencement of production and may carry losses forward. Gold Only the monetary authorities and authorized dealers may purchase, hold, or sell gold bullion. Licensed gold- smiths may purchase, hold, and sell other unworked gold and gold coin and ornaments. Other residents may hold gold in the form of ornaments or numismatic coins. Exports and imports of gold by registered goldsmiths require licenses issued by the Ministry of Trade and Supply (General Department for Foreign Trade); in certain cases, the consent of the Foreign Exchange Committee must also be obtained. Departing female residents may take out gold ornaments not exceeding 20 tolas,1 subject to registration in their passports. Arriving female nationals may bring in gold ornaments up to 25 tolas duty free and up to an additional 75 tolas after paying import duty at a 1 One tola is equal to 180 grains troy or 0.4114 ounce. 523 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution YUGOSLAVIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Yugoslavia is the Yugoslav Dinar. The authorities do not maintain the exchange rate of the dinar within announced margins. All transactions, other than those effected under the procedures set forth for certain countries with which Yugoslavia has bilateral payments agreements (see section on Prescription of Currency, below), take place at an exchange rate adjusted from time to time by the authorities. The buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in the foreign exchange market in Belgrade on December 31, 1987 were Din 1,242.48 and Din 1,246.22, respectively, per US$1; on the same date, the exchange rate in terms of the U.S. dollar for trans- actions on bilateral accounts was Din 1,212.85 per US$1. Rates are also quoted for certain other currencies.1 Administration of Control The Federal Assembly formulates the decision on foreign exchange policy of the country for each year; the projections of the balance of payments and the foreign exchange balance of Yugoslavia are component parts of this decision. The Federal Executive Council (FEC) prescribes the general provisions in respect of foreign trade and exchange operations. The Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade makes decisions governing certain foreign trade transactions and issues import and export licenses and instructions when required. It is also charged with securing balanced trade with payments agreement countries. The Federal Secretariat for Finance, the Na- tional Bank of Yugoslavia, and the National Banks of the republics and autonomous provinces administer the ex- change controls. The National Bank of Yugoslavia pre- scribes the methods of payment to and from foreign countries. Access to foreign exchange for most imports is determined by an authorized bank on the basis of an enterprise's import and export record; in the case of scheduled debt service payments and specified imports, access to foreign exchange is not restricted; in the case of other imports (i.e., those subject to quota or license), the right to import and to effect the corresponding payment is determined within the Yugoslav Chamber of the Economy. Foreign exchange transactions must be carried out through an authorized bank, of which there are two types: (1) fully authorized banks, which are permitted to engage in transactions with foreign countries and may engage in all foreign exchange transactions in Yugoslavia and abroad, as well as in foreign credit operations (including the granting of guarantees); (2) banks that are authorized to 1 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dol- lars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Iraqi dinars, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kuwaiti dinars, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and European Currency Units (ECUs). conduct foreign exchange operations in Yugoslavia only; they may neither keep foreign exchange accounts abroad nor engage in foreign credit operations, except through banks authorized to engage in foreign exchange transac- tions abroad. Authorized exchange offices may only purchase foreign bank notes and traveler's checks; this status is open to all commercial and savings banks. In addition, hotels and tourist agencies, if specifically au- thorized, may also purchase foreign bank notes and traveler's checks. Commercial exports and imports may be effected by all economic organizations (both producing and trading undertakings) registered for this purpose. Economic or- ganizations that are not registered to conduct foreign trade channel their imports and exports through economic organizations that are authorized to engage in foreign trade transactions. Individual residents may not engage in foreign trade. Arrears have arisen sporadically with respect to exter- nal commercial payments. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries with which Yugoslavia has bilateral payments agreements are made in the cur- rencies, and according to the procedures, set forth in these agreements. Yugoslavia has payments agreements requiring denomination of transactions in clearing U.S. dollars with Albania, Czechoslovakia, the German Dem- ocratic Republic, Mongolia, and the U.S.S.R. Nonresident Accounts Foreign juridical and physical persons may maintain accounts denominated in foreign exchange and in dinars in Yugoslavia according to the following rules: foreigners resident outside Yugoslavia may freely open accounts in convertible currencies with fully authorized banks in Yugoslavia; foreign missions and foreigners resident in Yugoslavia may freely open accounts expressed in foreign currencies with any authorized bank. Foreign exchange accounts in convertible currencies of nonresident juridical and physical persons are kept in the currency deposited.2 Balances held in these accounts may be used for all payments in Yugoslavia, in dinars or in the currency concerned, and abroad, in any convertible currency. Transfers from these accounts are free if made in the currency in which the account is kept; outward transfers in other convertible currencies are subject to the bank holding the account being prepared to make the necessary conversion. 2 Accounts may be denominated in any of the following currencies: Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 525 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution YUGOSLAVIA Nonresident foreign exchange accounts in bilateral currencies may be opened only for certain foreign juridical and physical persons resident in Yugoslavia. Balances may be used only for dinar payments in Yugoslavia or for retransfer to the country to which the bilateral account is related. Foreign juridical and physical persons may in certain cases and under specified conditions open nonresident accounts in dinars with authorized banks. Such accounts can be credited freely with amounts whose transfer in convertible currency has been authorized. The possibility of using dinars from such accounts in Yugoslavia and the degree of transferability of the funds depend on the origin of the dinar deposits. Nonresident juridical and physical persons may also open other dinar accounts with authorized banks. These other accounts may be credited with dinars acquired in Yugoslavia in accordance with the existing regulations. Balances are, in principle, nontransferable and may be spent in Yugoslavia only for noncommercial payments by the account holder or by members of his immediate family, or by the owner and staff of foreign firms if the account holder is a foreign juridical person. If balances on these accounts derive from copyright royalties, from work performed in Yugoslavia by foreigners, from pen- sions, disability allowances, compensations to persons decorated with the Order of the National Hero, or from alimony payments, transfers may be effected under spec- ified conditions. Resident nationals may maintain foreign exchange ac- counts or foreign exchange savings deposits in convertible currencies with any authorized bank. These accounts may be credited with foreign currencies transferred from abroad, with interest paid in dinars, or kept in dinars or foreign exchange for foreign exchange accounts of Yu- goslavs temporarily working abroad. Foreign exchange accounts may be retained indefinitely and cash withdraw- als from most banks are limited to US$250 a month on the basis of the regulation of the FEC. Other payments in Yugoslavia and abroad on behalf of the account holder or members of his immediate family can be made freely; balances are not transferable to other persons or accounts (see section on Proceeds from Invisibles, below). Yugo- slav nationals residing abroad and former emigrants re- turning to Yugoslavia may also open foreign exchange accounts in Yugoslavia, subject to the same limitations. Imports and Import Payments Commercial imports may be effected only by economic organizations registered as participating in foreign trade. Most major industrial producers are so registered, in addition to economic organizations that specialize in foreign trade. For imports of certain basic foodstuffs, such as hard wheat, rice, butter, and special kinds of edible oil, quotas are fixed by the FEC; importation of such goods is carried out either by particular economic organizations or through the Federal Office for Food Reserves, on the basis of public bids. 526 For most commodities, import licenses are not required. All commodities included in the foreign trade nomencla- ture are classified into four categories: LB —free; LBO— conditionally free; K —subject to quotas; and D—subject to ad hoc licensing. Goods in the LB category are mainly medicine, medical and hospital equipment, essential materials for net ex- porting enterprises, and spare parts for existing equipment not produced in Yugoslavia. Entitlement to foreign ex- change for the importation of goods in this category is automatic. The LBO category includes raw materials, intermediate goods (including nonmerchandise services), and capital goods not produced in Yugoslavia. The ability of an enterprise to import items in this category, other than capital goods, depends on its import and export record; in the case of capital goods, the ability depends on the total value of the depreciation of its equipment and the value of its realized export. The computation of an enterprise's ability to import items in this category is undertaken by a fully authorized bank. Imports subject to quotas (K list) are raw materials, such as crude oil, coal, steel, nonferrous metals, etc., as well as equipment competing with that produced in Yugoslavia. The quotas are globally set for each product by the FEC, and are allocated among Organizations of Associate Labor (in value or volume terms) within the Yugoslav Chamber of the Economy. Such allocations are made in accordance with projections of material balances, which are based on the projected growth rates of pro- duction. If the Organizations of Associate Labor are unable to agree among themselves, or if the allocation does not correspond to established principles, the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade is authorized to determine the distribution. Imports subject to licensing by the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade (D list) include products whose impor- tation is limited by international agreements for noneco- nomic reasons (e.g., arms, drugs, and narcotics, and historical and artistic work), food products (e.g., coffee, sugar, and edible oil), and high-value types of goods (airplanes, ships, etc.). Importation of these products is allowed on an individual basis and for specific purposes. For certain goods, there is an additional requirement of accordance issued by the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade. Imports from payments agreement countries must be made in the manner prescribed in the relevant agreement and may be restricted according to the availability of funds in the appropriate clearing account. Private persons who are Yugoslav nationals and hold foreign exchange accounts with Yugoslav banks may use these funds freely to import goods for their own use or for the use of close relatives residing with them in accordance with rules governing citizens1 right to import and for purchases of domestically produced goods with dinars obtained by selling foreign exchange held in these accounts. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Yugoslav nationals who have worked at least two years abroad continuously may import capital equipment nec- essary for performance of a legally permitted professional activity, provided that such equipment is imported within a three-year period from the date of return, and that the value of each labor instrument is below Din 15 million. They may also freely import spare parts for maintenance of capital equipment. In addition, self-employed Yugoslav nationals may import intermediate goods necessary for performance of a legally permitted professional activity, up to the value of Din 4 million a year; this amount may be increased if the Yugoslav national in question employs other people. Yugoslav nationals may import motor ve- hicles through consignments if payment is made through a foreign exchange account held at a Yugoslav bank; they may also import motor vehicles directly from abroad if they have spent at least two years abroad, provided that they return for permanent residence in Yugoslavia. In addition, they may import motor vehicles inherited abroad. Imports of motor vehicles are also permissible for military invalids or foreign nationals asking for permanent resi- dence in Yugoslavia. A 1 percent tax for customs evidence and a 7 percent tax equalization charge are payable on all commodities not exempt from customs du ty. Many agricultural com- modities are subject to variable import levies. Returning resident travelers may bring in duty-free imports up to Din 200 a person. There are special facilities for full or partial exemption for payment of customs duties on certain imports by Yugoslav workers returning from abroad. Payments for Invisibles Foreign exchange to cover expenses abroad for export promotion is made freely available to exporters. Payments for other invisibles in relation to production needs may be made on the same basis as conditionally free (LBO) import payments, i.e., on the basis of a foreign exchange allocation based on the import and export record of any enterprise. Purchases of services abroad, as well as spare parts and fuel, by Yugoslav enterprises involved in international freight and passenger transportation are liberalized. There is no exchange allowance for tourist travel abroad. However, Yugoslav citizens are allowed to use balances from their foreign exchange accounts for tourist travel abroad. Under specified conditions, nonresident persons may effect the following payments abroad: payments for im- proving labor relationships, pensions, disability allow- ances, and payments to recipients of an Order of the National Hero; alimony payments, payments for court- ordered compensations or indemnities, the profits of foreign contractors performing capital construction work in Yugoslavia; and 10 percent of the proceeds from cultural, entertainment, sport, and other performances given by foreign groups or individuals. In addition, copy- right royalties are transferable abroad if such transfers are based on reciprocity and if foreign exchange resources have been provided. Payments in respect of royalties and YUGOSLAVIA alimony granted by court order are fully transferable, but if a payment is to be made to a country with which Yugoslavia maintains a bilateral payments arrangement, then such payment may be made only if the agreement in question provides for reciprocity. Transfers to con- vertible currency countries of funds realized by nonres- idents from selling property inherited in Yugoslavia can be effected on the basis of the approval of the Federal Secretariat for Finance under conditions of reciprocity in inheritances and in transfers. Authorized banks may sell foreign currency to residents for payment of specified medical treatment abroad, for remittances for court and other fees abroad, and for specified personal expenses on the basis of approval from the appropriate authorities in the republics and autono- mous provinces. Not more than Din 50,000 in domestic currency, in denominations of Din 5,000 or less, may be taken out by travelers on the first trip during the year; and not more than Din 20,000 a person may be taken out on subsequent trips during the same year. Foreign trav- elers may bring in and take out any amount in foreign exchange without declaring it. Exports and Export Proceeds Foreign exchange earned through exports of goods and services and other forms of economic cooperation with foreign countries must be surrendered to fully authorized commercial banks immediately upon repatriation. In principle, exports are free of control. Certain raw materials that are in short supply in the domestic market (including petroleum and petroleum derivatives, certain livestock, and vegetable oils) and certain other materials such as gunpowder, weapons, and narcotic drugs require licenses. Unless specifically exempted, proceeds from exports must be repatriated. The normal period of repatriation is 60 days from the date of exportation. All foreign exchange earnings must be surrendered to fully authorized banks immediately upon repatriation. Proceeds from exports on credit must be repatriated within the period of time stipulated under the credit agreement. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be repatriated within 60 days from the date on which the claim is payable. The performance of construction and engineering services is subject to approval (''accordance") by the Federal Com- mittee for Energy and Industry. Exchange proceeds may be used for payments abroad connected with the activities of the economic organization concerned, including pay- ments for purchases of equipment and other material for capital construction work abroad. The exchange proceeds are transferable to Yugoslavia within 60 days from work completion and sold to authorized banks. With specified exceptions, proceeds from services are subject to the same surrender requirements and procedures as are pro- ceeds from exports of goods. Residents who, while employed abroad, deposited their savings in foreign savings banks and obtained a"bilingual 527 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution YUGOSLAVIA savings book," issued under specific arrangements be- tween Yugoslavia and foreign banks, may withdraw their balances in the form of foreign exchange when in Yugo- slavia. Residents may hold interest-bearing foreign cur- rency accounts in Yugoslavia. The accounts may be credited with the full amount of a person's savings in foreign exchange. These accounts may be used for the personal needs of the account holder and of his immediate family; cash withdrawals are limited to US$250 for each trip and they are not transferable to other persons or accounts and may be retained indefinitely. Not more than Din 50,000 in Yugoslav bank notes, in denominations of Din 5,000 or less, may be brought in by travelers on the first trip during the year, and not more than Din 20,000 on subsequent trips during the same year. Capital The Organizations of Associated Labor and other social legal persons may borrow abroad in accordance with criteria established by the Law on Foreign Credit Rela- tions of 1985 and with the general legislation established by the FEC. Foreigners may invest in Yugoslav economic organi- zations but only through joint ventures. There is no limit on the share of foreign investment in the organization's capital. Profit transfers are permitted in proportion to the share of the foreign partner's contributions to the income generated on the basis of the resources invested and up to the amount of foreign currency earned by the joint venture from exports of goods and services. If the law governing joint ventures were to be amended, the legal provisions in force on the date of registration of a joint venture would continue to be applied during the entire life of the investment contract if the foreign investor so desires, or, at the latter's option, any more favorable provisions of the amended legislation could be applied. Foreign firms are permitted to establish representational offices in Yugoslavia. The investment income earned abroad by Yugoslav economic organizations must be repatriated within 90 days. Residents are obliged to repatriate foreign exchange held or accruing abroad on capital account. Economic organizations wishing to participate in for- eign enterprises may be allowed to export the necessary capital under special conditions set by federal law; ap- proval for such capital should be obtained from the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade, under the procedure spec- ified by existing legislation. Access to foreign exchange for debt service payments is automatic and receives priority over all other payments. Gold In 1968 the National Bank issued certain commemo- rative gold coins, which are legal tender. Foreign travelers are freely permitted to import and export these coins, subject to customs declaration, and for exports, subject to proof that they have been purchased in Yugoslavia. Residents who are private persons may hold gold coin in Yugoslavia but cannot export it except with the approval of the National Bank of Yugoslavia. Such gold coin may be sold to any authorized bank, and residents may freely hold, purchase, and sell gold jewelry and other articles of gold in accordance with the existing regulations on trade in goods and on control of articles made from precious metals. Domestic economic organizations that have been reg- istered as traders in gold may import gold jewelry under the K import regime; they may freely export gold jewelry and other articles of gold. Authorized banks may freely export gold coin. Producers may export newly mined gold or sell it to specified users at home at the average price on the international gold market. Domestic sales of newly mined gold by the producers may be made at a price that equals the average quotation in free gold markets abroad. Domestic economic organizations using gold for their normal activities may purchase gold from domestic producers or abroad on the basis of quotas allocated to each such organization individually.

Not for Redistribution ZAIRE (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Zaire is the Zaire. The official exchange rate of the zaire is freely determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the Bank of Zaire (the central bank) participates. At a weekly meeting of the authorized banks under the chairmanship of the Bank of Zaire, the official fixing rate is determined on the basis of the buying and selling bids at which demand and supply are in equilibrium. The SDR equivalent of the fixing rate is then maintained during the following week. Whatever the weekly fixing rate is, commercial banks are free to negotiate the rates in their daily transactions among themselves and with their clients. On December 31, 1987 the midpoint exchange rate of the zaire in the interbank market was Z 131.50 = US$1. The official exchange rates for the zaire against 20 currencies1 in which authorized banks (and other inter- mediaries) are permitted to deal are published daily by the Bank of Zaire; the rates for the zaire against these currencies are fixed daily by the Bank of Zaire on the basis of the SDR rates for these currencies, applying the SDR rate for the zaire that prevailed at the last weekly fixing. In addition to a commission charge of not more than 1 percent, foreign exchange transactions between the authorized commercial banks and nonbank customers are subject to an exchange control fee of 3 per mill, payable to the Bank of Zaire. There are no commission charges or exchange fees on foreign exchange transactions in the interbank market. Forward exchange transactions are permitted for a maximum period of 60 days with respect to trade, invisible, and capital transactions under certain conditions. Administration of Control The Bank of Zaire has full regulatory authority over all foreign trade and payments, including discretionary power to authorize residents to hold and use foreign exchange abroad and within Zaire. The Bank of Zaire may delegate this authority to certain bank or nonbank intermediaries. The Public Debt Management Office (OGEDEP), oper- ating under the aegis of the Department of Finance and Budget, manages the medium- and long-term external and domestic public and publicly guaranteed debt, is respon- sible for its servicing, and advises the Executive Council on external debt policy, including terms and guarantees extended by the Government on loans contracted by public, semipublic, and private enterprises. In principle, no new external borrowing may be contracted or guar- 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Burundi francs, Canadian dollars, CFA francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kenya shillings, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Rwanda francs, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. anteed by the Government without the prior advice of OGEDEP and the Bank of Zaire. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Payments from nonresidents must be received in one of the listed convertible currencies quoted daily by the Bank of Zaire (see footnote 1) or by debiting accounts maintained by nonresidents. Special authorization for the acceptance of any other currency may be given only in respect of currencies that can be exchanged freely without a discount. Except for working balances, all currencies received must be converted into a convertible currency. Payments to nonresidents must be made in one of the listed convertible currencies or by crediting their accounts in zaires. The Bank of Zaire maintains a bilateral payments agreement with the Central Bank of Angola. Settlements with the member countries of the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries (CEPGL) (Burundi and Rwanda) and the member countries of the Banque des Etats de TAfrique Centrale (BEAC)2 are made through special accounts established under arrangements con- cluded by the Bank of Zaire with the central banks of the countries concerned. Balances on these special accounts are settled on a quarterly basis in convertible currencies. Virtually all settlements (other than for re-exports) with the member countries of the BEAC are effected through the Central African Clearing House (Chambre de Com- pensation de 1'Afrique Centrale) through its account with the Bank of Zaire. Nonresident Accounts There are four categories of nonresident accounts: Nonresident Foreign Currency Accounts (comptes de non-residents en devises), Nonresident Convertible Ac- counts (comptes etr angers convertibles), Nonresident Ordinary Accounts (comptes etr angers ordinaire s), and Nonresident Special Accounts (comptes etrangers indis- ponibles). All nonresident accounts are composed of non- interest-bearing sight deposits, and no overdraft is permitted. Nonresident Foreign Currency Accounts, as well as nonresident convertible and special accounts, can be opened without the prior authorization of the Bank of Zaire at any authorized commercial bank. With a few exceptions, the opening of nonresident ordinary accounts requires the prior authorization of the Bank of Zaire; such authorization is not required when accounts are opened for embassies and other diplomatic missions (including those representing international and official multinational organizations), official civil and military 2 Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, People's Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. 529 ©International Monetary Fund.

Nonresident foreign currency accounts may be credited with foreign currency payments by residents or nonresi- dents in the following cases: (1) payments authorized by the Bank of Zaire; (2) transfers of foreign currencies from nonresident convertible accounts; (3) foreign exchange proceeds resulting directly from arbitrage transactions; (4) inward transfers in foreign currencies from nonresi- dents and from foreign exchange accounts held abroad; (5) payments in foreign currencies made by nonresidents; and (6) transfers in foreign currencies from other nonres- ident foreign currency accounts. Nonresident foreign currency accounts may be debited freely for the following purposes: (1) payments authorized by the Bank of Zaire; (2) sales of foreign currency to any authorized bank against zaires; (3) foreign exchange charges arising from arbitrage transactions authorized by the Bank of Zaire; (4) outward transfers in foreign currencies; (5) transfers to other nonresident foreign currency accounts; (6) with- drawals of bank notes or traveler's checks by the holder of such accounts; and (7) banking commissions and fees. Nonresident Convertible Accounts may be credited with (1) spot purchases of domestic currency against foreign currencies on the interbank market; (2) transfers from other nonresident convertible accounts as well as from nonresident foreign currency accounts; and (3) payments by authorized commercial banks for services rendered in Zaire and authorized for settlement in either domestic or foreign currency by the Bank of Zaire. They may be freely debited for (1) payments (with the prior authorization of the Bank of Zaire) to residents for services rendered in Zaire (excluding exports of goods and serv- ices); (2) purchases on the interbank market of foreign currencies or any other means of payment for travel expenses abroad; (3) transfers to other nonresident con- vertible accounts and purchases of bank notes or any other means of payment in zaires at any authorized commercial bank; and (4) banking commissions and fees. Nonresident Ordinary Accounts may be credited with (1) sales of foreign exchange against zaires, received as down payments or transferred from abroad; (2) transfers in zaires from nonresident convertible accounts; and (3) receipts in zaires from residents on account of services rendered in Zaire, property rentals, transportation fares, consular and chancery fees, and other services as specified by the Bank of Zaire at the time such accounts are opened. Nonresident ordinary accounts may be debited for (1) payments in zaires to residents on account of local purchases of goods and services, dues, taxes, and banking commissions and fees; (2) transfers to other nonresident ordinary accounts of the same holder; and (3) withdrawals of bank notes or any other means of payment in zaires. In addition, assets held in nonresident ordinary accounts are not transferable abroad, nor can they be transferred to nonresident convertible accounts. 530 Nonresident Special Accounts can be opened for non- residents entitled to receive specified payments on ac- count of (1) sale or rent from real estate properties and other fixed capital located in Zaire and owned by non- residents; and (2) sale of businesses and goodwill, as well as shares in agricultural, commercial, industrial, and service companies located in Zaire and owned by non- residents. In addition, all assets denominated in zaires and owned by non-Zairian residents permanently leaving Zaire must be deposited in or transferred to a Nonresident Special Account opened on behalf of or under the name of the respective persons, as must proceeds from the sale of real estate or the renting of fixed capital owned by non-Zairian residents who subsequently become nonres- idents. Accounts under this category can be debited only for (1) travel expenses incurred by the holders of such accounts up to a maximum of SDR 150 a day (for a maximum period of two months); (2) transportation fares (excluding airline tickets) incurred by the holders when traveling to Zaire; (3) transfers to religious organizations or any nonprofit cultural, philanthropic, or social orga- nizations (up to a maximum of SDR 10,000 a year); (4) banking commissions and fees; (5) local taxes payable to the Central Government of Zaire; (6) medical fees; (7) insurance and maintenance fees of fixed capital (including real estate properties); and (8) any other payment au- thorized by the Bank of Zaire. Imports and Import Payments Importation of a number of goods, including mainly arms, explosives and ammunition, narcotics, materials contrary to public morals, certain alcoholic beverages, and equipment for aerial and maritime navigation is prohibited (or requires a special authorization from the Executive Council) on grounds of public policy. Most other imports are only subject to an import declaration at the authorized banks. In general, validated import declarations remain valid for 12 months; if an importer wishes a longer validity period, it must be indicated in the import documents accompanying the import decla- ration. The validity may be extended by the authorized banks if shipment has begun; extension of the validity period requires authorization from the Bank of Zaire if shipment has not begun. Imports of goods intended for expansion of capital base or for importer's own use may be effected without a declaration for an authorized bank, provided that the value does not exceed SDR 5,000 and that they are financed by the importer's own resources. Payments for imports may be made either upon arrival or upon shipment (including payments up to 30 days from date of shipment). Payments upon shipment are author- ized, provided that the importer obtains a 6 percent rebate on the f.o.b. value. The mode of payment must be indicated on all import declaration forms. Interest pay- ments on foreign financing for imports are authorized only if the importer has obtained suppliers' credit or other form of foreign financing with a maturity of at least 90 days, and provided that no advance deposit in foreign currency with the foreign correspondent of the authorized ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution bank involved has been made. A detailed record of all financing charges is required to be submitted by the foreign correspondent to the domestic authorized bank and is used as a basic document to justify any payments of import financing charges. Financing charges are treated as invisible payments associated with the import trans- action involved. Authorized banks are allowed to pay transportation and insurance costs in foreign currency only on imports for which they pay on an f.o.b. basis. The amount, the invoice price, and the quality of all imports must be verified and found acceptable by the foreign agents of the Office Zairois de Controle (OZAC); however, verification may be effected upon arrival by establishing a guarantee. Importers are not required to submit to their banks the verification certificates delivered by OZAC (or any of its agents abroad) with respect to preshipment controls for imports payable upon arrival with a value (f.o.b.) of less than SDR 5,000. Prior approval of the Bank of Zaire is required for (1) imports transported by foreign air carriers with charges payable in foreign currency, if such costs exceed the f.o.b. value by 20 percent; (2) imports in the form of foreign contributions to capital intended for resale; (3) imports financed by suppliers' credits or other interest- bearing foreign financing with a maturity of more than one year, except imports contracted or guaranteed by the Government; and (4) imports requiring a down payment in foreign currency prior to shipment. Imports effected under bilateral aid arrangements be- tween Zaire and specified countries (Belgium, Canada, the People's Republic of China, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) are governed by separate provisions. Payments for Invisibles In principle, all payments for invisibles are subject to authorization by the Bank of Zaire. The Bank of Zaire will not authorize the payment in foreign exchange of commissions in favor of shippers or purchasing agents. Zairian freight must be handled exclusively by bonded shipowners whose freight charges have been authorized in advance by the Office Zairois de Gestion des Frets Maritimes. Banks may effect freight payments only on submission of invoices by the shippers or their agents. Other payments relating to services performed by nonresidents are, in principle, permitted. However, out- ward remittances of salaries of expatriate employees are limited to the levels authorized during the preceding year. The transfer abroad of salaries of newly hired expatriates is limited to 50 percent of net salary, provided that the nontransferable amount is sufficient to meet local needs. Transfers pertaining to certain administrative expenses that firms incur abroad, interest on private loans, and payment of certain portions of insurance premiums are generally permitted. Transfers of net profits of firms with foreign participation are authorized. Transfers of nonres- idents' rental income are suspended. Payments for com- missions, brokerage charges and miscellaneous fees, and royalties may be authorized in some cases. ZAIRE Tickets for travel abroad may be purchased in zaires for trips starting in Zaire. Zairian nationals traveling abroad may buy foreign exchange in amounts that depend on the duration of the journey and the status of the traveler. Zairian nationals residing in Zaire are allowed to purchase foreign exchange at the authorized commer- cial banks to cover the following expenses: travel, medical treatment, students' tuition and living costs, and training abroad. For trips to Burundi and Rwanda, tourists and households residing in the border area are entitled to purchase once a month the equivalent of SDR 100 in Burundi or Rwanda francs. The import of Zairian notes, coin, and other Zairian means of payment, by both residents and nonresidents, is prohibited. However, the import of such means of payment by travelers from Burundi and Rwanda is au- thorized within the limits of the agreements between the members of the CEPGL. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports not covered by general declarations require individual declarations. Banks are normally authorized to validate such declarations. The declaration must specify the nature of the merchandise to be exported, the price, and the currency in which payment is to be received. Declarations of foreign exchange commitment are nor- mally valid for 90 days; the export proceeds must be received and surrendered within this period. Unless otherwise provided, export proceeds must be received within 45 days. Coffee may be exported only by recog- nized coffee exporters; such exports are subject to quality control. Special provisions apply to mineral production of the Generate des Carrieres et des Mines du Zaire, which is authorized to retain 45 percent of its net export proceeds with banks abroad or in Zaire for meeting its own payments abroad and must surrender the remainder to the Bank of Zaire. Partial nonrepatriation and retention abroad are also permitted for a limited number of other enterprises, including the Societe de Developpement Industriel et Minier du Zaire (SODIMIZA—65 percent) and the Societe Miniere de Bakwanga (MIBA—20 percent), and full retention of export receipts in accounts abroad is per- mitted for a number of other enterprises, including the oil corporations. The trade of artisanal gold and diamonds is, in principle free, with exports being channeled through authorized marketing agencies (comptoirs agrees). In- dustrial diamonds are sold through the De Beers Group. Minimum export prices have been established for coffee, cocoa, tea, ivory, papain, rauwolfia, and cinchona. The export of Zairian notes and coin and other Zairian means of payment is prohibited. Proceeds from Invisibles Authorized banks may retain all their foreign exchange receipts from invisibles on the same basis as their export receipts. Travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes or other means of payment denominated in foreign 531 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAIRE currency, provided that they are declared to immigration upon entering Zaire. Declaration of means of payment denominated in for- eign currency is not required upon departure. Capital The repatriation of foreign capital brought in under the provisions of the Investment Code is permitted only at the time of liquidation; the transfer of profits and dividends from such capital is guaranteed. With minor exceptions, other transfers abroad of capital owned by residents or nonresidents are not authorized. The net foreign currency asset position of authorized banks is not permitted to exceed 40 percent of their own resources. Gold Only Zairian nationals are allowed to purchase, trans- port, sell, or hold gold within Zaire, outside the boundaries of areas covered by exclusive mining concessions. Foreign individuals or corporate persons and corporate persons under Zairian law may do so only on behalf of and for account of authorized marketing agencies. With the ex- ception of jewelry, imports and exports of gold require prior authorization from the Bank of Zaire. Gold produced by mining companies is purchased by the Bank of Zaire under agreed terms. The Bank of Zaire may authorize part of the gold produced by these companies to be sold to residents for their industrial activities. There is free trade in domestic gold mined by small-scale producers. Changes During 1987 Resident Foreign Exchange Accounts July I. Residents were permitted to deposit the proceeds from foreign loans or sales of foreign stocks in resident foreign exchange accounts (both sight and deposit). Res- idents not wishing to repatriate their funds were required to reapply for permission to hold accounts abroad. July 15. Physical or legal residents of Zaire, regardless of nationality, were entitled to open and maintain, without the authorization of the Bank of Zaire, foreign exchange accounts (Comptes Resident Monnaies Etrangeres) with authorized banks in all currencies for which the Bank of Zaire publishes exchange rates; the accounts may be composed of sight deposits or of interest-bearing term deposits. The accounts may be credited with: (1) receipts from authorized foreign exchange operations, including amounts from abroad in settlement of such operations; (2) bank notes and other means of payment; (3) transfers from other foreign exchange accounts held, either in Zaire or abroad, by the owner of the account; and (4) interest earned on the account. The accounts may be debited with (1) transfers to other foreign exchange accounts held by the same person; (2) payments for certain imports; (3) payments for fees, freight, services, dividends, and capital transfers to nonresidents; (4) purchase of foreign ex- change, traveler's checks, and other authorized means of payment; (5) foreign travel expenses, up to a limit of SDR 5,000; and (6) bank charges. Imports and Import Payments June 1. The limit on imports for which importers are not required to submit to their banks OZAC verification certificates with respect to preshipment controls for im- ports payable upon arrival was raised from SDR 1,000 to SDR 5,000. June 1. Prior approval of the Bank of Zaire was not required for imports (1) in the form of foreign grants; (2) contributing to physical capital of enterprises; and (3) financed with suppliers' credits or other interest-bearing foreign financing with a maturity exceeding one year. Exports and Export Proceeds June 29. Export taxes on all primary products, except wood, coffee, minerals, and petroleum, were eliminated. 532 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAMBIA (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Zambia is the Zambian Kwacha, for which the intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate of the Kwacha is pegged to the U.S. dollar at K 8 per US$1. Most of the foreign exchange allocations are made by the Foreign Exchange Management Com- mittee (FEMAC) on the basis of predetermined priorities. Other transactions through the "no-funds-involved" li- censes and the export retention scheme require approval by the Committee. The Bank of Zambia deals with the Government and with authorized banks in U.S. dollars, pounds sterling, and other convertible currencies. Authorized banks are free to deal in other currencies at rates based on daily rates provided by the Bank of Zambia, or on the basis of cross rates with the U.S. dollar prevailing in international foreign exchange markets. In its dealings with the com- mercial banks, the Bank of Zambia applies a margin of 0.25 percent for purchases and sales of foreign exchange.1 On December 31, 1987 the Bank of Zambia's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were K 7.9800 = US$1 and K 8.020 = US$1, respectively. Authorized banks are permitted to charge an additional 1 percent on either side for transactions by telegraphic transfers, and 1.25 percent for sales and purchases of foreign currency notes, when quoting their rates to customers. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Zambia under powers delegated to it by the Minister of Finance. The control of trade is the responsibility of the Ministry of Commerce, which also issues import and export licenses. Overall import policy is formulated by the Ministerial Committee on Foreign Exchange. Allo- cation of foreign exchange, however, is made by FEMAC. Arrears are maintained with respect to external payments. Prescription of Currency Authorized payments, including payments for imports, by residents of Zambia to residents of other countries may be made in any foreign currency. Payments from residents of other countries may be received in pounds sterling or in Zambian currency from an External Account, or in any foreign currency freely exchangeable for U.S. dollars or pounds sterling. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in Zambian currency held with authorized banks by residents of other countries are designated Nonresident Accounts.2 These accounts may be credited 1 Effective January 30, 1988, a levy of 1 percent was imposed on the sale of foreign exchange by the commercial banks. 2 Authorized banks are required to obtain prior permission from the exchange control authorities before designating any new External Ac- count, except when the account is to be opened for a temporary visitor. with authorized payments from residents of Zambia, with transfers from other Nonresident Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of any foreign currency by nonresi- dents to authorized banks. They may be debited for payments for any purpose to residents of Zambia, for transfers to other Nonresident Accounts, and for pur- chases of any foreign currency from dealers with prior exchange control permission. Blocked Accounts in Zambian currency held with authorized dealers in foreign exchange by residents of any country other than Zambia are credited with non- transferable capital sums in Zambian currency. All debits and credits to such accounts require the prior approval of the exchange control authorities, except that the accounts of emigrants may be debited each year for the permitted anniversary allowance for a remittance to the country of residence of the account holder. Normally, approval is given for the investment of balances on Blocked Accounts in Zambian securities, provided that these are held in Zambia to the order of an authorized dealer. The interest on Blocked Account balances is freely transferable to the account holder's country of residence. Imports and Import Payments The import from all countries of certain specified commodities is prohibited for reasons of health, safety, or public policy. Personal and household effects, samples, diplomatic shipments, and means of transportation en- tering Zambia temporarily do not require individual import licenses, nor do any other goods for personal use and consumption, provided that the person importing them does not import more than K 50 worth of such goods in any period of 90 days. However, no payment may be made for goods not licensed, even where the value is less than K 50. The Controller of Customs is authorized to admit emergency goods imported without prior reference to the Ministry of Commerce. All other imports require individual import licenses. Import licenses are issued in accordance with the priorities established by FEMAC; fees amounting to 5 percent of the value of the imported goods are levied in this connection. Importers must obtain foreign ex- change by submitting an application to FEMAC before import licenses can be issued. Subsequently, the com- mercial banks will open usance letters of credit, and all financial arrangements between importers and foreign suppliers for the supply of goods on credit must be approved by the Bank of Zambia. Importers intending to import goods not involving use of official foreign exchange must obtain the prior approval of FEMAC before applying to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry for a 4'no- funds-involved" import license. The Bank of Zambia does not approve payments for imports unless a satisfac- 533 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAMBIA tory report regarding preshipment inspection is issued by international agencies. The commercial banks are required to submit to the Bank of Zambia a weekly return on letters of credit opened, giving specified information. Most imported goods are subject to a sales tax of 15 percent of taxable value, which is calculated on the basis of 120 percent of the customs value, plus the applicable customs duty. Payments for Invisibles Payments in foreign exchange for freight and other import-related charges require the prior approval of the Bank of Zambia before application can be made to FEMAC for allocation of foreign exchange. The basic allowance for business travel is US$180 a person a day for up to 14 days a calendar year; foreign exchange for this purpose must have the prior approval of the exchange control authorities. Foreign exchange allowance for tourist travel is not granted. Travel allowance of US$50 a trip is granted to children returning to schools overseas. Remittances abroad of part or all of payments for advertising, management, accounting, administrative, en- gineering, and consulting services rendered to residents by nonresidents must be made by using foreign exchange authorized by FEMAC. Profits and dividends declared after October 31, 1985 of subsidiaries and branches of com- panies whose head offices are situated outside Zambia may be transferred abroad up to 15 percent of the nonresident share of the equity capital, or 50 percent of net profits accruing to the nonresident owners of incor- porated companies, whichever is smaller, with foreign exchange obtained through FEMAC. Expatriate farmers are permitted to remit 12.5 percent of their after-tax profits, including profits earned from a partnership or private limited company engaged in farming. A further 10 percent may be held to their credit every year for eventual remittance when they leave Zambia. Such re- mittances are allowed once a year after the end of the accounting year. The remittance of depreciation allow- ances is not permitted. Airlines that do not land and pick up passengers in Zambia are not allowed to remit funds abroad, except for those funds already accumulated in Zambia. Foreign nationals employed in Zambia may remit up to K 34,080 a year in monthly installments as an "in- ducement allowance." In addition, they may remit an end-of-contract gratuity of up to 25 percent of the cu- mulative inducement allowances. The payments of ex- patriates employed by the Zambian Consolidated Mining Company (ZCCM) are made from their own allocations of foreign exchange, whereas ail other payments are to be made from the working balance of commercial banks. Foreign nationals availing themselves of these arrange- ments are not entitled to the regular allowances for travel, education, and maintenance; their leave salary, gratuity, and other terminal benefits are transferable only on completion of the contract period. Travelers leaving 534 Zambia may take out a maximum of K 10 in Zam- bian currency. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports valued at over K 50 require a license, except those covered by an open general license; minerals are exported under general agreements with the mining companies. The export of certain metals is reserved, in principle, for an official agency, the Metal Marketing Corporation. Certain commodities are subject to licensing mainly to ensure domestic supplies of needed goods and of certain strategic materials, such as implements of war, lead in any form, certain minerals, petroleum products, certain rough and uncut precious stones, scrap and old metals, maize, and jute bags. For most goods, however, export licenses are issued freely. Export proceeds in foreign currency appropriate to the country of destination must be surrendered to the Bank of Zambia within one month after receipt; the ZCCM credits its export proceeds to a Bank of Zambia account in London upon receipt and is allocated an amount judged necessary to meet its own foreign exchange needs. All exports must be financed through irrevocable letters of credit and be registered with the Bank of Zambia. Prior approval of the Bank of Zambia is required for all exports for which the methods of payment are different from those mentioned above. As an export incentive, up to 50 percent of nontraditional export proceeds is allowed to be used by the exporter. However, all such export receipts must be surrendered in full to the Bank of Zambia by commercial banks, and exporters must apply to FEMAC for reallocation of the surrendered export proceeds for their import financing requirements. Nonnational agricultural producers are eligible for cer- tain incentives in the form of foreign exchange, on the basis of every standard bag of maize, wheat, soybean, or tobacco sold by them in excess of the prescribed number of bags. Corresponding foreign exchange incentives for national agricultural producers are made available on application to the exchange control authorities. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in any currency must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. There is no limitation on the amount of foreign currency notes that may be imported by travelers, except that travelers from Zaire are allowed to import only up to the equivalent of K 20. Travelers arriving in Zambia may bring in a maximum of K 10 in Zambian currency. Capital Inward transfers of capital are not restricted, but with the exception of overseas short-term financing of imports other than certain capital goods, all borrowings outside Zambia require the approval of the exchange control authorities. Outward transfers of capital are controlled, but nonresidents are normally permitted to repatriate their investments when they have satisfied the authorities that the original investment was made with funds brought ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution into the country from sources outside Zambia. The repatriation is generally spread over a period longer than three years. Local borrowing by companies controlled either directly or indirectly from outside Zambia is re- stricted to a debt-equity ratio of 1 to 3. However, the Bank of Zambia permits borrowings in excess of this limit for certain priority sectors of the economy, provided that the borrowings secure higher employment opportunities or savings of foreign exchange. In general, residents are not permitted to transfer capital abroad and, with certain exceptions, are required to offer for sale to an authorized bank any foreign exchange accruing to them. As a special measure, however, resi- dents may purchase Zambian securities quoted on rec- ognized stock exchanges abroad, provided that the se- curities so acquired are registered in the names of specified nominees and that, in the event of subsequent disposal of these securities, the sales proceeds will be repatriated. All income earned from these investments must be repatriated. Emigrants are granted foreign exchange as follows: (1) settling-in allowance of the equivalent of K 6,000 for a single person, K 8,000 for a married couple, K 12,000 for persons aged 50 years and over, and K 500 a child up to a maximum of four children; and (2) anniversary allowance of the equivalent of K 3,000 for a single person, K 6,000 for a married couple, and K 7,500 for persons aged 50 years and over. In addition, there are special facilities for expatriate farmers for the transfer of profits up to certain limits (see section on Payments for Invisibles, above). Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Zambia for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized in- dustrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require exchange control approval as well as import or export licenses issued by the Minister of Commerce; such licen- ses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Gold-bearing sludge is exported by cop- per companies for refining and sale abroad. Foreign exchange for imports of gold may be provided with the permission of the Bank of Zambia. Changes During 1987 Exchange Arrangement January 31. The Kwacha was pegged to a basket of currencies of Zambia's main trading partners and allowed to float within a band of K 9-12.50 per US$1. March 17. A two-tier exchange system, comprising an official exchange rate and an auction-determined exchange rate, was introduced. The official exchange rate was to be determined daily with reference to a basket of curren- cies of Zambia's leading trading countries, at an initial rate of K 9 per US$1, and would fluctuate within a band ZAMBIA of K 9-12.50 per US$1. This rate would apply to govern- ment procurement of medical and educational supplies, external debt servicing by the Government and Bank of Zambia, and external loan and grant receipts of the Government. The auction-determined rate was to be the marginal bid at which the foreign exchange offered for sale at the auction was exhausted. Successful bidders, excluding small-scale industries and agriculture, would purchase foreign exchange at their bidding rate, and bidders from small-scale industries and agriculture would purchase foreign exchange at the market clearing marginal bid rate. The interest-free deposit that was required to accompany each bid was increased to 40 percent. A limit of 5 percent of available auctionable funds was introduced for all bids, except for Zimoil Company and Zambia Airways. April 27. The following new requirements for release of the interest-free deposits accompanying successful bids were introduced: (1) written confirmation that the cor- respondent bank has been paid; (2) evidence of payments of customs duty, when the bid was for the importation of goods; and (3) bills of entry as proof that goods have arrived in the country. May 2. The two-tier exchange rate system was abol- ished, and, effective May 4, 1987, the exchange rate was set at K 8 per US$1 for all transactions. Imports and Import Payments May 8. Applications for foreign exchange and/or import licenses, including "no-funds-involved" import licenses, were required to be submitted to FEMAC through the commercial banks. The Secretariat of FEMAC (1) verifies that the application is in the proper form, supported by the required documentation, and accompanied by the Kwacha equivalent cover; and (2) makes recommenda- tions to FEMAC for allocation of foreign exchange and/or authority to obtain an import license. Applications for which foreign exchange was not allocated because of insufficient foreign exchange may be resubmitted. Doc- umentation requirements are the same as those prevailing under the auction system. The importer must open letters of credit through his bank within 21 days after obtaining import licenses. The bank must approach the Bank of Zambia for release of foreign exchange cover, and issue letters of credit within ten days, or surrender foreign exchange to the Bank of Zambia. June 5. Applications for foreign exchange were required to indicate the nature of business of the applicant and to disclose the shareholders of the company or partners in a firm, indicating the nationality and extent of the share- holding. In cases where applicants are engaged in export business, applications must indicate the nature of exports, the total gross export receipts in 1986, and the projected receipts for the period June-December 1987. June 12. Documents issued by the relevant government ministry/department were required to accompany all ap- plications for foreign exchange. Importers were also required to produce proof of international agencies' in- 535 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAMBIA spection regarding quality and price of goods to be imported. August 4. The rules governing the export retention scheme and t h e4 'no-funds-involved" import licenses were modified. All applications must be approved by the Bank of Zambia, and "no-funds-involved" import licenses were restricted to imports of essential consumer goods, inputs, and machinery that are not available domestically. For 4'no-funds-involved" import licenses, information regard- ing seller's final invoice, certificate of value of exports of goods to Zambia, bill of lading, and airway bill or other document indicating prepayment of freight were required. Payment for Invisibles February 16. A departure fee for international travelers of US$10 was established. May 4. Remittances of salaries by expatriates on contract employment was limited to one third of the contract earnings, up to a maximum of K 9,600 a year. May 4. The holiday travel allowance was no longer granted. May 4. Remittances of fees for both primary and secondary education and family maintenance were pro- hibited, except for students who were already registered with exchange control and continuing with their studies. May 4. Remittances falling under Service and Royalties Agreements were suspended, and all existing agreements were required to be resubmitted to exchange control authorities for review. September 8. Insurance on imports was required to be arranged with Zambia State Insurance Corporation, ex- cept for imports funded through the US AID. (This reg- ulation was canceled on September 22, 1987.) September 22. The regulation requiring insurance on imports to be arranged with Zambia State Insurance Corporation was rescinded. Exports and Export Proceeds January 12. The period during which exporters were allowed to retain 50 percent of foreign exchange proceeds for their own use was extended from 21 days to 60 days. June 5. Export proceeds were required to be surren- dered to the Bank of Zambia. August 27. Expatriate workers, other than those who used to remit inducement allowances prior to May 1, 1987, were prohibited from remitting such allowances. Contract remittances by expatriate workers were re- stricted to the equivalent of K 34,080 a year, plus 25 percent of this amount for gratuity. This limit would apply until the contract or the work permit expires, whichever is earlier. December 8. Use of export retention proceeds was allowed for importation for third parties for the manufac- ture of essential products and business travel allowance for export promotion purposes. Capital May 11. Foreign creditors with outstanding claims in arrears were authorized to withdraw counterpart deposit funds for reinvestment in the agricultural, manufacturing, and transportation sectors. These investments would be treated as new foreign direct investment for exchange control purposes. Remittances of profits and dividends accrued from these investments will be permitted under the exchange control regulations. 536 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZIMBABWE (Position on December 31, 1987) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Zimbabwe is the Zimbabwe Dollar. The exchange rate of the Zimbabwe dollar is determined on the basis of a fixed relationship to a trade-weighted basket of currencies. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. The spread applied by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe between the buying and selling rates is 0.8 percent for major currencies and 1.0 percent for other currencies. An additional 0.25 percent on either side of the quoted rates of major currencies may be charged by authorized dealers (authorized commercial and merchant banks). The authorized dealers base their rates for other currencies on current international market rates. On December 31, 1987 the buying and selling rates were US$0.6037 and US$0.5989, respectively, per Z$l. Forward exchange contracts are permitted only for trade transactions. There is no limit on the amount of such contracts, but these must be limited to periods of three to six months. The Reserve Bank is prepared to cover forward transactions and, at present, quotes fixed discount or premium rates for major currencies. The Reserve Bank purchases foreign exchange at the spot preferential telex transfer rate quoted to authorized deal- ers, less 0.35 percent for three-month contracts and an additional 0.10 percent for each month beyond three months up to 0.65 percent for a six-month contract. Sales of foreign exchange take place at the spot preferential telex transfer rate plus 0.65 percent for three-month contracts and an additional 0.30 percent for each month up to 1.55 percent for a six-month contract. Authorized dealers are expected to quote to their customers their own telex transfer (sight rates plus or minus the margins applied by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe). Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank, under powers delegated to it by the Minister of Finance, Economic Planning, and Development under the Ex- change Control Act, Chapter 170, and the Exchange Control Regulations of 1977. Authorized dealers have been empowered to approve certain foreign exchange transactions in accordance with Exchange Control In- structions Issued to Authorized Dealers (July 1, 1981, as amended) and Exchange Control Circulars, issued pe- riodically. Import and export controls are administered in accordance with the Control of Goods (Import and Export) (Agriculture) Regulations of 1965, as amended; the Control of Goods (Import and Export) (Commerce) Regulations of 1974, as amended; the Control of Goods (Export of Minerals and Metals) Order, 1979; the Control of Goods (Open General Import License) Notice of 1979; and the Control of Goods (Open General Export License) Notice, 1977. Prescription of Currency All payments by nonresidents to residents must be effected in denominated currencies,1 with the exception of payments otherwise specified or effected through nonresident accounts. Under the Clearing House Agree- ment, which went into effect on February 1, 1984, within the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern African States (PTA), residents of member countries can use national currencies in day-to-day payments during a transaction period of two calendar months; the monetary authorities settle net balances at the end of this period in convertible currencies. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident accounts may be opened with the approval of the exchange control authorities by persons who have never been residents of Zimbabwe. Nonresident accounts may be credited with foreign currencies, with payments from other nonresident accounts, or with payments by residents that would be eligible for transfer outside Zim- babwe. Nonresident accounts may be debited for pay- ments to residents, for payments to other nonresident accounts, or for payments abroad. Only former residents now residing outside Zimbabwe may maintain emigrants' accounts in Zimbabwe. Cash assets held in Zimbabwe in the names of emigrants must be blocked in these accounts, and all payments to and from these accounts are strictly subject to various exchange restrictions. Imports and Import Payments With the exception of a few products covered by the Open General Import License (OGIL), all imports are subject to licensing requirements. Import licenses are issued only against a certificate of foreign exchange allocation. Global foreign exchange allocations are de- cided by an Interministerial Committee, chaired by the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning, and Develop- ment, and are made available through the Ministry of Trade and Commerce and the Ministry of Industry and Technology. The Ministry of Trade and Commerce bas- ically handles allocations for goods in the commercial category, and those in the industrial category are handled by the Ministry of Industry and Technology. Imports in the commercial category include imports by merchants of raw materials, machinery, and spare parts for resale to manufacturers and the public sector, as well as consumer goods; those in the industrial category consist of direct importation by industrialists of raw materials, machinery, and spare parts. For purposes of allocating 1 There are 17 denominated currencies that are freely convertible through authorized dealers: Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japa- nese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, South African rand, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 537 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZIMBABWE commercial imports, individual products are classified into five categories in accordance with the degree of essentiality. (In the manufacturing sector, because of employment considerations, similar priority ratings are not so strictly applied.) Foreign exchange is allocated to individual commercial importers for single tariff items (with facilities for a limited degree of transferability between items), whereas foreign exchange allocated to manufacturers is for a group of tariff items appropriate to the industrial division concerned. Manufacturers receive through the Ministry of Industry and Technology separate allocations for raw materials required for production for the local and export markets; the former is assessed on the basis of priority and foreign exchange availability, and the latter is in the form of initial allocations based on past performance, with pos- sible additional allocation from an export revolving fund against proof of exports. Industrial exporters may also receive a supplementary allocation, determined on the basis of their incremental export performance, to import raw materials to be used in production for the domestic market. Export-oriented mining and agricultural firms may obtain supplemental allocations under the export promotion program. Import licenses have to be drawn against foreign ex- change allocation certificates at the time orders are placed. The normal validity of import licenses is 12 months from the end of the month of issue, but the validity period can be extended in certain circumstances. Import licenses are normally issued without geographical restriction, and importers are free to choose the country of supply. Licenses are issued on an f.o.b. basis and do not, therefore, cover the invisibles element of the transactions. Imports of certain goods (mostly agricultural and proc- essed food products) require a special permit issued by the Ministry of Agriculture. Certain agricultural products (coffee, maize, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat) may be imported only by the Grain Marketing and Cotton Mar- keting Boards or by others with the permission of the Boards. No quotas are in force, but seasonal restrictions are applied to certain agricultural products. Authorized dealers may approve applications to effect payments for authorized imports, provided necessary documentation (including the details of import licenses or open general licenses) is submitted. Payments for imports into Zimbabwe from all countries may be made in Zimbabwean currency to a local nonresident account or in any foreign currency. The customs duty regime consists mainly of ad valorem duties, which range up to 40 percent, and specific duties on a number of products. Generally, imports are subject to additional taxes equivalent to the sales tax imposed at the same rates on goods sold domestically. Most imports are subject to a surtax of 20 percent. Payments for Invisibles Foreign exchange to pay for invisibles related to imports and, within certain limits for other purposes, is provided by commercial banks under delegated authority. Appli- 538 cations for foreign exchange exceeding the limit estab- lished for commercial banks are approved by the Reserve Bank, which deals with each case on its merits. The basic foreign exchange allowance for holiday travel is Z$60 a day, up to a maximum of Z$450 for a 12-month period. The allowance may be accumulated up to three years but it is not granted in advance. (Children under 10 years are entitled to one half of these amounts.) A tax of 20 percent is applied on sales of foreign exchange for purposes of holiday travel. The basic foreign exchange allowance for import-related business travel is Z$100 a day, up to a maximum of Z$ 1,500 a trip, with an overall annual maximum of Z$3,000; for export-related business travel, the exchange allowance is Z$125 a day, for a maximum of Z$2,000 a trip and an annual limit of Z$4,000. Applications for business travel allowance exceeding the specified limits are subject to the approval of the Reserve Bank. Foreign exchange is provided for education abroad beyond the secondary school level within the following limits: Z$4,000 a year for education at universities other than those in the United States and the United Kingdom, and Z$ 10,000 a year for education at specified universities in the United States and the United Kingdom. For medical treatment, foreign exchange is provided up to Z$20 a day for a maximum period of 30 days for the patient and any necessary accompanying companion. Remittances of up to Z$40 for subscriptions to religious and educational societies, and Z$20 for other societies are allowed; the limit for an initial membership fee is Z$50. Remittances to close relatives permanently resident outside Zimbabwe, not exceeding Z$30 a month for each individual beneficiary and Z$60 a month for each family unit, are permitted with the approval of the Reserve Bank. Outward remit- tances in respect of fees for technical, administrative, management, and consultancy services, or to defray external expenses of local branches are subject to a tax of 20 percent. Previously blocked fund s, whether already converted into government bonds or not, can qualify as new venture capital if they are reinvested in Zimbabwe in an approved project and matched by an inflow of investment funds of between zero and 50 percent of the reinvested blocked funds, as determined by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. As new venture capital, the total investment will be eligible for remittable dividends for up to 50 percent of after-tax profits. However, the "blocked" portion of the new investment, unlike new venture capital, must remain reinvested in Zimbabwe for a minimum of five years or more, depending on individual cases. Applications for emigrant status must be submitted to the Reserve Bank. Beginning from March 27, 1984, the settling-in allowance that can be remitted abroad by emigrants is limited to Z$ 1,000 per family unit. In excep- tional and deserving cases, the exchange control author- ities will consider applications exceeding this maximum. Beginning from April 1, 1984, all those applying for emigrant status have been required to take steps to liquidate their assets within a period of six months and ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution to invest the total proceeds, less any settling-in allowance granted, in 4 percent, 12-year Government of Zimbabwe external bonds. In exceptional cases of emigrants unable to comply with the six-month limit, the matter may be referred to the Reserve Bank. Before these changes, transferable allowances at the time of emigration were as follows: (1) single persons under the age of 40 years, Z$500; (2) single persons aged 40-59 years, Z$l,000; (3) family units and single persons with dependents (under 60 years of age), Z$l,000; (4) family units (husband over 60 years of age) and single persons over 60, Z$7,000; (5) persons over 80 years of age, Z$10,000; (6) widows (no age restriction), Z$10,000; and (7) handicapped or disabled persons, Z$10,000. A further release of capital was au- thorized as an annual allowance on each anniversary date of the emigrant's departure, as follows: persons over 65 years of age, Z$2,000; and persons over 70 years of age, Z$3,000. Travelers leaving Zimbabwe may take out, as part of the travel allowance, not more than Z$20 in Zimbabwean currency together with a maximum of the equivalent of Z$20 in foreign bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out the traveler's checks they brought in less the amount sold to authorized dealers. Upon departure from Zimbabwe, nonresident travelers may reconvert unspent Zimbabwean currency into foreign currencies on pres- entation of exchange certificates. Exports and Export Proceeds Licenses are required to export certain products that are not covered by the OGIL; these include (1) any ore, concentrate, or other manufactured product of chrome, copper, lithium, nickel, tin, or tungsten; (2) petroleum products; (3) jute and hessian bags; (4) road or rail tankers for carrying liquids or semiliquids; (5) bitumen, asphalt, and tar; (6) wild animals and wild animal products; (7) certain wood products; (8) ammonium nitrate; and (9) implements of war. In addition to security and social reasons, export licensing requirements are intended to ensure adequate domestic supply of essential products. Goods may not be exported without permission, unless the customs authorities are satisfied that payment has been made in an approved manner or will be so made within three months from the date of shipment or such longer period as may be permitted by the Reserve Bank. Payments for exports must be received in the following manner: (1) in a denominated currency; (2) in Zimbabwean currency from a nonresident account; and (3) in the case of Malawi and Botswana, by checks drawn in Malawi kwacha or Botswana pula, respectively. Under the PTA arrangement (see section on Prescription of Currency, above), member countries can use national currencies in the settlement of payments during a transaction period of two months, with net balances at the end of this period to be settled in convertible currencies. Exports to some 50 countries are approved only upon advance payment of export proceeds or if payment is covered by an irrevocable letter of credit issued or confirmed prior to ZIMBABWE export by a reputable overseas bank. Export receipts must be sold to authorized dealers. Since August 1, 1984, an export subsidy at the rate of 9 percent of the f.o.b. value has been granted on specified exports of nontraditional products with a minimum do- mestic value-added of 25 percent. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles are required to be sold to authorized banks within a reasonable period of time. Residents performing professional services abroad are not permitted to retain any part of their foreign exchange earnings, and such earnings are required to be sold to an authorized bank. Foreign currency and traveler's checks may be imported without restrictions but must be sold or exchanged in Zimbabwe only through authorized dealers. A traveler may bring in Zimbabwean currency up to a maximum of Z$20. Capital Inward transfers of capital through normal banking channels are not restricted. Outward transfers of capital are controlled, but all foreign investments, irrespective of their source, that are undertaken through normal banking channels since Sep- tember 1, 1979 may be considered for repatriation after two years, subject to the requirement that the amount to be repatriated will be reduced by any profits remitted in the interim. Where such authority is granted, the balance may be transferred only through the established medium of six-year external government bonds bearing interest at the rate of 4 percent a year. The repatriation of capital invested before September 1, 1979 is prohibited; however, shareholders are allowed within limits to apply to the Reserve Bank for the remittance of such capital upon the sale of shares to local residents, and if such application is approved, the capital is invested in external government bonds bearing interest at the rate of 4 percent a year and carrying a maturity of 12 years in the case of individuals, or 20 years in the case of firms. Beginning from March 27, 1984, former residents hold- ing blocked assets and new emigrants are allowed to invest their funds in Government of Zimbabwe external bonds with a maturity of 12 years and an annual interest rate of 4 percent. The remittability of the Zimbabwean pension of a former resident is guaranteed under the Constitution. All other outward transfers of capital are subject to approval by the Reserve Bank, as are dealings in external securities. Gold The export of gold in unmanufactured form is controlled and licensed under the Control of Goods (Export of Minerals and Metals) Order, 1979. The administration of the Order is the responsibility of the Ministry of Mines. No person may export any precious metal and certain other specified metals and minerals unless he holds an export license; no such licenses for gold are issued. These 539 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZIMBABWE controls do not, however, apply to the Reserve Bank. The import of gold is controlled by the Gold Trade Act. The Act provides for certain requirements to be met when a person intends to import gold into Zimbabwe. No person, either as principal or agent, is entitled to deal in or possess gold unless (1) he is the holder of a license or permit; (2) he is the holder or distributor of a registered mining location from which gold is being produced; or (3) he is the employee or agent of any of the persons mentioned in (1) and (2) above, and is authorized by his employer or principal to deal in or possess gold in the lawful possession of such employer or principal. A mining commissioner may issue to any person a permit authorizing him to acquire or to be in possession of or to dispose of any gold, provided the quantity does not exceed 1 troy ounce. In all other cases, permission can only be issued by the Secretary for Mines. Three types of licenses may be issued under the terms of the Gold Trade Act: a gold dealing license, a gold recovery works license, and a gold assaying license. Barclays Bank of Zimbabwe, Ltd. is the only authorized dealer under the terms of the Act, and each holder or distributor of a registered mining location is required to lodge with this bank all gold acquired by him in the course of his operations by the tenth day of the month following that in which the gold was produced. When a person intends to smelt any gold or any article containing gold, he must first obtain a license issued by a district commissioner under the terms of the Second Hand Goods Act author- izing him to be in possession of smelting equipment. Changes During 1987 Nonresident Accounts and Resident Foreign Exchange Accounts January 2. Nonresidents above 65 years of age who are holding blocked funds without pension commutations were given the option of purchasing government bonds with an interest rate of 4 percent a year and a maturity of 12 years, or of holding non-interest-bearing deposits with banks while continuing to receive the anniversary allowance which may be transferred abroad; previously, such deposits could bear interest. Payments for Invisibles June I. Remittances of dividends and profits of branches and partnerships to nonresidents were limited to 25 percent of the current after-tax profits of companies, branches, and partnerships. Amounts declared in excess of the new limit of 25 percent would be placed in blocked accounts in the names of nonresident beneficiaries. Such blocked funds would, as before, qualify for remittances through the medium of external bonds with 12-year or 20-year maturity and an interest rate of 4 percent a year. Foreign shareholders would also be allowed to use blocked funds for reinvestment purposes in approved projects. Existing exchange control regulations, which required a matching of new investment funds from external sources on a 50-50 basis, would be liberalized accordingly; de- pending on the type of project and its contribution to exports, import substitution, and employment, the share of external financing would vary from 50 percent to zero. These joint funds would be accorded venture capital status and must remain invested for a minimum period of five years; as such, they would qualify for 50 percent dividend rights. No restrictions would apply to the re- mittability of current dividends in favor of individual shareholders who have never been residents in Zimbabwe. Dividends and profit remittances on existing venture capital invested in Zimbabwe from external sources since September 1, 1979 would not be affected by the new measures, and would continue to be permitted to be remitted on the basis of 50 percent of after-tax profits. The undeclared portion of after-tax profits would hence- forth be classified as surplus funds of non-resident- controlled organizations. The 9 percent interest ceiling on surplus funds was reduced to 5 percent a year. Companies that had declared 25 percent dividends may, instead of remitting the funds abroad, opt to retain and utilize these funds for procuring essential imports, such as materials, spare parts, and capital goods, in which case both the 20 percent withholding tax and import duties would be waived. Exports and Export Proceeds September 1. A new export promotion program was introduced to complement the existing Export Revolving Fund, under which foreign exchange is allocated to meet industrial exporters' requirements for imported raw ma- terial and capital equipment. The new program will allocate foreign exchange to the mining and agricultural sectors, targeted specifically at export-generating activi- ties. Applications for certain mining equipment and spare parts valued at Z$50,000 or less will be processed through commercial import control, but applications for projects in excess of Z$50,000 would have to be submitted through the Chamber of Mines. Also, as an incentive for industrial exporters, supplementary allocations of foreign exchange for the import of essential raw materials for domestic use will be made on the basis of a company's incremental export performance measured against its 1985/86 export receipts based on exchange control records. 540 ©International Monetary Fund.
